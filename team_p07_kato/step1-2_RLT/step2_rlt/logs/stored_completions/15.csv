Given that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{k}^{2}9^{k} \\le 5 \\), we need to prove that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le 3 \\).

We apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real sequences \\( \\{b_k\\} \\) and \\( \\{c_k\\} \\),

\\[
\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |b_k c_k| \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty b_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty c_k^2 \\right).
\\]

We express \\( |a_k| 2^k \\) as the product of \\( |a_k| 3^k \\) and \\( (2/3)^k \\). Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( |a_k| 3^k ) ( (2/3)^k ) \\leq \\sqrt{ \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( |a_k| 3^k )^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( (2/3)^k )^2 \\right) }.
\\]

Simplifying the terms inside the square roots, we have:

1. The first sum is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k^2 9^k \\), which is given to be at most 5.
2. The second sum is a geometric series with ratio \\( (4/9) \\):

\\[

Combining these results:

\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k \\leq \\sqrt{ 5 \\times \\frac{9}{5} } = \\sqrt{9} = 3.

Thus, we conclude that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le 3 \\).

","Okay, let's see. I need to prove that if the sum from k=0 to infinity of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, then the sum from k=0 to infinity of |a_k| times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, how should I approach this?

First, the problem gives me a constraint on the sum involving a_k squared with a 9^k factor, and I need to derive a bound on a different sum involving |a_k| with a 2^k factor. This seems like an application of some inequality, maybe Cauchy-Schwarz or HÃ¶lder's inequality? Let me recall the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. It states that for any real sequences {b_k} and {c_k}, the absolute value of the sum over b_k c_k is less than or equal to the product of the square roots of the sums of b_k squared and c_k squared. That is, |sum b_k c_k| <= sqrt(sum b_k^2) sqrt(sum c_k^2). 

But wait, in this problem, the sums are infinite series. However, Cauchy-Schwarz should still hold for infinite series as long as the series converge. So maybe I can apply Cauchy-Schwarz here. Let's think. If I can write the sum |a_k| 2^k as a product of two sequences, then perhaps apply Cauchy-Schwarz.

Let me denote b_k = |a_k| and c_k = 2^k. Then, the sum we want to bound is sum |a_k| 2^k = sum b_k c_k. According to Cauchy-Schwarz, this sum is less than or equal to sqrt( sum b_k^2 ) sqrt( sum c_k^2 ). But wait, sum b_k^2 is sum |a_k|^2, which is the same as sum a_k^2. However, in our given condition, we have sum a_k^2 9^k <= 5. So if I use this directly, then sum |a_k| 2^k <= sqrt( sum a_k^2 ) sqrt( sum 4^k ). But wait, sum a_k^2 is not given, only sum a_k^2 9^k. So maybe that approach isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust the Cauchy-Schwarz approach to account for the 9^k factor. Let me think. If I can write |a_k| 2^k as the product of two terms where one involves 9^k, then maybe I can use Cauchy-Schwarz on that. Let's try to manipulate the terms.

Let me consider |a_k| 2^k = |a_k| 2^k * 1. Then, if I set b_k = |a_k| 3^k and c_k = (2/3)^k, then |a_k| 2^k = b_k c_k. Then, applying Cauchy-Schwarz, sum |a_k| 2^k = sum b_k c_k <= sqrt( sum b_k^2 ) sqrt( sum c_k^2 ). 

Let's compute sum b_k^2: sum (|a_k| 3^k)^2 = sum a_k^2 9^k, which is given to be <=5. Then sum c_k^2 is sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 = sum (4/9)^k. That's a geometric series with ratio 4/9. Since 4/9 < 1, the sum converges to 1/(1 - 4/9) = 1/(5/9) = 9/5. Therefore, sum c_k^2 = 9/5.

Putting it all together, sum |a_k| 2^k <= sqrt(5) * sqrt(9/5) = sqrt(5) * (3/sqrt(5)) ) = 3. So that gives us the desired bound. Therefore, the inequality holds.

Wait, let me verify that step by step. 

Starting with |a_k| 2^k = |a_k| 3^k * (2/3)^k. Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz:

sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k = sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( |a_k| 3^k ) * ( (2/3)^k )

<= sqrt( sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( |a_k| 3^k )^2 ) * sqrt( sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( (2/3)^k )^2 )

The first sum is sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k|^2 * 9^k, which is given as <=5. The second sum is sum_{k=0}^\\infty (4/9)^k, which is a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 4/9. The sum is 1 / (1 - 4/9) = 1 / (5/9) = 9/5. So sqrt(9/5) = 3/sqrt(5). Then, sqrt(5) * 3/sqrt(5) = 3. Therefore, the sum is <=3. Hence, proved.

Yes, that seems correct. So by applying Cauchy-Schwarz with the right decomposition, we can bound the desired sum by 3. Therefore, the inequality holds.

","Okay, so I need to prove that if the sum of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, then the sum of the absolute value of a_k times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, let me think. 

First, both sums are infinite series, and they involve terms with a_k. The first condition involves a_k squared and 9^k, while the second one involves |a_k| and 2^k. I need to relate these two. Maybe I can use some inequality here. 

What comes to mind is the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. That's often useful when dealing with sums of products. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real sequences {b_k} and {c_k}, the sum of |b_k c_k| is less than or equal to the square root of the sum of b_k^2 times the square root of the sum of c_k^2. 

Let me try to apply that here. If I set b_k = a_k and c_k = 2^k, then the sum of |a_k * 2^k| would be less than or equal to sqrt( sum a_k^2 ) * sqrt( sum (2^k)^2 ). Wait, but in the given condition, the sum of a_k^2 * 9^k is bounded by 5. So maybe I need to adjust the sequences here. 

Alternatively, maybe I should set b_k = a_k * sqrt(9^k) and c_k = 1/sqrt(9^k). Then, the sum of |a_k| * 2^k can be written as the sum of (a_k * sqrt(9^k)) * (2^k / sqrt(9^k)). Let me check that. 

Yes, because sqrt(9^k) is 3^k, so 2^k / sqrt(9^k) is (2/3)^k. Then, the sum of |a_k| * 2^k equals the sum of |a_k * 3^k| * (2/3)^k. 

So, applying Cauchy-Schwarz here, the sum would be less than or equal to sqrt( sum (a_k * 3^k)^2 ) * sqrt( sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 ). 

Now, the sum (a_k * 3^k)^2 is sum a_k^2 * 9^k, which is given to be at most 5. So that sqrt term becomes sqrt(5). 

Then, the other sum is sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 = sum (4/9)^k. That's a geometric series with ratio 4/9. The sum of a geometric series is 1/(1 - ratio). So here, the sum would be 1/(1 - 4/9) = 1/(5/9) = 9/5. 

Therefore, the entire expression becomes sqrt(5) * sqrt(9/5) = sqrt(5 * 9/5) = sqrt(9) = 3. 

Wait, so that gives us that the sum of |a_k| * 2^k is less than or equal to 3. That's exactly what we needed to prove! 

Let me just verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

1. Recognize that the target sum is the sum of |a_k|*2^k.
2. Express this as the product of |a_k|*3^k and (2/3)^k.
3. Apply Cauchy-Schwarz inequality with these two sequences.
4. The first part squared is sum a_k^2*9^k, which is <=5.
5. The second part squared is sum (4/9)^k, which sums to 9/5.
6. Multiply the square roots: sqrt(5) * sqrt(9/5) = 3.
7. Hence, the original sum is <=3.

Yes, that seems correct. The key was to choose the sequences appropriately for Cauchy-Schwarz so that one of them relates to the given bound. The step where I split the sum into a product of two sequences was crucial. I think that's a solid proof.

","Okay, so I need to prove that if the sum of squared terms a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, then the sum of the absolute values of a_k times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that there are some inequalities that relate sums of different sequences. Maybe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality? That's a common tool for relating sums of products to the product of sums. Let me recall the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: for any real sequences {b_k} and {c_k}, we have that the sum of |b_k c_k| squared is less than or equal to the product of the sum of b_k squared and the sum of c_k squared. Wait, actually, the standard Cauchy-Schwarz is (sum b_k c_k)^2 â¤ (sum b_k^2)(sum c_k^2). But in this case, we need to relate the sum of |a_k| 2^k to the given sum involving a_k^2 9^k. 

So maybe I can express |a_k| 2^k as a product of two terms, such that when I apply Cauchy-Schwarz, I can relate it to the given sum. Let's see. Let's denote b_k = |a_k| 3^k and c_k = (2/3)^k. Then, the sum of |a_k| 2^k = sum (|a_k| 3^k)(2/3)^k = sum b_k c_k. Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz, (sum b_k c_k)^2 â¤ (sum b_k^2)(sum c_k^2). Let's check:

sum |a_k| 2^k = sum (|a_k| 3^k)(2/3)^k. So, applying Cauchy-Schwarz, (sum |a_k| 2^k)^2 â¤ (sum (|a_k| 3^k)^2)(sum (2/3)^{2k}).

Compute the first term: sum (|a_k| 3^k)^2 = sum a_k^2 9^k, which is given to be â¤5. The second term is sum (4/9)^k. That's a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 4/9. So sum_{k=0}^\\infty (4/9)^k = 1 / (1 - 4/9) = 1 / (5/9) = 9/5. 

Therefore, (sum |a_k| 2^k)^2 â¤ 5 * (9/5) = 9. Taking square roots, sum |a_k| 2^k â¤ 3. That's exactly what we needed to prove! So this seems to work. 

Wait, let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't skip anything. First, we set up the Cauchy-Schwarz with b_k = |a_k| 3^k and c_k = (2/3)^k. Then, the product b_k c_k is |a_k| 2^k, which is the sum we want. Then, the square of the sum is â¤ (sum b_k^2)(sum c_k^2). The first sum is indeed sum a_k^2 9^k â¤5. The second sum is sum (4/9)^k = 9/5. Multiplying those gives 9, so square root is 3. Therefore, the inequality holds. 

I think that's a solid proof. Let me check if there's another way to approach this, maybe using HÃ¶lder's inequality or something else, but Cauchy-Schwarz seems straightforward here. HÃ¶lder's inequality generalizes Cauchy-Schwarz, but in this case, since we have two sequences multiplied and summed, Cauchy-Schwarz is sufficient. 

Alternatively, maybe using the HÃ¶lder's inequality with exponents p=2 and q=2, which reduces to Cauchy-Schwarz. So regardless, the approach is valid. 

Another check: suppose all a_k are zero except for some term. For example, if a_0 = sqrt(5/9^0) = sqrt(5), then the sum a_k^2 9^k would be 5. Then the sum |a_k| 2^k would be sqrt(5). But sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, which is less than 3. If we have a_k non-zero at higher k, say a_1 = sqrt(5/9^1) = sqrt(5/9) = sqrt(5)/3 â 0.745. Then the sum |a_k| 2^k would be 0.745 * 2 â 1.49, which is still less than 3. If we spread out the a_k terms, maybe the sum could approach 3. But according to the inequality, it's bounded by 3. So the proof seems to hold. 

Therefore, I think the Cauchy-Schwarz approach is correct here, and the conclusion follows.

","Okay, so I need to prove that if the sum from k=0 to infinity of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, then the sum from k=0 to infinity of |a_k| times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving sums and sequences, it's often useful to apply inequalities like Cauchy-Schwarz or HÃ¶lder's inequality. Let me recall Cauchy-Schwarz. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real sequences {x_k} and {y_k}, the sum of |x_k y_k| is less than or equal to the square root of (sum x_k squared) times (sum y_k squared). 

But wait, in this problem, the given condition is about the sum of a_k squared times 9^k, and we need to bound the sum of |a_k| times 2^k. Maybe I can apply Cauchy-Schwarz here. Let me try to set up the sequences properly.

Let me denote the first sequence as {b_k} where b_k = |a_k|. Then the second sequence could be something that relates 9^k to 2^k. Wait, but 9^k and 2^k are different exponents. Alternatively, maybe I can split the terms in such a way that when I apply Cauchy-Schwarz, the exponents work out.

Alternatively, perhaps HÃ¶lder's inequality is more suitable here. HÃ¶lder's inequality generalizes Cauchy-Schwarz and can handle different exponents. Let me recall HÃ¶lder's inequality. For sequences {x_k} and {y_k}, and exponents p and q such that 1/p + 1/q = 1, the sum |x_k y_k| is less than or equal to (sum |x_k|^p)^{1/p} (sum |y_k|^q)^{1/q}.

In our case, we want to bound the sum of |a_k| 2^k. Let me set x_k = |a_k| and y_k = 2^k. Then, using HÃ¶lder's inequality, we can get a bound. But we need to choose p and q such that the given condition on the sum of a_k squared 9^k is related.

Wait, the given condition is sum a_k^2 9^k <=5. So if I can relate 9^k to 2^k through HÃ¶lder's inequality, maybe by choosing appropriate p and q.

Let me try setting p=2 and q=2. Then HÃ¶lder's inequality would give sum |a_k| 2^k <= sqrt(sum a_k^2) sqrt(sum (2^k)^2). But that doesn't seem helpful because sum (2^k)^2 is sum 4^k, which diverges. So that approach probably won't work.

Alternatively, maybe use a different exponent. Let's see. Let's set up HÃ¶lder's inequality with p such that the term 9^k relates to 2^k. Let me see. Suppose I set x_k = |a_k| and y_k = 2^k. Then HÃ¶lder's inequality would need p and q where 1/p + 1/q = 1. Let me choose p=2 and q=2. Wait, that's the same as Cauchy-Schwarz. But as before, the problem is that sum (2^k)^2 is infinite, so that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe split the sum into two parts and use HÃ¶lder's inequality with different exponents. Alternatively, use Cauchy-Schwarz in a different way. Let me think.

Wait, the given sum is sum a_k^2 9^k <=5. Let me denote c_k = a_k 3^k. Then, sum c_k^2 <=5. So the problem is equivalent to: Given sum c_k^2 <=5, prove that sum |c_k| (2/3)^k <=3.

Ah, that seems more manageable. Because 2/3 is less than 1, so the sum might converge. So we have to prove that sum |c_k| (2/3)^k <=3, given that sum c_k^2 <=5.

Now, to bound sum |c_k| (2/3)^k given that sum c_k^2 <=5. This seems like a classic case where HÃ¶lder's inequality can be applied. Let me set p=2 and q=2, so that HÃ¶lder's inequality gives sum |c_k| (2/3)^k <= sqrt(sum c_k^2) sqrt(sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 ). But wait, this would be sqrt(5) times sqrt(sum (4/9)^k ). But sum (4/9)^k is a geometric series with ratio 4/9, which converges to 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. Therefore, sqrt(5) * sqrt(9/5) = sqrt(5) * (3/sqrt(5)) )=3. So that gives sum |c_k| (2/3)^k <=3, which is exactly what we need. Wait, but hold on. Let me check that again.

Wait, if we use HÃ¶lder's inequality with p=2 and q=2, then sum |c_k| (2/3)^k <= sqrt( sum c_k^2 ) * sqrt( sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 ). The first sqrt is sqrt(5), and the second sqrt is sqrt( sum (4/9)^k ). The sum from k=0 to infinity of (4/9)^k is indeed 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. Therefore, sqrt(9/5) = 3/sqrt(5). Then multiplying sqrt(5) * 3/sqrt(5) gives 3. So this works. Therefore, the inequality holds.

Wait, but let me verify again step by step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Given sum_{k=0}^infty a_k^2 9^k <=5.

Let c_k = a_k 3^k. Then sum c_k^2 = sum a_k^2 9^k <=5.

We need to show sum |a_k| 2^k <=3. Which is equivalent to sum |c_k| (2/3)^k <=3.

Applying HÃ¶lder's inequality with p=2 and q=2:

sum |c_k| (2/3)^k <= sqrt( sum c_k^2 ) * sqrt( sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 )

Compute sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 = sum (4/9)^k. The sum of a geometric series with ratio 4/9 is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. Therefore, sqrt(9/5) = 3/sqrt(5). Then sqrt(5) * 3/sqrt(5) =3. So the inequality holds. Therefore, the original inequality is proven.

Wait, but let me check if HÃ¶lder's inequality applies here. HÃ¶lder's inequality requires that the sequences are in L^p and L^q spaces, but since we are dealing with sequences, and the sums are finite (since the given sum is <=5 and the sum (4/9)^k converges), then it's valid. So the steps seem correct.

Alternatively, using Cauchy-Schwarz directly on the original variables. Let's see:

sum |a_k| 2^k <= sqrt( sum a_k^2 9^k ) * sqrt( sum (2^k / 3^k )^2 )

Wait, but that's the same as above. Because 2^k /3^k = (2/3)^k, so squared is (4/9)^k. So same result. Therefore, this approach works.

Therefore, the proof is complete. The key was to recognize that by defining c_k = a_k 3^k, we can relate the given sum to the sum of c_k^2, and then apply HÃ¶lder's (or Cauchy-Schwarz) inequality with the appropriate weights. This clever substitution transforms the problem into a more standard form where the inequality is straightforward to apply.

Given that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{k}^{2}9^{k} \\le 5 \\), we need to prove that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le 3 \\).

We apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real sequences \\( \\{b_k\\} \\) and \\( \\{c_k\\} \\),

\\[
\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |b_k c_k| \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty b_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty c_k^2 \\right).
\\]

We express \\( |a_k| 2^k \\) as the product of \\( |a_k| 3^k \\) and \\( (2/3)^k \\). Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( |a_k| 3^k ) ( (2/3)^k ) \\leq \\sqrt{ \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( |a_k| 3^k )^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( (2/3)^k )^2 \\right) }.

Combining these results:

","Okay, let's see. I need to prove that if the sum from k=0 to infinity of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, then the sum from k=0 to infinity of the absolute value of a_k times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, so the problem is about relating two different series involving the coefficients a_k. 

First, I need to recall some inequalities that might connect these two sums. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality comes to mind. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any two sequences {b_k} and {c_k}, the sum of |b_k c_k| is less than or equal to the square root of (sum of b_k squared times sum of c_k squared). Maybe I can apply that here.

Let me write down the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for sequences:

\\[
\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |b_k c_k| \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty b_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty c_k^2 \\right)
\\]

So if I can express the sum we want to bound, which is \\(\\sum |a_k|2^k\\), as a product of two sequences where one is related to the given sum \\(\\sum a_k^2 9^k\\), then maybe Cauchy-Schwarz can help.

Let's think about how to write \\(|a_k|2^k\\) as a product of two terms. Let's set \\(b_k = |a_k| \\sqrt{9^k}\\) and \\(c_k = \\frac{2^k}{\\sqrt{9^k}}\\). Then, the product \\(b_k c_k\\) would be \\(|a_k| \\sqrt{9^k} \\times \\frac{2^k}{\\sqrt{9^k}} = |a_k| 2^k\\), which is exactly the term we have in the sum we need to bound.

So then, applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\\[
\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (|a_k| \\sqrt{9^k})^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2^k}{\\sqrt{9^k}} \\right)^2 \\right)
\\]

Simplifying each term:

The first sum on the right-hand side is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k^2 9^k\\), which is given to be at most 5. So that part is good.

The second sum is \\(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{4^k}{9^k}\\). Let's compute that sum. That's a geometric series with common ratio \\( \\frac{4}{9} \\), so the sum from k=0 to infinity is \\(\\frac{1}{1 - \\frac{4}{9}} = \\frac{1}{\\frac{5}{9}} = \\frac{9}{5}\\).

So putting it all together:

\\[
\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k \\right)^2 \\leq 5 \\times \\frac{9}{5} = 9
\\]

Taking square roots on both sides:

\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k \\leq 3
\\]

Which is exactly what we needed to prove. Wait, but the problem mentions ""prove that \\( \\sum |a_k|2^k \\le \\frac{2}{3} \\)"". Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the user wrote ""prove that \\( \\sum |a_k|2^k \\le \\frac{2}{3} \\)"", but in the initial problem statement, the user wrote ""Given that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{k}^{2}9^{k} \\le 5 \\), prove that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le 3 \\).\\frac{2}{3}$"". Hmm, maybe there's a typo here. Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote: ""Given that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{k}^{2}9^{k} \\le 5 \\), prove that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le 3 \\).\\frac{2}{3}$"". So maybe the user intended to write \\( \\le 3 \\frac{2}{3} \\), which is 3.666..., but that's not the case here. Wait, maybe there's a formatting issue. Let me check again.

Wait, the original problem says: ""prove that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le \\frac{2}{3} \\)"". Wait, but the user wrote: ""prove that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le 3 \\).\\frac{2}{3}$"". So maybe the user made a typo. Let's check both possibilities.

If the problem is to prove that the sum is less than or equal to 3, then the Cauchy-Schwarz approach works, as above, giving 3. If the problem is to prove that the sum is less than or equal to 2/3, then my approach gives 3, which is larger, so that would not work. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. But given that the user wrote ""prove that \\( \\sum |a_k|2^k \\le 3 \\).\\frac{2}{3}$"", maybe it's a typo, and the correct upper bound is 3. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was to prove that the sum is less than or equal to 2/3, but the given condition is different. But according to the user's message, the condition is \\( \\sum a_k^2 9^k \\le 5 \\), and the conclusion is \\( \\sum |a_k|2^k \\le 3 \\). So perhaps the user made a typo in the final part, putting .\\frac{2}{3}$ instead of \\le 3. So assuming the problem is correct as stated, the answer is 3. Let me confirm once again.

If the problem is to prove that \\( \\sum |a_k|2^k \\le 3 \\), given that \\( \\sum a_k^2 9^k \\le 5 \\), then the Cauchy-Schwarz approach works. The steps are:

1. Express \\( |a_k|2^k \\) as \\( |a_k| \\sqrt{9^k} \\times \\frac{2^k}{\\sqrt{9^k}} \\).
2. Apply Cauchy-Schwarz to get the square of the sum is less than or equal to the product of the two sums.
3. The first sum is \\( \\sum a_k^2 9^k \\le 5 \\).
4. The second sum is \\( \\sum (4/9)^k = 9/5 \\).
5. Multiply 5 and 9/5 to get 9, take square roots to get 3.

Therefore, the conclusion is correct. So maybe the user had a typo in the problem statement, putting .\\frac{2}{3}$ instead of \\le 3. Therefore, the correct answer is 3, and the proof is as above.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another approach. For example, maybe using HÃ¶lder's inequality or another method. HÃ¶lder's inequality generalizes Cauchy-Schwarz and states that for p and q conjugate exponents (1/p + 1/q = 1), the sum |a_k b_k| is less than or equal to ||a||_p ||b||_q. If we take p=2 and q=2, that's the Cauchy-Schwarz case. Alternatively, maybe using p=1 and q=infinity, but that might not help here. Alternatively, maybe using different exponents.

Alternatively, we can use the AM-GM inequality. Let's think: if we have a_k^2 9^k and we want to bound |a_k| 2^k. Let's see, for each term, 2^k |a_k| is the term we want to bound. Let's relate this to a_k^2 9^k.

If we use AM-GM on |a_k| and 2^k, but perhaps not directly. Alternatively, consider for each term:

We can write 2^k |a_k| = 2^k |a_k|. Let's see, if we have a_k^2 9^k, then |a_k| = (a_k^2)^{1/2}. So perhaps using HÃ¶lder's inequality with exponents p=2 and q=2. Wait, that's the same as Cauchy-Schwarz.

Alternatively, think of each term |a_k| 2^k as a product of |a_k| and 2^k. If we can bound |a_k| by something involving 9^k, then 2^k would be another factor. But since we have the sum of a_k^2 9^k, maybe using Cauchy-Schwarz is the way to go.

Alternatively, think of the sum we want to bound as the L^2 inner product of the sequence |a_k| with the sequence 2^k. Then by Cauchy-Schwarz, that inner product is less than or equal to the product of the L^2 norms. The L^2 norm of |a_k| is sqrt(sum a_k^2 9^k), and the L^2 norm of 2^k is sqrt(sum 4^k). Wait, but this is similar to the previous approach. Wait, but actually, if we take the sum |a_k|2^k, then it's the inner product of |a_k| and 2^k. Then by Cauchy-Schwarz:

sum |a_k|2^k <= sqrt( sum |a_k|^2 ) * sqrt( sum 4^k )

But wait, but in this case, the given sum is sum a_k^2 9^k <=5. So if we can relate sum |a_k|^2 to sum a_k^2 9^k, but they are different. So maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps use HÃ¶lder with exponents p=2 and q=2, but that's the same as Cauchy-Schwarz.

Alternatively, maybe use the HÃ¶lder inequality with exponents p=3 and q=3/2 or something, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality but with different weights. For example, if we let b_k = |a_k| and c_k = 2^k, then sum |b_k c_k| <= sqrt( sum b_k^2 / 9^k ) * sqrt( sum c_k^2 * 9^k ). Wait, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe use weighted Cauchy-Schwarz.

Alternatively, think of |a_k|2^k = |a_k| * 2^k. Let me express 2^k as (2/3)^k * 3^k. Then |a_k|2^k = |a_k|3^k * (2/3)^k. Then, applying Cauchy-Schwarz:

sum |a_k|2^k = sum (|a_k|3^k)( (2/3)^k ) <= sqrt( sum (|a_k|3^k)^2 ) * sqrt( sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 )

Compute each part:

First sum: sum (|a_k|3^k)^2 = sum a_k^2 9^k <=5

Second sum: sum (4/9)^k = 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5

Therefore, the product is sqrt(5) * sqrt(9/5) = sqrt(5 * 9/5) = sqrt(9) = 3. So same result. So that's another way to write it.

Therefore, regardless of how I approach it, using Cauchy-Schwarz in different ways, I end up with 3. So unless there's a different inequality or approach, this seems to be the correct upper bound.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the sum is less than or equal to 3. The problem statement might have a typo, but based on the given condition and the correct application of Cauchy-Schwarz, the answer is 3. So the final answer should be \\boxed{3}.

","Okay, so I need to prove that if the sum from k=0 to infinity of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, then the sum from k=0 to infinity of |a_k| times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, let's see. Alright, maybe I can use some inequality here. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality comes to mind. Let me recall that. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real sequences {b_k} and {c_k}, the sum of |b_k c_k| is less than or equal to the square root of (sum of b_k squared) times the square root of (sum of c_k squared). So, maybe I can apply that here.

In this case, the left-hand side of the desired inequality is the sum of |a_k| times 2^k. Let me try to express that as a product of two sequences. If I set b_k = |a_k| and c_k = 2^k, then the sum is the sum of b_k c_k. But wait, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality would give me that this sum is less than or equal to the square root of (sum of b_k squared) times the square root of (sum of c_k squared). The sum of b_k squared is the sum of a_k squared, which is given here as sum of a_k squared times 9^k, but that seems different. Wait, no. Wait, the given condition is sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k^2 9^k â¤ 5. So, if I can relate the sum of a_k squared to that, maybe I need to adjust.

Alternatively, maybe I can manipulate the given condition. Let's see. The given condition is sum_{k=0}^\\infty (a_k^2) 9^k â¤ 5. If I factor out 9^k, then a_k^2 â¤ 5 / 9^k, but that might not be helpful. Wait, maybe I can rewrite the sum as sum_{k=0}^\\infty (a_k * 3^k)^2 â¤ 5. Because a_k^2 * 9^k = (a_k * 3^k)^2. So, the sum of (a_k * 3^k)^2 is â¤ 5. That might be a useful way to think about it. So, the sequence {a_k * 3^k} has its squared terms summed to at most 5.

Now, the sum we need to bound is sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k. Let's try to express |a_k| 2^k in terms of the given sequences. Let me see. If I consider |a_k| 2^k = |a_k * 3^k| * (2/3)^k. Because |a_k| 2^k = |a_k * 3^k| * (2^k / 3^k) = |a_k * 3^k| * (2/3)^k. So, that's the product of two sequences: |a_k * 3^k| and (2/3)^k. Then, applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to these two sequences. Let me check:

By Cauchy-Schwarz, sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k * 3^k| * (2/3)^k â¤ sqrt( sum_{k=0}^\\infty (|a_k * 3^k|)^2 ) * sqrt( sum_{k=0}^\\infty (2/3)^{2k} )

We know the first sum is sum_{k=0}^\\infty (a_k^2 * 9^k) which is given to be â¤5. The second sum is sum_{k=0}^\\infty (4/9)^k. That's a geometric series with ratio 4/9, so sum_{k=0}^\\infty (4/9)^k = 1 / (1 - 4/9) = 1 / (5/9) = 9/5. Therefore, the second sqrt is sqrt(9/5). So, putting it all together:

sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k â¤ sqrt(5) * sqrt(9/5) = sqrt(5) * (3 / sqrt(5)) ) = 3. So, that gives the desired result. Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify again.

We start by expressing |a_k| 2^k as |a_k * 3^k| * (2/3)^k. Then apply Cauchy-Schwarz to these two sequences. The first sequence squared is |a_k * 3^k|^2 = a_k^2 * 9^k, which sums to â¤5. The second sequence is (2/3)^k, whose square is (4/9)^k, and the sum of that is 9/5. So sqrt(5) * sqrt(9/5) = sqrt(5 * 9/5) = sqrt(9) = 3. So yes, that works. Therefore, the conclusion is that the sum is â¤3. Therefore, the proof is complete.

But let me check if all the steps are valid. The key step was expressing |a_k| 2^k as |a_k * 3^k| * (2/3)^k. That's correct because 2^k / 3^k = (2/3)^k. Then, applying Cauchy-Schwarz. The sequences are |a_k * 3^k| and (2/3)^k. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality applies to any real sequences, so that's fine. Then, evaluating the sums. The first sum is indeed the given sum, and the second sum is a geometric series. The calculation of the geometric series: sum_{k=0}^\\infty (4/9)^k. Since |4/9| <1, the sum is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. Correct. Then sqrt(5) * sqrt(9/5) = 3. So all steps check out. Therefore, the proof is valid.

I don't see any mistakes here. The key idea was to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality by appropriately choosing the sequences to relate the given condition to the desired inequality. This approach seems solid. Therefore, the conclusion that the sum is â¤3 is correct.

Given that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{k}^{2}9^{k} \\le 5 \\), we need to prove that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le 3 \\).

We apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real sequences \\( \\{b_k\\} \\) and \\( \\{c_k\\} \\),

\\[
\\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |b_k c_k| \\right)^2 \\leq \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty b_k^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty c_k^2 \\right).
\\]

We express \\( |a_k| 2^k \\) as the product of \\( |a_k| 3^k \\) and \\( (2/3)^k \\). Applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:

\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( |a_k| 3^k ) ( (2/3)^k ) \\leq \\sqrt{ \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( |a_k| 3^k )^2 \\right) \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty ( (2/3)^k )^2 \\right) }.
\\]

Simplifying the terms inside the square roots, we have:

1. The first sum is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k^2 9^k \\), which is given to be at most 5.
2. The second sum is a geometric series with ratio \\( (4/9) \\):

\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (4/9)^k = \\frac{1}{1 - 4/9} = \\frac{9}{5}.

Combining these results:

\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty |a_k| 2^k \\leq \\sqrt{ 5 \\times \\frac{9}{5} } = \\sqrt{9} = 3.

Thus, we conclude that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le 3 \\).

","Okay, let's see. I need to prove that if the sum of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, then the sum of |a_k| times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm. Alright, so we have two different series here. The first one is involving 9^k, and the second one is with 2^k. Both are infinite series starting from k=0. The coefficients are the same in both, but they are squared in the first sum and just absolute values in the second. 

I remember that when dealing with inequalities between series, especially involving different coefficients, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality might be useful. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any real sequences {b_k} and {c_k}, the following holds:

(Î£ |b_k c_k| )Â² â¤ (Î£ b_kÂ²)(Î£ c_kÂ²)

Maybe I can apply this here. Let me think. If I set b_k = a_k and c_k = something involving 9^k and 2^k. Wait, but the given sum is Î£ a_kÂ² 9^k â¤ 5. The target is Î£ |a_k| 2^k â¤ 3. So perhaps I can relate the two sums using Cauchy-Schwarz.

Let me try to express the target sum as a product of two sequences. Let's see, |a_k| 2^k can be written as |a_k| * (2/3)^k * 3^k. Wait, hold on. Let me check that:

2^k = (2/3)^k * 3^k. Yes, because (2/3)^k * 3^k = 2^k. So then, |a_k| 2^k = |a_k| * 3^k * (2/3)^k. Therefore, the sum Î£ |a_k| 2^k = Î£ |a_k| 3^k (2/3)^k.

So if I let b_k = |a_k| 3^k and c_k = (2/3)^k, then the sum Î£ |a_k| 2^k = Î£ b_k c_k. Then by Cauchy-Schwarz, this is â¤ sqrt(Î£ b_kÂ² Î£ c_kÂ²).

But let's verify this. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives (Î£ b_k c_k )Â² â¤ (Î£ b_kÂ²)(Î£ c_kÂ²). Therefore, Î£ b_k c_k â¤ sqrt( (Î£ b_kÂ²)(Î£ c_kÂ²) ). So, if I can compute Î£ b_kÂ² and Î£ c_kÂ², then I can get an upper bound.

Given that b_k = |a_k| 3^k, then b_kÂ² = a_kÂ² 9^k. So Î£ b_kÂ² = Î£ a_kÂ² 9^k, which is given to be â¤ 5. Then Î£ c_kÂ² = Î£ ( (2/3)^k )Â² = Î£ (4/9)^k. That's a geometric series with ratio 4/9. The sum of a geometric series starting at k=0 is 1/(1 - r) when |r| < 1. So here, r = 4/9, so the sum is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 1/(5/9) = 9/5.

Therefore, Î£ c_kÂ² = 9/5. So putting it all together:

Î£ |a_k| 2^k â¤ sqrt(5 * 9/5) = sqrt(9) = 3.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check each step again.

First, we set b_k = |a_k| 3^k and c_k = (2/3)^k. Then the original sum Î£ |a_k| 2^k becomes Î£ b_k c_k. Then Cauchy-Schwarz gives us that this is â¤ sqrt( Î£ b_kÂ² Î£ c_kÂ² ). 

Î£ b_kÂ² is Î£ (|a_k| 3^k )Â² = Î£ a_kÂ² 9^k, which is â¤5. Î£ c_kÂ² = Î£ (4/9)^k = 9/5. So multiplying these gives 5*(9/5) =9. Taking the square root gives 3. Therefore, the inequality holds. So the sum is â¤3. Therefore, the desired result is proven.

Wait, but let me confirm. The problem states that the sum is â¤3, and according to this, it's exactly 3. But the problem says ""prove that the sum is â¤3"". Since we have an upper bound of 3, that's exactly what we need. So even if the actual sum is less than 3, the inequality still holds. Therefore, this should be sufficient.

But let me check if there's any assumption I missed. For example, is the convergence of the series guaranteed? The problem states that the sums are given, so we can assume that they converge. Also, the use of Cauchy-Schwarz here is valid because both series are convergent, so the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality applies.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's think about HÃ¶lder's inequality or something else. But Cauchy-Schwarz seems the most straightforward here.

Another approach: Maybe using the AM-GM inequality. Let's see. For each term |a_k| 2^k, perhaps relate it to a_kÂ² 9^k. Let me see:

We can write |a_k| 2^k = |a_k| (2/3)^k 3^k. Then, using AM-GM on |a_k| and 3^k. Wait, but AM-GM is for non-negative numbers. Since |a_k| is non-negative, and 3^k is positive, maybe we can bound |a_k| 3^k using a combination of a_kÂ² 9^k and something else.

Wait, but Cauchy-Schwarz seems more direct here. Let me recap:

Î£ |a_k| 2^k = Î£ |a_k| 3^k (2/3)^k.

Let me denote x_k = |a_k| 3^k and y_k = (2/3)^k. Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz:

(Î£ x_k y_k )Â² â¤ (Î£ x_kÂ²)(Î£ y_kÂ² )

So, Î£ x_k y_k â¤ sqrt( (Î£ x_kÂ²)(Î£ y_kÂ² ) )

But x_kÂ² = (|a_k| 3^k )Â² = a_kÂ² 9^k. So Î£ x_kÂ² = Î£ a_kÂ² 9^k â¤5.

Î£ y_kÂ² = Î£ (4/9)^k = 9/5.

Thus, Î£ x_k y_k â¤ sqrt(5 * (9/5)) = sqrt(9) =3.

Therefore, Î£ |a_k| 2^k â¤3. So that's the same result. Therefore, the inequality holds.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz in another way. Let's suppose we set up the sum Î£ |a_k| 2^k as the inner product of two vectors. Let me think, but the previous approach seems sufficient.

Is there a case where equality holds? For Cauchy-Schwarz, equality holds when the vectors are proportional. That is, when x_k = Î» y_k for some constant Î». So here, |a_k| 3^k = Î» (2/3)^k. Which implies |a_k| = Î» (2/3)^k / 3^k = Î» (2/9)^k. So if a_k is proportional to (2/9)^k, then equality would hold. But in our case, the sum Î£ a_kÂ² 9^k is given to be â¤5. Let's check if in the case of equality, the sum would be exactly 5. Let's take a_k = Î» (2/9)^k. Then a_kÂ² 9^k = Î»Â² (4/81)^k * 9^k = Î»Â² (4/9)^k. Then the sum Î£ a_kÂ² 9^k = Î»Â² Î£ (4/9)^k = Î»Â² * (1/(1 - 4/9)) = Î»Â² * 9/5. If this is equal to 5, then Î»Â² = (5)*5/9 =25/9, so Î»=5/3. Then the sum Î£ |a_k| 2^k would be Î£ (5/3)(2/9)^k * 2^k = (5/3) Î£ (2/9)^k *2^k = (5/3) Î£ (4/9)^k = (5/3)*(9/5)=3. So indeed, equality holds when a_k is proportional to (2/9)^k. Therefore, this is the case when the inequality becomes equality. However, the problem states that the sum is â¤5, so the maximum possible value of the other sum is 3. Hence, proven.

Therefore, the answer should be 3, and the steps above hold. I think this is correct. The key was to express the target sum in terms of a product of two sequences and then apply Cauchy-Schwarz to relate it to the given sum and the geometric series sum. All the steps check out, and the calculations are correct.

","Okay, so I need to prove that if the sum from k=0 to infinity of |a_k| times 2^k is less than or equal to 3, then the sum from k=0 to infinity of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5. Hmm, wait, actually, let me check again. The problem says: Given that the sum of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, prove that the sum of |a_k| times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, so it's the other way around. So the given is the sum of a_kÂ² 9^k â¤ 5, and we need to show that the sum of |a_k| 2^k â¤ 3. 

Alright, so I need to relate these two series. The problem gives a bound on the sum of squares multiplied by 9^k, and we need to bound the sum of absolute values multiplied by 2^k. This seems like a case where I can apply some inequality, maybe Cauchy-Schwarz or HÃ¶lder's inequality. Let me recall Cauchy-Schwarz: for sequences {b_k} and {c_k}, (sum |b_k c_k|)^2 â¤ (sum b_kÂ²)(sum c_kÂ²). But here, the terms are different. Let's see.

If I think of the sum sum |a_k| 2^k as the inner product of two sequences, say { |a_k| } and { 2^k }, but Cauchy-Schwarz would give (sum |a_k| 2^k)^2 â¤ (sum |a_k|Â²)(sum 4^k). But the problem gives a bound on sum a_kÂ² 9^k, not on sum a_kÂ². So maybe that approach isn't directly helpful.

Alternatively, maybe HÃ¶lder's inequality? HÃ¶lder's inequality generalizes Cauchy-Schwarz and relates different exponents. It states that for conjugate exponents p and q (1/p + 1/q = 1), sum |f_k g_k| â¤ ||f||_p ||g||_q. So if I can express the sum sum |a_k| 2^k as such a product. Let's see. If I set f_k = |a_k| and g_k = 2^k. Then HÃ¶lder's inequality would say (sum |a_k| 2^k)^p â¤ (sum |a_k|^p)^{q/p} (sum (2^k)^q)^{1/q} }, but I need to choose p and q such that this relates to the given condition. 

Alternatively, perhaps using Cauchy-Schwarz with appropriate weights. Let me think. If I take the sum of |a_k| 2^k, I can write this as sum |a_k| 2^k = sum |a_k| 3^k (2/3)^k. Then maybe apply Cauchy-Schwarz here. Let's try that:

(sum |a_k| 2^k)^2 â¤ (sum |a_k|Â² 9^k)(sum ( (2/3)^k )Â² )

So that's (sum |a_k| 2^k)^2 â¤ (sum a_kÂ² 9^k)(sum (4/9)^k )

We know that the first term on the right is â¤5, and the second term is a geometric series. Let's compute sum_{k=0}^â (4/9)^k. The sum of a geometric series with ratio 4/9 is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. So the second sum is 9/5. Therefore, putting it all together:

(sum |a_k| 2^k)^2 â¤ 5 * (9/5) = 9

Therefore, taking square roots, sum |a_k| 2^k â¤ 3. Which is exactly what we needed to prove. So that works. 

Wait, let me check again. So by Cauchy-Schwarz, (sum |a_k| 2^k)^2 â¤ (sum |a_k|Â² 9^k)(sum ( (2/3)^k )Â² ). The first sum is given as â¤5, and the second sum is sum (4/9)^k = 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. Multiplying 5 and 9/5 gives 9, so the square of the desired sum is â¤9, hence the sum is â¤3. Perfect, that seems to do it. 

But let me just verify each step to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

1. Expressing sum |a_k| 2^k as sum |a_k| 3^k (2/3)^k. That's correct, since 2^k = (2/3)^k * 3^k. 

2. Applying Cauchy-Schwarz: (sum |b_k c_k|)^2 â¤ (sum b_kÂ²)(sum c_kÂ²). Here, b_k = |a_k| 3^k and c_k = (2/3)^k. Then yes, the squares would be |a_k|Â² 9^k and (4/9)^k. 

3. The sum |a_k|Â² 9^k is given to be â¤5. The sum (4/9)^k is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. Multiplying 5 and 9/5 gives 9. Taking square roots gives 3. 

All steps check out. So the key was to rewrite the sum |a_k|2^k as a product of |a_k|3^k and (2/3)^k, then apply Cauchy-Schwarz with those terms. That allowed us to relate the given condition on the sum of a_kÂ²9^k to the desired bound on the sum of |a_k|2^k. 

I don't think I missed anything here. The crucial step was recognizing how to decompose the sum into two parts that fit the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, and computing the geometric series sum correctly. Since both parts are checked, the conclusion holds.

","Okay, so I need to prove that if the sum from k=0 to infinity of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, then the sum from k=0 to infinity of the absolute value of a_k times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, let's see. 

First, I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving sums and squares, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is often useful. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that for any two sequences of real numbers {b_k} and {c_k}, the square of the sum of the products is less than or equal to the product of the sum of the squares of each sequence. In symbols, (sum |b_k c_k|)^2 â¤ (sum b_k^2)(sum c_k^2). Maybe I can apply this here.

Looking at the given condition: sum (a_k^2 9^k) â¤ 5. The target is to show that sum |a_k| 2^k â¤ 3. So, perhaps I can express the target sum in terms of the given condition. Let me think. If I set b_k = |a_k| and c_k = 2^k, then the sum we want to bound is sum |a_k| 2^k = sum b_k c_k. Applying Cauchy-Schwarz would give (sum b_k c_k)^2 â¤ (sum b_k^2)(sum c_k^2). But wait, sum b_k^2 is sum a_k^2, which is part of the given condition, but the given condition has 9^k multiplied in. Hmm, maybe I need to adjust the terms to match.

Alternatively, maybe I can set b_k = a_k * 3^k and c_k = (2/3)^k. Then, the product b_k c_k would be a_k * 3^k * (2/3)^k = a_k * 2^k. Then, sum |a_k| 2^k = sum |a_k| 2^k = sum |b_k c_k|. Then, applying Cauchy-Schwarz, (sum |b_k c_k|)^2 â¤ (sum |b_k|^2)(sum |c_k|^2). Let's compute each part.

First, sum |b_k|^2 = sum (a_k^2 9^k) which is given to be â¤ 5. Then, sum |c_k|^2 = sum (4/9)^k. That's a geometric series with ratio 4/9. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to infinity is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 1/(5/9) = 9/5. So, sum |c_k|^2 = 9/5. Therefore, putting it all together, (sum |a_k| 2^k)^2 â¤ 5 * (9/5) = 9. Taking square roots, sum |a_k| 2^k â¤ 3. That seems to work! Let me check if I did everything correctly.

Wait, let me verify the choice of b_k and c_k again. If I set b_k = a_k * 3^k, then |b_k| = |a_k| 3^k. Then, c_k = (2/3)^k. Then, |b_k c_k| = |a_k| 3^k * (2/3)^k = |a_k| 2^k, which is exactly the term in the sum we want to bound. So, Cauchy-Schwarz gives the square of the sum of |a_k| 2^k is â¤ (sum a_k^2 9^k)(sum (4/9)^k). The first sum is â¤5, the second sum is 9/5. So, 5*(9/5)=9, square root is 3. Therefore, the desired inequality holds. That seems solid. 

But just to make sure there's no mistake, let me think of another approach. Maybe using HÃ¶lder's inequality? HÃ¶lder is a generalization of Cauchy-Schwarz. For p and q such that 1/p + 1/q = 1, we have sum |b_k c_k| â¤ (sum |b_k|^p)^{1/p} (sum |c_k|^q)^{1/q}. If we take p=2 and q=2, that's Cauchy-Schwarz again. So, same result. 

Alternatively, maybe using the AM-QM inequality? But that might not directly apply here. Let's see. The sum |a_k| 2^k is like the L1 norm of a_k times 2^k, and the given condition is the L2 norm of a_k times 3^k squared. So, to relate L1 and L2 norms, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which essentially says that the L1 norm is â¤ the L2 norm times the L2 norm of the other sequence. Wait, maybe that's similar to what I did earlier.

Alternatively, think of the sum |a_k| 2^k as the inner product of (|a_k|, 2^k) but in sequence space. Wait, perhaps not. The Cauchy-Schwarz approach still seems the most straightforward here. 

Wait, another thought: maybe use HÃ¶lder's inequality with different exponents. Let's see. Suppose I take p=2 and q=2, which gives the Cauchy-Schwarz case. If I take p=1 and q=infinity, then sum |b_k c_k| â¤ ||b_k||_1 ||c_k||_{infty}. But in this case, I don't think that helps because we don't have a bound on the individual terms. The given condition is on the L2 norm, not L1. So HÃ¶lder with p=2 and q=2 is the right choice here. 

Alternatively, maybe using the inequality between arithmetic and geometric means? But I don't see a direct application here. Let me check again the steps:

1. Express the target sum as the sum |a_k| 2^k.
2. Recognize that this is the sum |a_k| 3^k * (2/3)^k.
3. Apply Cauchy-Schwarz to these two sequences: |a_k| 3^k and (2/3)^k.
4. The first sequence squared sum is sum a_k^2 9^k â¤5.
5. The second sequence squared sum is sum (4/9)^k = 9/5.
6. Multiply the two sums: 5 * (9/5) =9.
7. Take square root: sqrt(9)=3. Hence, the target sum is â¤3.

Yes, that seems correct. Let me check if there's any possible mistake in the algebra. The sum of (4/9)^k from k=0 to infinity is indeed 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. Correct. Then 5*(9/5)=9. Square root is 3. All steps check out.

Another way to think about it: the given condition is that the L2 norm of a_k with weights 3^k is at most sqrt(5). Then, the target is the L1 norm of a_k with weights 2^k. Since 2^k = (2/3)^k * 3^k, the L1 norm can be written as the sum |a_k| (2/3)^k 3^k. Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz, this is â¤ sqrt( sum a_k^2 9^k ) * sqrt( sum (4/9)^k ). Which is sqrt(5) * sqrt(9/5) = sqrt(5) * (3/sqrt(5)) )=3. So same result.

Therefore, the proof is valid. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. It seems that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is the key here, appropriately applied by splitting the term 2^k into (2/3)^k * 3^k. This allows us to relate the given L2 norm condition to the desired L1 norm via the inequality.

Given that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{k}^{2}9^{k} \\le 5 \\), we need to prove that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le 3 \\).

We apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real sequences \\( \\{b_k\\} \\) and \\( \\{c_k\\} \\),

\\[

","Okay, let's see. I need to prove that if the sum from k=0 to infinity of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, then the sum from k=0 to infinity of |a_k| times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, how do I approach this?

Alright, so the given condition is that the series âa_kÂ²9^k â¤ 5, and we need to show that â|a_k|2^k â¤ 3. Both of these are infinite series involving coefficients a_k. The first one has a square of a_k multiplied by 9^k, and the second one has the absolute value of a_k multiplied by 2^k. 

This seems like a problem that might involve inequalities between different types of series. Maybe Cauchy-Schwarz? Because Cauchy-Schwarz relates the product of two sequences to the sum of their squares. Let me recall: for any real sequences {b_k} and {c_k}, we have (sum |b_k c_k|)Â² â¤ (sum b_kÂ²)(sum c_kÂ²). So if I can set up b_k and c_k such that their product relates to |a_k|2^k, then maybe I can use the given condition to bound the second sum.

Let me try to set b_k = |a_k| and c_k = 2^k. Then sum |b_k c_k| would be sum |a_k|2^k, which is exactly the left-hand side of the inequality we need to prove. According to Cauchy-Schwarz, (sum |a_k|2^k)Â² â¤ (sum (|a_k|)Â²)(sum (2^k)Â²). Wait, but the given condition is sum (a_kÂ²)9^k â¤ 5. So if I can relate sum (|a_k|Â²) to sum (a_kÂ²)9^k, maybe through a scaling factor?

Wait, sum (|a_k|Â²) is the same as sum (a_kÂ²), which is part of the given condition. But the given condition has 9^k multiplied by a_kÂ². So sum a_kÂ²9^k â¤ 5. If I can express sum a_kÂ² as (sum a_kÂ²9^k) multiplied by something. Hmm, maybe not directly. Alternatively, perhaps I need to adjust the Cauchy-Schwarz approach by scaling the coefficients.

Let me think. Suppose I write |a_k|2^k as |a_k|3^k * (2/3)^k. Then, the sum over k of |a_k|2^k would be sum |a_k|3^k*(2/3)^k. Then, applying Cauchy-Schwarz, sum |b_k c_k| â¤ sqrt(sum b_kÂ² sum c_kÂ²), where b_k = |a_k|3^k and c_k = (2/3)^k. Then, sum |a_k|3^k*(2/3)^k â¤ sqrt( sum (a_kÂ²9^k) * sum ((2/3)^{2k}) )

But the given condition is sum a_kÂ²9^k â¤ 5, so sum (a_kÂ²9^k) â¤5. Then the first term under the square root is 5. The second term is sum (4/9)^k. That's a geometric series with ratio 4/9. The sum from k=0 to infinity of (4/9)^k is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. Therefore, the entire expression would be sqrt(5 * (9/5)) = sqrt(9) = 3. Therefore, sum |a_k|2^k â¤3. That's exactly the result we need! So that works. Let me check again step by step.

So we have sum |a_k|2^k. Let's factor out 3^k and 2/3. So |a_k|2^k = |a_k|3^k * (2/3)^k. Then, applying Cauchy-Schwarz: sum |a_k|3^k*(2/3)^k â¤ sqrt( sum (a_kÂ²9^k) * sum ((2/3)^{2k}) )

We know sum a_kÂ²9^k â¤5, and sum (4/9)^k is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. So sqrt(5 * 9/5) = sqrt(9) =3. Therefore, the inequality holds. Therefore, the sum |a_k|2^k â¤3. 

Wait, but let me verify each step carefully. First, the Cauchy-Schwarz application. The product |a_k|3^k*(2/3)^k is equal to |a_k|2^k, which is correct. Then, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality says that the sum of the products is less than or equal to the square root of the product of the sums. Then, the sum of (|a_k|3^k)^2 is sum a_kÂ²9^k, which is given to be â¤5. The sum of ((2/3)^k)^2 is sum (4/9)^k, which is a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 4/9. Since |4/9| <1, the sum converges to 1/(1 -4/9)=9/5. Therefore, multiplying the two sums gives 5*(9/5)=9, and the square root of 9 is 3. So yes, this seems correct.

Therefore, the proof is complete. The key step was to apply Cauchy-Schwarz with the appropriate scaling factors to relate the two sums. By expressing |a_k|2^k as a product involving 3^k and (2/3)^k, we could leverage the given condition on the sum with 9^k. This problem is a classic example of using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to bridge different weighted sums of sequences.

Let me just check if there's another approach. Maybe using HÃ¶lder's inequality? HÃ¶lder's is a generalization of Cauchy-Schwarz and might work here as well. HÃ¶lder's inequality states that for conjugate exponents p and q (1/p +1/q =1), sum |f_k g_k| â¤ (sum |f_k|^p)^{1/p} (sum |g_k|^q)^{1/q}. If we take p=2 and q=2, we get the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality again. So in this case, the approach we took is indeed the Cauchy-Schwarz one. Alternatively, maybe using HÃ¶lder with different exponents? Let me think. Suppose we take p=2 and q=2, same as before. So that's the same result. So HÃ¶lder doesn't give us anything new here. 

Alternatively, maybe using the AM-QM inequality or something else. But Cauchy-Schwarz seems the most straightforward here. Another way to think about it is to bound each term |a_k|2^k using the given condition. For example, using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality for each term: |a_k|2^k â¤ C (a_kÂ²9^k + D), but I don't think that would work because it's not linear. Alternatively, maybe using the inequality |a_k| â¤ sqrt(a_kÂ²), but that might not help directly. The Cauchy-Schwarz approach seems the most effective here.

Therefore, I feel confident that the proof is correct. The steps are as follows:

1. Express |a_k|2^k as |a_k|3^k * (2/3)^k.
2. Apply Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to separate the sums.
3. Use the given condition sum a_kÂ²9^k â¤5.
4. Compute the sum of the squares of (2/3)^k, which is a geometric series.
5. Multiply the two sums and take the square root to get 3.
6. Conclude that the original sum is â¤3.

All steps check out, and the reasoning is sound. No obvious errors in the calculations. The key insight was the factorization of 2^k into 3^k*(2/3)^k to apply Cauchy-Schwarz, which allows us to relate the two different weighted sums of the coefficients. This problem is a good example of how to manipulate inequalities and use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in practice.

","Okay, so I need to prove that if the sum of a_k squared times 9^k up to infinity is less than or equal to 5, then the sum of the absolute value of a_k times 2^k up to infinity is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that inequalities involving sums often use techniques like Cauchy-Schwarz or HÃ¶lder's inequality. Maybe Cauchy-Schwarz is applicable here. Let me recall the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: for any two sequences of real numbers {b_k} and {c_k}, the square of the sum of |b_k c_k| is less than or equal to the product of the sum of b_k squared and the sum of c_k squared. So, (Î£|b_k c_k|)^2 â¤ (Î£b_k^2)(Î£c_k^2).

In this problem, I have the sum of |a_k|2^k. Let me denote |a_k| as one sequence and 2^k as another. Wait, but the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality would give me (Î£|a_k|2^k)^2 â¤ (Î£a_k^2)(Î£2^{2k}). But the sum of a_k^2 is given as being related to 9^k. Wait, the problem says sum a_k^2 9^k â¤ 5. So maybe I need to adjust the Cauchy-Schwarz approach here.

Let me think. If I set b_k = |a_k| and c_k = 2^k, then Cauchy-Schwarz would say (Î£|a_k|2^k)^2 â¤ (Î£a_k^2)(Î£2^{2k}). But the sum (Î£a_k^2) here is not directly given. However, the problem gives a sum of a_k^2 9^k. Hmm. So perhaps I need to relate Î£a_k^2 to something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can use HÃ¶lder's inequality. HÃ¶lder's inequality generalizes Cauchy-Schwarz and can handle more exponents. For sequences {b_k} and {c_k}, and exponents p and q such that 1/p + 1/q = 1, then Î£|b_k c_k| â¤ (Î£|b_k|^p)^{1/p} (Î£|c_k|^q)^{1/q}. 

But in this case, if I take b_k = a_k and c_k = 2^k, then HÃ¶lder's inequality with p=2 and q=2 (which reduces to Cauchy-Schwarz) would give the same result. Maybe HÃ¶lder's with different exponents?

Wait, the given sum is Î£a_k^2 9^k. So perhaps I can express the desired sum Î£|a_k|2^k in terms of HÃ¶lder's inequality with exponents related to 9^k and something else.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in a different way. Let me think. Suppose I consider the terms |a_k|2^k as |a_k|3^k multiplied by (2/3)^k. Then, maybe I can split the product and apply Cauchy-Schwarz.

Let me try that. Let me write |a_k|2^k = |a_k|3^k * (2/3)^k. Then, by Cauchy-Schwarz, Î£|a_k|2^k = Î£ (|a_k|3^k)( (2/3)^k ) â¤ sqrt( Î£ (|a_k|3^k)^2 ) sqrt( Î£ ( (2/3)^k )^2 ).

Calculating the first sqrt term: Î£ (|a_k|3^k)^2 = Î£ a_k^2 9^k, which is given to be â¤5. The second sqrt term is Î£ ( (4/9)^k ). That's a geometric series with first term 1 and ratio 4/9. The sum is 1/(1 - 4/9) ) = 1/(5/9) = 9/5. So sqrt(9/5) = 3/sqrt(5). Therefore, the entire expression is sqrt(5) * (3/sqrt(5)) ) = 3. So that gives the desired result. Wait, that seems to work. Let me check again.

So, by Cauchy-Schwarz, we split the product |a_k|2^k into |a_k|3^k and (2/3)^k. Then the sum is less than or equal to the product of the sqrt of the sum of (|a_k|3^k)^2 and the sqrt of the sum of ( (2/3)^k )^2. The first sum is Î£ a_k^2 9^k, which is â¤5. The second sum is Î£ (4/9)^k, which is a geometric series. The sum of (4/9)^k from k=0 to â is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. So sqrt(9/5) = 3/sqrt(5). Then multiplying sqrt(5) and 3/sqrt(5) gives 3. Therefore, the total sum is â¤3. That's exactly what we needed to prove. So this seems correct.

But wait, let me verify each step again. First, the decomposition of |a_k|2^k into |a_k|3^k * (2/3)^k. That's valid because 3^k * (2/3)^k = 2^k. Then applying Cauchy-Schwarz: Î£ |x_k y_k| â¤ sqrt(Î£x_k^2) sqrt(Î£y_k^2). Here, x_k = |a_k|3^k, y_k = (2/3)^k. So yes, the inequality holds. Then the sum of x_k^2 is Î£ a_k^2 9^k, which is â¤5. The sum of y_k^2 is Î£ (4/9)^k, which is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 9/5. Taking sqrt of both terms: sqrt(5) * sqrt(9/5) = sqrt(5)*(3/sqrt(5)) = 3. Therefore, the inequality holds. So the conclusion is that the sum is â¤3, which is exactly the desired result. 

Therefore, the proof is complete. The key step was to apply Cauchy-Schwarz by splitting the term |a_k|2^k into a product that allows us to use the given bound on the sum of a_k^2 9^k and compute the sum of the squares of the other factor. The geometric series computation was straightforward, and the rest follows from algebraic manipulation. 

I think this is solid. Let me just check if there's another way to approach it, maybe using HÃ¶lder's inequality with different exponents, but given that Cauchy-Schwarz worked here, I don't need to look further. Another check: if all the inequalities are tight, like when equality holds in Cauchy-Schwarz, which requires that the vectors are proportional. That is, |a_k|3^k is proportional to (2/3)^k for all k. If equality holds, then |a_k|3^k = c*(2/3)^k for some constant c. Then |a_k| = c*(2/3)^k /3^k = c*(2/3)^{2k}. But then the sum of a_k^2 9^k would be Î£ (c^2 (2/3)^{4k}) 9^k = c^2 Î£ ( (2/3)^4 )^k *9^k = c^2 Î£ ( (16/81) )^k *9^k = c^2 Î£ (16/9)^k. Wait, but 16/9 is greater than 1, so this sum would diverge unless c=0. But the given sum is bounded by 5, so in this case, equality in Cauchy-Schwarz would require that the sum of (16/9)^k is convergent, which it isn't. Therefore, equality cannot be achieved here. Hence, the inequality is strict, and the bound of 3 is achieved only in the limit as a_k approach zero. Therefore, the maximum possible value under the given condition is indeed 3, which is tight.

Therefore, the proof is correct and complete.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use Cauchy-Schwarz in a different way. Let me think. If I have two sequences, say, x_k and y_k, then (sum x_k y_k)^2 <= (sum x_k^2)(sum y_k^2). So, if I can express sum |a_k| 2^k as sum x_k y_k, then maybe I can bound it.

Let me try to set x_k = |a_k| sqrt(9^k) and y_k = (2^k)/sqrt(9^k). Then, sum |a_k| 2^k = sum x_k y_k. Applying Cauchy-Schwarz, we get (sum x_k y_k)^2 <= (sum x_k^2)(sum y_k^2). 

Calculating x_k^2 would be (|a_k|^2)(9^k), which is exactly the term in the given sum. So sum x_k^2 = sum |a_k|^2 9^k <=5. Then, sum y_k^2 would be sum (4^k)/(9^k) = sum (4/9)^k. That's a geometric series with ratio 4/9. The sum of a geometric series from k=0 to infinity is 1/(1 - 4/9) = 1/(5/9) = 9/5. 

Therefore, (sum |a_k| 2^k)^2 <= 5 * (9/5) = 9. Taking square roots, we get sum |a_k| 2^k <= 3. Which is exactly what we need to prove. So that seems to work. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, setting x_k = |a_k|*sqrt(9^k) and y_k = 2^k / sqrt(9^k). Then, x_k y_k = |a_k|*sqrt(9^k) * 2^k / sqrt(9^k) = |a_k| 2^k, which is correct. Then, sum x_k^2 = sum |a_k|^2 9^k <=5, which is given. Sum y_k^2 is sum (4/9)^k, which is indeed 9/5. Then, the product is 5*(9/5)=9, so square root is 3. Therefore, the inequality holds.

I think that's the right approach. Let me consider if there's another way to see this, maybe using HÃ¶lder's inequality or some other method, but Cauchy-Schwarz seems straightforward here. Another thought: Maybe using the AM-QM inequality? But that might complicate things. The Cauchy-Schwarz approach seems direct.

Alternatively, could we use the concept of weighted sums? If we have the sum of a_k^2 9^k bounded, then the coefficients are weighted by 9^k, so larger k terms have higher weight. But in the sum we need to bound, the weighting is 2^k, which grows slower. So, intuitively, the coefficients a_k might be smaller for larger k because 9^k is a larger weight. Therefore, the 2^k sum should be smaller. But how to formalize that?

But the Cauchy-Schwarz approach already gives the formal proof. Let me check if the equality case is possible. For equality in Cauchy-Schwarz, we need x_k and y_k to be proportional. So |a_k| sqrt(9^k) = C * (2^k)/sqrt(9^k), so |a_k| = C * 2^k / 9^k. But then, sum |a_k|^2 9^k = sum (C^2 4^k / 9^{2k}) * 9^k = C^2 sum (4/9)^k. This sum is C^2 * 9/5. We have this equal to 5, so C^2 = (5 * 5)/9 = 25/9, so C = 5/3. Then, |a_k| = (5/3) * 2^k / 9^k. Then, sum |a_k| 2^k = (5/3) sum (2^k /9^k) *2^k = (5/3) sum (4^k /9^k) = (5/3)*(9/5) = 3. So equality is achieved when |a_k| = (5/3) (2/9)^k. Therefore, the bound is tight.

Therefore, the proof is correct. So the key step was to apply Cauchy-Schwarz with the right choice of x_k and y_k to relate the two sums. The rest is just verifying the components of the inequality. I think this should be solid.

Given that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} a_{k}^{2}9^{k} \\le 5 \\), we need to prove that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} |a_{k}|2^{k} \\le 3 \\).

We apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that for any real sequences \\( \\{b_k\\} \\) and \\( \\{c_k\\} \\),

\\[

Combining these results:

","Okay, let's try to figure out how to prove that if the sum of a_k squared times 9^k is less than or equal to 5, then the sum of |a_k| times 2^k is less than or equal to 3. Hmm, so we need to relate these two different series. The first one is the L2 norm with weights 9^k, and the second one is the L1 norm with weights 2^k. Maybe we can use some inequality here, like Cauchy-Schwarz?

Wait, Cauchy-Schwarz inequality says that for two sequences, the sum of the products is less than or equal to the product of their L2 norms. So maybe if I can write the sum of |a_k| 2^k as some kind of dot product, I can apply Cauchy-Schwarz. Let me think. If I have |a_k| 2^k, that's like the product of |a_k| and 2^k. So if I set one sequence as |a_k| and the other as 2^k, then the sum would be the dot product. Then by Cauchy-Schwarz, the sum is <= sqrt( sum |a_k|^2 ) * sqrt( sum (2^k)^2 ). Wait, but the given condition is sum a_k^2 9^k <=5. So maybe we need to adjust the weights.

Alternatively, maybe we can use HÃ¶lder's inequality? HÃ¶lder's inequality generalizes Cauchy-Schwarz and might be useful here. HÃ¶lder's inequality states that for conjugate exponents p and q (1/p + 1/q =1), the sum of |f_k g_k| <= ||f||_p ||g||_q. So if we can choose p and q such that the sum |a_k| 2^k can be represented as |f_k g_k|, then we can apply HÃ¶lder's inequality.

Let me try to set p=2 and q=2. But then HÃ¶lder's inequality reduces to Cauchy-Schwarz. Wait, but in this case, the sum |a_k| 2^k is like the sum of |a_k| * 2^k. If I take f_k = |a_k| and g_k = 2^k, then the sum is sum |a_k| 2^k <= sqrt( sum |a_k|^2 ) * sqrt( sum (2^k)^2 ). But we know that sum |a_k|^2 9^k <=5, so sum |a_k|^2 <=5 / 9^k? Wait, no. Wait, the given condition is sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k^2 9^k <=5. So if we take sum |a_k|^2, that's not directly given. However, if we let b_k = a_k / 9^{k/2}, then sum b_k^2 <=5. Then, the sum |a_k| 2^k = sum |b_k| 9^{k/2} 2^k = sum |b_k| (2*3)^k = sum |b_k| 6^k. Hmm, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe we can use HÃ¶lder's inequality with different exponents. Let me recall HÃ¶lder's inequality in the form that for sequences {x_k}, {y_k}, we have sum |x_k y_k| <= ||x||_p ||y||_q where 1/p +1/q=1. So if I set x_k = a_k and y_k = 2^k, but then the sum is sum |a_k 2^k|, and we need to bound that. If we take p=2 and q=2, then sum |a_k 2^k| <= sqrt( sum a_k^2 ) sqrt( sum 4^k ). But we don't know sum a_k^2, we know sum a_k^2 9^k <=5. So maybe that's not directly useful. Wait, but sum a_k^2 9^k = sum (a_k 3^k)^2. So if I set c_k = a_k 3^k, then sum c_k^2 <=5. Then, sum |a_k| 2^k = sum |c_k| (2/3)^k. So now we need to bound sum |c_k| (2/3)^k given that sum c_k^2 <=5. Hmm, that seems more promising.

So now the problem reduces to: Given that sum_{k=0}^\\infty c_k^2 <=5, prove that sum_{k=0}^\\infty |c_k| (2/3)^k <=3. Maybe we can apply Cauchy-Schwarz here. Let's try that. The sum sum |c_k| (2/3)^k can be written as sum |c_k| (2/3)^k. If we apply Cauchy-Schwarz, we get sum |c_k| (2/3)^k <= sqrt( sum c_k^2 ) * sqrt( sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 ). Let's compute the second term. The sum of ( (2/3)^k )^2 is sum (4/9)^k. That's a geometric series with ratio 4/9. The sum is 1/(1 -4/9) = 1/(5/9)=9/5. So sqrt(9/5)=3/sqrt(5). Therefore, the total bound would be sqrt(5) * 3/sqrt(5) =3. So that's exactly the bound we need. Therefore, sum |c_k| (2/3)^k <=3, which means sum |a_k| 2^k <=3. QED.

Wait, let me check that again. So the steps are:

1. Let c_k = a_k 3^k. Then sum c_k^2 <=5.
2. We need to bound sum |c_k| (2/3)^k.
3. Apply Cauchy-Schwarz: sum |c_k| (2/3)^k <= sqrt( sum c_k^2 ) * sqrt( sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 ).
4. sum ( (2/3)^k )^2 = sum (4/9)^k = 1/(1 -4/9) =9/5, so sqrt(9/5)=3/sqrt(5).
5. Then sqrt(5) * 3/sqrt(5)=3. Therefore, the sum is <=3.

Yes, that seems to work. Therefore, the conclusion holds. Let me verify that all steps are correct.

First, substituting c_k = a_k 3^k is valid because the sum of c_k^2 is sum a_k^2 9^k, which is equal to the given condition. Then, expressing the target sum in terms of c_k and (2/3)^k is correct. Applying Cauchy-Schwarz here is appropriate because we have the product of two sequences, |c_k| and (2/3)^k. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality gives an upper bound in terms of the L2 norms of the two sequences. Calculating the sum of (4/9)^k as a geometric series with ratio 4/9 is correct, leading to 9/5. Taking the square root gives 3/sqrt(5). Multiplying by sqrt(5) (from the first norm) gives 3. So all steps check out.

Therefore, the proof is complete.

Key points:
1. **Isometry and Developable Surfaces**: An isometry preserves the intrinsic metric (Gaussian curvature). Since \\( M \\) has zero Gaussian curvature, \\( M_t \\) must also be a developable surface (zero Gaussian curvature). Developable surfaces include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. However, cones and tangent developables introduce singularities or are non-compact, which are excluded by the requirement that \\( M_t \\) is a submanifold with boundary.
2. **Smoothness and Compactness**: The only smooth, compact developable surfaces without singularities are cylinders. This restricts any bending of \\( M \\) to another cylinder, as other developable surfaces (cones, tangent developables) cannot meet the submanifold criteria.

","Okay, let's try to figure out whether any bending of the given manifold M must leave the bases planar. The manifold M is a cylinder, right? It's defined as points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is from 0 to 2Ï and z is between 0 and 1. So, it's like a cylinder standing straight up, with the top at z=1 and the bottom at z=0.

A bending is a smooth map Î that deforms this cylinder over time t, such that each M_t is a submanifold with boundary in R^3. Also, at time t=0, Î(m,0) = m, so it starts as the original cylinder. And for every t, the map from M to M_t is an isometry. So, bending doesn't stretch or shrink the cylinder; it just bends it without changing the metric.

The question is whether any such bending must leave the bases planar. The bases here are the two circles at z=0 and z=1. Are they necessarily planar after bending?

First, I need to recall what an isometry is. In differential geometry, an isometry is a map that preserves the metric, meaning distances are preserved. So, if we have an isometric bending, the lengths of curves on the cylinder must remain the same as they were on the original cylinder.

Now, the cylinder has a standard metric, which is the product of the circle metric and the interval metric. The circle has circumference 2Ï, and the interval is just a straight line in z-direction. So, when we bend the cylinder, the metric must stay the same. But how does bending affect the geometry?

I remember that the cylinder is a developable surface, meaning it can be flattened onto a plane without stretching. So, any isometric bending should correspond to a re-embedding of the cylinder in 3D space while preserving the flat metric. However, developable surfaces can be bent in various ways, like making a cone or a helical surface, but I need to check if the bases can remain planar.

Wait, if we bend the cylinder into a cone, the bases would no longer be planar. For example, if you roll the cylinder into a cone, the base circle becomes a circle on the cone's base, which is a plane, but the top circle would be a smaller circle on the cone's surface. However, in this case, the two bases are still circles in different planes, but the original problem refers to the bases as the ones at z=0 and z=1. If we vertically bend the cylinder, maybe as a helical shape, the bases might still lie in planes?

Wait, maybe I need to think about the isometry condition more carefully. Since the bending is an isometry, the curvature of the surface must be preserved. The original cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature because it's developable. So, after bending, the Gaussian curvature must still be zero. Therefore, the surface must still be developable. Developable surfaces are either cylinders, cones, or tangent developables (like a plane or a ruled surface with zero Gaussian curvature).

So, if we start with a cylinder, any isometric bending would result in another developable surface. Now, if the surface is a cone, the base would be a circle in a plane, but the top would be a smaller circle. If we do another bending, maybe a helical one, would the bases still lie in planes?

Wait, a helical cylinder is a surface of revolution with a helical axis, which does have zero Gaussian curvature, right? Because it's a developable surface. In that case, the bases would be circles in planes, but their positions relative to each other would change. For example, in a helical cylinder, the top base is rotated with respect to the bottom base. However, the problem states that the bending is a map from M to M_t, which is a submanifold with boundary. The original cylinder has its bases at z=0 and z=1. When we bend it, say into a helical cylinder, the bases would still be circles in planes, but their positions might be rotated. However, the question is whether the bases must remain planar. Since they are circles in planes, they are planar by definition. Wait, but a circle is a planar curve. So, if the bases are circles, they lie in a plane. But if we bend the cylinder into a helical cylinder, the bases are still circles in planes, but the entire surface is helical. But in that case, the base at z=0 is still a circle in the plane z=0, just rotated. Wait, no, if you make a helical cylinder, the base at z=0 is not in the z=0 plane anymore. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the original cylinder has its bases at z=0 and z=1. If we apply a bending isometry, we can imagine deforming the cylinder into a different shape while keeping the metric the same. For example, we could roll the cylinder into a cone, which would collapse the base into a smaller circle, but the top would be another circle. However, in that case, the original two bases (z=0 and z=1) would no longer be in their original planes. Alternatively, if we perform a helical bending, perhaps the bases are still in planes, but their orientation changes.

Wait, actually, the problem says ""must any bending of M leave the bases planar?"" So, if we start with the bases at z=0 and z=1 (both in the xy-plane), and we bend the cylinder, would the images of these bases under Î(., t) still lie in planes?

In the case of a cone, the original top base (z=1) would be a circle on the cone's surface, but the cone's base is a circle in the xy-plane. Wait, if we roll the cylinder into a cone, the original base at z=0 remains in the xy-plane, and the original top at z=1 becomes a circle on the cone's surface. But in that case, the top base is not in a plane; it's a circle on the cone's surface. Wait, but the problem states that M_t must be a submanifold with boundary. The boundary of M is the two circles at z=0 and z=1. After bending, the boundary should still be the two circles, but perhaps their positions change. However, the isometry condition requires that the length of the boundary circles remains the same. So, if we roll the cylinder into a cone, the circumference of the original base (radius 1) would have to be preserved. But the circumference of the base of the cone would be smaller, unless we scale it. Wait, but an isometry must preserve all lengths. So, if we start with a cylinder of radius 1, the circumference is 2Ï. If we roll it into a cone, the base circumference would have to remain 2Ï, so the radius of the base of the cone would still be 1. But in that case, the cone would be a flat cone, which is just a cylinder. Wait, that's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the only isometric bendings of the cylinder are those that correspond to rigid motions or helical motions. For example, a helical bending would involve rotating the cylinder as you move along its length, but keeping the metric the same. In this case, the bases would still be circles in planes, but their positions relative to each other would be rotated. For instance, the base at z=0 would remain in the xy-plane, and the base at z=1 would be in a plane that's rotated by some angle as you go up. However, the problem states that the map is a bending, so maybe such a helical bending is allowed, and in that case, the bases are still planar.

But wait, if we do a helical bending, the entire surface is a helicoid, which is a developable surface. However, in this case, the boundary circles would still lie in planes. For example, the bottom base remains in the original plane, and the top base is in a plane that's tilted. Wait, but in a helicoid, the surface is a ruled surface with zero Gaussian curvature. However, the boundary circles would not lie in planes if the helicoid is not a right circular cylinder. Wait, actually, in a helicoid, the boundary circles would still lie in planes, but their positions are rotated. For example, imagine the helicoid as a cylinder that's been twisted along its length. The bottom base stays in the xy-plane, and the top base is in a plane that's been rotated by some angle as you go up. But in that case, each base is still planar.

Alternatively, if we consider a bending that is not a simple helical motion, perhaps there's a way to bend the cylinder such that the bases are not in planes. Wait, but how? Since the bending is an isometry, the metric must be preserved. The original cylinder has its bases as circles in planes. If we somehow deform the cylinder into a different shape where the bases are not planar, would that be possible?

Wait, maybe not. Because the metric on the cylinder is flat, and any isometric embedding of a flat cylinder into R^3 must be a developable surface. All developable surfaces are either cylinders, cones, or tangent developables. Cones and tangent developables have singularities where the surface doesn't have a unique tangent plane, but the problem states that M_t must be a submanifold with boundary, which implies that it should be a smooth manifold without singularities. Therefore, the only possible isometric bendings are cylinders or helical cylinders. Wait, but a helical cylinder is a ruled surface that is a developable surface. However, if we have a helical cylinder, the two bases are still circles in planes, but their positions are rotated. For example, in a helical cylinder, the angle of the helix is constant, so as you go along the z-axis, the circles are rotated by a constant angle. Therefore, the bottom base is in the xy-plane, and the top base is in a plane that's been rotated by, say, some angle Î¸. However, both bases are still planar.

Wait, but how can you rotate the top base? If you have a helical bending, then each point on the original cylinder is moved along a helical path. However, the boundary circles at z=0 and z=1 would still lie in planes. For example, the points at z=0 are (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0) and at z=1 are (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 1). If you bend it helically, the top circle might be mapped to a circle in a plane that's rotated. But would that plane still be horizontal? No, because if you rotate the top circle around the z-axis as you move along the z-direction, the plane of the top circle would tilt. Wait, maybe not. Let me think.

Suppose we define a bending as a helical motion. For example, for each point (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z), we map it to (cos(Î¸ + Î±z), sin(Î¸ + Î±z), z), where Î± is some constant. Then, the bottom base at z=0 is (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0), which is the same as before. The top base at z=1 is (cos(Î¸ + Î±), sin(Î¸ + Î±), 1). This is a circle in the plane z=1, rotated by Î±. So, the top base is still planar, just rotated. Similarly, other bases at intermediate z-values would be circles in planes z=z0, rotated by Î± z0. Therefore, in this case, all bases remain in planes, just rotated. Therefore, the bases are still planar.

Alternatively, maybe there's another bending where the bases are not planar. But since the bending is an isometry, and the original bases are planar, perhaps their images must also be planar. Wait, but how?

Wait, the original cylinder has its boundary as two circles in planes. If we have an isometric bending, then the boundary must still be two circles with the same circumference. But can we have two circles with the same circumference that are not in a plane? For example, two circles on a cone. But on a cone, the circles are not in planes; they are in parallel planes? Wait, no. On a cone, the circles are not in planes unless the cone is a cylinder. Wait, a cone is not developable unless it's a cylinder. Wait, no, a cone is developable, but its surface is not flat. Wait, the cone's Gaussian curvature is zero, but it's not a flat surface; it's a cone. However, if we have two circles on a cone, they lie on parallel planes. Wait, no, on a cone, the circles are not in parallel planes. Wait, actually, on a cone, the circles are in planes that intersect along the cone's axis. For example, in a cone with apex at the origin, the circles are at different heights z, but they lie in planes that are not parallel. So, in that case, the circles are not in parallel planes, but they are in planes that all intersect at the apex.

But in our problem, the original cylinder has two circles (bases) in parallel planes (z=0 and z=1). If we bend the cylinder into a cone, the two bases would lie in planes that intersect at the cone's apex. Therefore, they are not in parallel planes. But the problem states that the bending must leave M_t as a submanifold with boundary. If the two bases are circles in non-parallel planes, then the boundary of M_t would consist of two circles in non-parallel planes. However, the original problem refers to the ""bases"" as the two circles at z=0 and z=1. If we bend the cylinder into a cone, then those original two circles (now part of the cone) would lie in planes that are not parallel. Therefore, their images under the bending are not in parallel planes. Therefore, in such a case, the bases would not remain planar in the sense of lying in parallel planes. But the question is whether the bases must remain planar, not necessarily that they lie in parallel planes.

Wait, but the problem says ""leave the bases planar"". The bases are the two circles at the ends. If they are mapped to circles in planes, then they are planar. However, if they are mapped to circles on a cone's surface, which are not in a plane, then they are not planar. Wait, but on the cone, the circles are in planes. Wait, no, on a cone, the circles are in planes that intersect at the apex. For example, consider a cone with apex at (0,0,0) and base at z=1. The circles on the cone are at different heights z, but each circle lies in a plane z = constant. Wait, no. Wait, a cone can be parametrized as (r cosÎ¸, r sinÎ¸, z), where r = kz for some constant k. So, if we have a circle at height z, it's (kz cosÎ¸, kz sinÎ¸, z). This lies in the plane z = constant, but scaled. Wait, but in this case, the circle at z is in the plane z = constant, but with radius kz. So, if we have two circles at z=0 and z=1, the one at z=0 is a point (the apex) and the one at z=1 is a circle in the plane z=1. But in our original cylinder, the two bases are at z=0 and z=1, both in their own planes. If we bend the cylinder into a cone, the base at z=0 becomes the apex of the cone (a point), and the base at z=1 becomes a circle in the plane z=1. However, the problem states that the bending is a map from M to M_t, which is a submanifold with boundary. If the apex is a point, then the boundary of M_t would be just the circle at z=1, but the original M had two circles as boundary. Therefore, such a bending would not preserve the boundary as two circles, unless we consider a different cone.

Wait, maybe we need to consider a different type of cone. Suppose we roll the cylinder into a cone such that both bases are circles. For example, if we cut a sector out of the cylinder's surface and glue the edges, forming a cone. In this case, the original two circles (bases) would become two circles on the cone's surface. But in a cone, these two circles are in parallel planes? No, they are not. If you roll the cylinder into a cone, the circles are not in parallel planes. For example, in a cone, the circles lie in planes that intersect at the apex. So, if you have a cone with apex at the origin, a circle at height z=1 is in the plane z=1, and another circle at height z=2 is in the plane z=2, but these planes are not parallel. Therefore, the images of the original bases under the bending are circles in non-parallel planes. Therefore, they are not planar in the sense that they lie in a single plane. Wait, but each circle lies in its own plane. Each circle is in a plane, so they are planar individually. But the problem says ""leave the bases planar"", which might mean that both bases lie in the same plane. But the original bases are in different planes (z=0 and z=1). So, maybe the answer is that the bases must remain in their respective planes, but that's not necessarily the case.

Wait, maybe I need to think differently. The question is whether any bending must leave the bases planar. So, if there exists a bending where the bases are not planar, then the answer is no. If all bendings must leave the bases planar, then the answer is yes.

But how can the bases not be planar? If the bending is an isometry, then the metric must be preserved. The original bases are circles in planes, and their length is 2Ï. If we change the geometry, can we have two circles with length 2Ï that are not in planes?

Wait, a circle in 3D space can lie in a plane, but a curve that is not planar but has the same circumference. However, the problem states that the bending must be a submanifold with boundary, which implies that the boundary is a 1-dimensional manifold, i.e., a curve. But a non-planar curve is still a curve. However, the original bases are planar circles. If we can bend the cylinder such that the images of the bases are non-planar curves, then the answer would be no. But can this happen?

But an isometry preserves the metric. The original metric on the cylinder is flat, so the isometric image must also have a flat metric. However, the extrinsic curvature (how the surface is embedded in R^3) can differ. But the intrinsic metric (Gaussian curvature) must remain zero. Therefore, the surface must be developable. The only developable surfaces with two boundary circles (each of circumference 2Ï) are cylinders or cones. However, cones have a point at the apex, so if we roll the cylinder into a cone, one of the bases becomes a point, which is not a circle. Therefore, such a bending would not have both bases as circles. Therefore, only cylinders and helical cylinders (which are developable) can have both bases as circles. In that case, the bases are planar.

Wait, but a helical cylinder is not a cylinder in the traditional sense. It's a ruled surface that is a developable surface. However, its boundary circles are still in planes. For example, if you take a cylinder and twist it along its axis, the top and bottom circles are still in horizontal planes, just rotated relative to each other. Therefore, their images under the bending are still in planes. Therefore, in this case, the bases remain planar.

Alternatively, is there a way to bend the cylinder isometrically such that the bases are not in planes? For example, if we create a surface of revolution that is not a cylinder or a cone. But a surface of revolution with zero Gaussian curvature must be a cylinder or a cone. Because the Gaussian curvature is zero, it's a developable surface. Therefore, any isometric bending must be a developable surface, which can only be a cylinder, cone, or tangent developable. But a tangent developable has a boundary that is a curve, not two circles. Therefore, the only possibilities are cylinders and cones. However, cones have a singular point (the apex), so if we want a submanifold with boundary, which is a smooth manifold without singularities, then the only possibilities are cylinders and helical cylinders. Therefore, in such cases, the bases are still in planes.

Therefore, it seems that any isometric bending of the cylinder must result in another cylinder or a helical cylinder, both of which have bases lying in planes. Therefore, the answer should be yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

But wait, let's think again. Suppose we have a cylinder and perform a helical bending, as described earlier. The top base is rotated relative to the bottom base but still lies in a plane. Therefore, both bases are in planes. If we perform a different bending, say, a bending that is not a simple twist but some other isometric deformation, would the bases still lie in planes?

Another thought: the isometry condition implies that the cylinder's metric is preserved. The cylinder is a flat surface, so the isometric image must also be flat. In R^3, the only flat surfaces are planes, cylinders, and tangent developables. But tangent developables are not closed surfaces, so in our case, since M is a cylinder (closed in the Î¸ direction but open in the z direction), the only possible isometric images are cylinders or helical cylinders (which are cylinders with a twist). Therefore, the boundaries must still be circles in planes.

Thus, it seems that the answer is yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

But wait, another example: suppose we take the cylinder and bend it into a helicoid. A helicoid is a ruled surface with zero Gaussian curvature, but it is not a developable surface? Wait, no, a helicoid is a developable surface. Wait, no, actually, a helicoid is a minimal surface with zero mean curvature, but it's not developable. Wait, maybe I confused developable surfaces with minimal surfaces. Let me check.

A developable surface is one with zero Gaussian curvature, which can be isometrically embedded in R^3 as a ruled surface. Examples include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. The helicoid is a minimal surface with zero mean curvature, but its Gaussian curvature is not zero. Wait, no, the helicoid actually has zero Gaussian curvature? Wait, no. The Gaussian curvature is the product of the principal curvatures. For a helicoid, the principal curvatures are k1 = 0 and k2 = -k for some k, so Gaussian curvature is zero. Wait, yes, the helicoid is a developable surface. Therefore, it is a developable surface with zero Gaussian curvature. So, it is a valid isometric bending of the cylinder.

But in the helicoid, the boundary circles are not in planes. Wait, no. Wait, the helicoid is a surface generated by a straight line moving along a helix. If we take the helicoid and consider its boundary, it would be two circles that are not in parallel planes. Wait, but the original cylinder's boundaries are at z=0 and z=1. If we map them to the helicoid, the points at z=0 and z=1 would be mapped to two circles on the helicoid. However, on the helicoid, those circles would not lie in planes. Wait, actually, in the standard helicoid parametrization, the surface is given by (u cos v, u sin v, c v), where u and v are parameters. If we set z = c v, then for a fixed z, say z=0, u is arbitrary, but v=0. So, the point is (u, 0, 0), which is a line. Similarly, for z=1, v=1/c, and the points are (u cos(1/c), u sin(1/c), 1). So, this is a line in the plane z=1, but varying u. Wait, but this is a line, not a circle. Therefore, the boundaries of the helicoid are not circles. Therefore, such a bending would not preserve the boundary as two circles. Therefore, it's not a valid bending as per the problem's definition.

Therefore, the only valid bendings that preserve the boundary as two circles must correspond to cylinders or helical cylinders (which are cylinders with a twist). In both cases, the bases are circles in planes. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But wait, another thought: suppose we have a cylinder and we perform a bending that is a combination of a twist and a translation. For example, bending it into a helical cylinder but also moving it vertically. However, the vertical translation would not preserve the z-coordinate. Wait, but the bending map must be a function from M to R^3, so it can move the points in 3D space. However, the isometry condition requires that the metric is preserved. If we perform a vertical translation, that would not be an isometry because it would change the lengths along the z-axis. Wait, no. Wait, the original cylinder has a metric where the z-coordinate is Euclidean, and the Î¸-coordinate is a circle. If we perform a vertical translation, say, mapping (Î¸, z) to (Î¸, z + f(z)), where f is some function, then the z-component would be stretched, which would not be an isometry. Therefore, such a bending would not be isometric.

Therefore, the only isometric bendings are those that correspond to rigid motions (translation, rotation, reflection) and helical motions (rotation around the axis while translating along the axis). In both cases, the bases remain in planes.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

But wait, let's consider a different approach. The problem states that the bending must leave M_t as a submanifold with boundary. The original M has two boundary circles. If we can show that any isometric bending must preserve the boundary as two circles in planes, then the answer is yes. Alternatively, if there's a bending where the boundary is not in planes, then the answer is no.

But how can the boundary not be in planes? The boundary of M_t must be two curves. If they are not in planes, they would be non-planar curves. However, the original boundary circles are planar. If an isometry maps them to non-planar curves, that would would change the intrinsic geometry, but since the bending is an isometry, the intrinsic geometry (metric) is preserved. However, the extrinsic geometry can change. But the boundary curves' length must remain 2Ï. However, a non-planar curve can have the same length as a planar circle. For example, a helical curve can have the same circumference as a planar circle. But in our case, the boundary is not a single curve but two circles.

Wait, but the boundary of M_t is a 1-dimensional manifold with two components. If the bending maps the original two circles to two non-planar curves, then the boundaries are not planar. However, in order for M_t to be a submanifold with boundary, those boundaries must be smooth curves. However, the original problem states that the bending is a smooth map. Therefore, the boundaries should be smooth curves. However, even if the boundaries are non-planar, as long as they are smooth curves, it's allowed. Therefore, the question is whether such a bending is possible.

But according to the isometry condition, the metric on M_t must be the same as on M. Since M is a cylinder, its metric is flat. Therefore, M_t must also have a flat metric. In R^3, the only surfaces with flat metric are planes, cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. However, cones and tangent developables have singularities where the Gaussian curvature is not zero. Therefore, the only smooth surfaces with flat metric are planes, cylinders, and helical cylinders (which are cylinders with a twist). Therefore, the boundaries of these surfaces are circles in planes. Therefore, any isometric bending must result in a cylinder or helical cylinder, both of which have bases in planes. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Therefore, after this lengthy thinking, I believe the answer is yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

The manifold \\( M \\) is a cylinder defined by \\( M = \\{(\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta), z) : \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi], z \\in [0, 1]\\} \\). A bending of \\( M \\) is a smooth map \\( \\Gamma: M \\times [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3 \\) such that each \\( M_t = \\Gamma[M \\times \\{t\\}] \\) is a submanifold with boundary, \\( \\Gamma(m, 0) = m \\), and each \\( M_t \\) is isometric to \\( M \\).

Key points:
1. **Isometry and Developable Surfaces**: An isometry preserves the intrinsic metric (Gaussian curvature). Since \\( M \\) has zero Gaussian curvature, \\( M_t \\) must also be a developable surface (zero Gaussian curvature). Developable surfaces include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. However, cones and tangent developables introduce singularities or are non-compact, which are excluded by the requirement that \\( M_t \\) is a submanifold with boundary.
2. **Smoothness and Compactness**: The only smooth, compact developable surfaces without singularities are cylinders. This restricts any bending of \\( M \\) to another cylinder, as other developable surfaces (cones, tangent developables) cannot meet the submanifold criteria.
3. **Planar Bases**: A cylinder's bases are planar circles. Any isometric bending preserving the cylinder structure must keep the bases planar. Fenchel's theorem implies that closed curves with total curvature \\( 2\\pi \\) must be planar, supporting that the bases remain planar under isometry.

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether any bending of the manifold M must leave the bases planar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, M is defined as the set of points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is between 0 and 2Ï, and z is between 0 and 1. That sounds like a cylinder, right? Because for each z, you have a circle parameterized by Î¸, and z goes from 0 to 1. So M is a cylinder with radius 1, height 1, and the bases are the circles at z=0 and z=1.

Now, a bending of M is a smooth map Î from M Ã [0,1] to RÂ³ that satisfies three conditions:

1. For each t, Î[MÃ{t}] is a submanifold with boundary of RÂ³, denoted M_t.
2. At t=0, Î(m, 0) = m, so the initial position is the original cylinder.
3. For each t, the map m â Î(m, t) is an isometry between M and M_t.

So a bending is like a smooth deformation of the cylinder where each M_t is isometric to the original M. That means the intrinsic geometry of the cylinder is preserved during the bending. The question is whether such a bending must keep the bases (the circles at z=0 and z=1) planar.

I remember that when you bend a cylinder, you can twist it, but if you do so while keeping the length of every curve the same, the twist can be arbitrary. However, maybe there are restrictions due to the isometry condition. Let me think.

In differential geometry, an isometry between surfaces preserves the first fundamental form, which encodes lengths and angles. So if we bend the cylinder isometrically, the length of any curve on the cylinder should remain the same. For the original cylinder, the height is 1, and the circumference of the base is 2Ï. If we twist the cylinder, say into a helical shape, would that preserve the length?

Wait, if we twist the cylinder, the helical surface is not a cylinder anymore, but a helicoid. However, a helicoid is not isometric to a cylinder. Wait, is that true? Let me recall. The helicoid is a minimal surface and is isometric to the plane, but a cylinder is not isometric to the plane. So, maybe twisting the cylinder is not an isometry.

Alternatively, maybe we can bend the cylinder into another cylinder with the same height and circumference. For example, a cylinder of radius 1 and height 1 can be bent into another cylinder with the same dimensions but rotated around its axis. But even so, the bases would still be planar.

But wait, can we bend the cylinder into a different shape where the bases are not planar? For instance, if we twist it such that the top base is tilted with respect to the bottom base. However, such a deformation might not preserve the isometry.

Let me recall that a cylinder is a developable surface, meaning it can be flattened into a plane without stretching. The Gaussian curvature of a cylinder is zero. If we perform an isometric bending, the Gaussian curvature must remain zero because isometries preserve curvature. So, the bent surface must still be developable. Developable surfaces include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. However, cones have a singularity at the tip, which is not present in our cylinder. So perhaps the only developable surfaces without singularities are cylinders and tangent developables.

Wait, tangent developables are surfaces formed by moving a straight line (a generator) along a curve (the directrix) such that the line is always tangent to the directrix. These are different from cylinders. So, if we can bend our cylinder into a tangent developable, would that surface have non-planar bases?

But the original cylinder has two circular bases. If we bend it into a tangent developable, the bases might become non-planar. However, the tangent developable is a ruled surface, and its base (if we consider the original cylinder's bases) might not be planar anymore. But I need to check if such a bending is possible while preserving the isometry.

Wait, but the problem states that the bending must be an isometry. So, if we change the cylinder into another cylinder, that's fine because cylinders are isometric. But if we try to make the bases non-planar, we might have to curve the surface in a way that changes the Gaussian curvature, which is impossible because isometries preserve curvature. Therefore, the bent surface must have zero Gaussian curvature, hence must be a developable surface. The only developable surfaces without singularities are cylinders and tangent developables. However, tangent developables are different because they have a different structure. Wait, but can a tangent developable have two planar circles as its boundaries?

I think not. A tangent developable is generated by a curve and its tangent lines. If you start with a circle at z=0 and then move the tangent line along a curve, the resulting surface might not have the top base as a planar circle. For example, if the directrix is a helix, the tangent developable would be a helicoid, but a helicoid is not a cylinder. But the helicoid does have a planar boundary? Wait, a helicoid has a boundary that is a line at infinity, so perhaps not. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to recall that a tangent developable is a surface where each generator is tangent to the directrix. If the directrix is a curve in space, then the tangent developable is the set of all tangent lines to that curve. If the directrix is a circle, then the tangent developable would be a cylinder. Wait, no, if the directrix is a circle, then the tangent lines would form a cylinder. Wait, but in that case, the tangent developable of a circle is the cylinder itself. So, maybe the cylinder is a special case of a tangent developable.

But if we take another directrix, say a helix, then the tangent developable would be the helicoid. However, the helicoid is not a cylinder. The helicoid has a planar boundary? Wait, a helicoid extends to infinity, so it doesn't have a planar boundary like the cylinder. The cylinder's boundaries are circles at z=0 and z=1.

Therefore, if we want to bend the cylinder into another developable surface with two planar curves as boundaries, the only possibility is another cylinder. Because tangent developables with planar boundaries would require the directrix to be a planar curve, but in that case, the surface would be a cylinder. Wait, maybe not. Let me think again.

Suppose we have a cylinder, which can be viewed as a tangent developable with directrix a line segment (the axis of the cylinder). Wait, no, the directrix for a cylinder is a line, and the generators are the circles. Hmm, maybe I need to recall the definition of a tangent developable.

A tangent developable surface is a ruled surface where each generator is tangent to the directrix. The directrix is a curve in space, and each generator is a line tangent to this curve at some point. For example, the tangent developable of a circle is the cylinder itself. If the directrix is a helix, then the tangent developable is the helicoid. However, the helicoid is not a cylinder. The helicoid has a boundary at infinity, so it doesn't have finite planar boundaries like the original cylinder.

Therefore, if we try to bend the original cylinder into another developable surface with two planar curves as boundaries, the only possibility is another cylinder. Because the tangent developables with finite planar boundaries would have to be cylinders. Therefore, the only isometric bends of the cylinder are other cylinders, which have planar bases. Therefore, any bending must leave the bases planar.

Wait, but the problem says ""planar"" bases. The original bases are planar circles. If we bend the cylinder into another cylinder, say with a different radius or height, but in our case, the original cylinder has height 1. However, the problem doesn't specify that the height remains 1. Wait, the original M is a cylinder with height 1, but when we bend it, the height might change as long as the isometry is preserved. Wait, no. The isometry preserves the intrinsic metric, but extrinsic properties like height can change. Wait, but in our case, the original cylinder has both the height and the circumference. If we bend it into another cylinder, the circumference must remain the same because the isometry preserves lengths. The circumference is 2Ï, so the radius of the bent cylinder must remain 1. The height can change, but in our problem, the original cylinder has height 1. Wait, but the problem states that M is the set with z in [0,1], so the height is 1. However, when we bend it, the height of M_t might not be 1 anymore. Wait, but the isometry only preserves the intrinsic metric, not the extrinsic geometry. So, the height in 3D can change, but the lengths along the cylinder (its intrinsic geometry) are preserved.

But the problem is specifically asking whether the bases must remain planar. The original bases are planar. If we bend the cylinder into another cylinder with the same radius and different height, the bases would still be planar. If we bend it into a helicoid, the bases might not be planar. But earlier I thought that helicoid is not isometric to the cylinder. Wait, is the helicoid isometric to the cylinder?

Actually, the helicoid and the cylinder are both developable surfaces, but they are not isometric to each other. Wait, no, in fact, the helicoid is a minimal surface, and the cylinder is a developable surface. However, the helicoid is not isometric to the plane, but the cylinder is isometric to the plane when you cut it along a generator. Wait, maybe they are not isometric to each other.

Wait, perhaps I need to recall that the cylinder is a special case of a developable surface, and any isometric bending of a cylinder must result in another cylinder. Because the cylinder is flat, and any isometric deformation of a flat surface is an affine transformation, but in 3D, this might not hold. Wait, in 2D, isometric deformations of flat surfaces are affine transformations, but in 3D, the cylinder can be bent into a different shape while preserving the flatness.

But according to the problem, the bending is a smooth map Î: M Ã [0,1] â RÂ³ such that each M_t is a submanifold with boundary, Î(m,0)=m, and each M_t is isometric to M. So, if we can find an isometric bending where the bases are not planar, then the answer is no. Otherwise, if all isometric bendings must have planar bases, then the answer is yes.

Another approach: Let's consider the induced metric on M. Since M is a cylinder, the metric is flat (Gaussian curvature zero). Therefore, any isometric bending must preserve this flatness, so the resulting surface M_t must also be flat. Hence, M_t must be a developable surface. Developable surfaces are either cylinders, cones, or tangent developables. But cones have a singularity at the tip, which is a point where the surface doesn't have a normal vector. Since M is a smooth surface without singularities, M_t must also be a smooth developable surface without singularities. Therefore, M_t must be a cylinder or a tangent developable without singularities.

But the tangent developables without singularities can be cylinders (if the directrix is a line) or other ruled surfaces. Wait, but if the directrix is a line, then the tangent developable is a cylinder. If the directrix is a curve with non-zero curvature, then the tangent developable is a different surface. However, for such a surface to have two planar boundaries, it's only possible if it's a cylinder. For example, if the directrix is a helix, the tangent developable is a helicoid, which does not have planar boundaries. Therefore, the only developable surfaces with two planar curves as boundaries are cylinders. Hence, any isometric bending of M must result in another cylinder, hence the bases must remain planar.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

Wait, but let me check another way. Suppose we try to bend the cylinder into a helicoid. Is the helicoid isometric to the cylinder? I don't think so. The helicoid has zero Gaussian curvature but a different metric. For example, the cylinder has coordinates (Î¸, z), and the helicoid can be parameterized by (u cos v, u sin v, a v + b z), but I need to check the metric. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall that the cylinder and the helicoid are both developable surfaces, but they are not isometric unless a=0, which would make it a cylinder. So, if a â  0, the helicoid is not isometric to the cylinder. Therefore, such a bending would not preserve the isometry.

Therefore, only bends that result in cylinders are isometries. Hence, the bases must remain planar.

Another angle: The original bases are circles in perpendicular planes (z=0 and z=1). If we could bend the cylinder such that the top base is not planar, that would require that the surface between the two bases is not a cylinder anymore. However, since the isometry must preserve the metric, which is flat, the surface must remain developable. Developable surfaces with two planar boundaries are only cylinders. Therefore, the bases must stay planar.

Therefore, I think the answer is yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

The manifold \\( M \\) is a cylinder defined by \\( M = \\{(\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta), z) : \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi], z \\in [0, 1]\\} \\). A bending of \\( M \\) is a smooth map \\( \\Gamma: M \\times [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3 \\) such that each \\( M_t = \\Gamma[M \\times \\{t\\}] \\) is a submanifold with boundary, \\( \\Gamma(m, 0) = m \\), and each \\( M_t \\) is isometric to \\( M \\).

Key points:
1. **Isometry and Developable Surfaces**: An isometry preserves the intrinsic metric (Gaussian curvature). Since \\( M \\) has zero Gaussian curvature, \\( M_t \\) must also be a developable surface (zero Gaussian curvature). Developable surfaces include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. However, cones and tangent developables introduce singularities or are non-compact, which are excluded by the requirement that \\( M_t \\) is a submanifold with boundary.
2. **Smoothness and Compactness**: The only smooth, compact developable surfaces without singularities are cylinders. This restricts any bending of \\( M \\) to another cylinder, as other developable surfaces (cones, tangent developables) cannot meet the submanifold criteria.
3. **Planar Bases**: A cylinder's bases are planar circles. Any isometric bending preserving the cylinder structure must keep the bases planar. Fenchel's theorem implies that closed curves with total curvature \\( 2\\pi \\) must be planar, supporting that the bases remain planar under isometry.

Thus, any bending of \\( M \\) must leave the bases planar.

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether any bending of the manifold M must leave the bases planar. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the manifold M is defined as all points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is between 0 and 2Ï, and z is between 0 and 1. So, this is like a cylinder, right? The base is the circle at z=0, and the top is the circle at z=1. The rest is the lateral surface connecting them. So, M is a cylinder with height 1.

A bending of M is a smooth map Î from MÃ[0,1] to RÂ³, such that:

1. For each t in [0,1], Î[MÃ{t}] is a submanifold with boundary. So, each level M_t is a submanifold with boundary, meaning it's a surface with edges, like a cylinder might have a circular edge at each end.

2. When t=0, Î(m,0) = m. So, the bending starts with the original cylinder.

3. For every t, the map m â Î(m,t) is an isometry between M and M_t. So, each M_t is isometric to the original cylinder. That means distances on the surface are preserved, right? So, the bending doesn't stretch or shrink the surface; it just bends it in 3D space.

The question is: Must any such bending leave the bases planar? The bases are the two circles at z=0 and z=1 in the original cylinder. So, after bending, do these circles have to remain planar (i.e., lie on a flat plane)?

Hmm. Let me think. First, the original cylinder has both bases lying on the xy-plane. When we bend it, we're allowed to deform it in 3D space, but keeping the distances on the surface the same. The key here is that the bending is an isometry, so the intrinsic geometry is preserved. But extrinsic properties can change. For example, a cylinder can be bent into a cone without stretching, but the cone has a different extrinsic shape, even though the intrinsic metric is preserved (except at the tip, maybe).

Wait, but in this case, the bending is defined for each t, so maybe M_t can be a cone? But cones have a different Gaussian curvature. The original cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. If we bend it into a cone, the Gaussian curvature would be non-zero at the tip. But since the bending is an isometry, the Gaussian curvature must be preserved. Wait, but the original cylinder has zero curvature, so the bent surface must also have zero Gaussian curvature. Therefore, the only surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature are cylinders, cones, and the plane. But cones have a different curvature at the tip, so maybe only cylinders and planes? Wait, no. A cylinder has zero curvature everywhere, a cone has zero curvature except at the tip, which is a singularity. Wait, actually, the cone is a developable surface, which is locally flat, but globally has a different topology. However, in our case, the original cylinder is a compact surface with boundary, right? The original cylinder has two boundary circles. If we bend it into another developable surface, like another cylinder or a cone, but cones have a single boundary? Wait, no, a cone would have a circular base and the tip is a point, but in our case, the surfaces M_t are supposed to have boundaries. So maybe cones are not allowed because they have a single boundary point (the tip)? Wait, but in the problem statement, it says ""submanifold with boundary"". So, the cone would have a boundary at the base, but the tip is not a boundary point, it's just an ordinary point? Wait, maybe cones are not submanifolds with boundary in the way we need. Let me check.

A submanifold with boundary in RÂ³ would have a boundary that is a 1-dimensional manifold. For the cone, the boundary would be the base circle, and the tip is an interior point. So, in that case, the cone would be a submanifold with boundary (the base circle) and an interior point (the tip). But the problem statement says ""submanifold with boundary"", so as long as the boundary is a 1-dimensional manifold, maybe the cone is acceptable. However, the cone has a different topology compared to the cylinder; the cylinder has two boundary components (top and bottom circles), while the cone has only one (the base). Therefore, if the bending is an isometric deformation, but the resulting surface M_t must have the same topology as M, which is a cylinder with two boundary circles. Therefore, cones are out, since they have a different topology (only one boundary circle). Therefore, the only possible isometric deformations would be other cylinders? But are there other developable surfaces with the same topology?

Wait, developable surfaces are surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature, and they can be isometrically embedded into RÂ³. The cylinder is one, the cone is another, and the plane is another. But the plane is not compact. Our original cylinder is compact, so the plane is not an option. The cone is a developable surface, but as we saw, it has a different topology. So maybe the only possible isometric deformations of the cylinder that preserve the topology (two boundary circles) are other cylinders? But how can you deform a cylinder into another cylinder in RÂ³? For example, you can twist it, but the distance between the two boundaries would have to remain the same. Wait, but if you twist a cylinder, the intrinsic distances are preserved, but extrinsically, it's a helical cylinder. But the bases would still be circles in their respective planes. Wait, but if you twist the cylinder, the original bases (at z=0 and z=1) would become helical? No, the bases would still be circles, but their positions in space would be different. Wait, no. If you twist the cylinder, the top and bottom circles would still lie in their original planes, but rotated relative to each other. Wait, but perhaps they can be twisted along the axis, so that each point on the top circle is translated along a helical path. But in that case, the bases themselves are still circles lie in planes. Wait, but is that an isometric bending?

Wait, if you twist a cylinder, say, like making a helical cylinder, is that an isometry? Let me think. On the cylinder, the metric is defined by the induced Riemannian metric from RÂ³. If we twist the cylinder, keeping the surface distances the same but changing the extrinsic shape, is that possible? For example, imagine taking a cylinder and twisting it so that the top circle is rotated by some angle relative to the bottom. The distance between points on the surface would remain the same, but the extrinsic shape is different. However, in this case, the bases (top and bottom) would still lie in their original planes, just rotated. So, their planes are still flat. Therefore, the bases remain planar.

But maybe there is a way to bend the cylinder so that the bases are not planar. For example, if you could somehow curve the cylinder into a shape where the top and bottom circles are not in parallel planes. But how?

Wait, but if the cylinder is bent such that the original bases are not in parallel planes, then the distance between points on the cylinders might change. For example, if you bend the cylinder into a helical shape, but then the vertical distance between the top and bottom might change. Wait, but the height of the cylinder is fixed at 1. If you bend it, can you preserve the vertical height? Hmm.

Wait, the problem states that the bending is an isometry between M and M_t. So, distances on the surface are preserved. But the extrinsic geometry can change. However, the original cylinder has both bases lying on horizontal planes. If you bend it, can you make the bases lie on non-parallel planes? For example, imagine bending the cylinder so that the top circle is tilted relative to the bottom. Then, the two bases would lie on planes that are not parallel. But would that preserve the distances on the surface?

Wait, let's model this. Suppose we have a cylinder parameterized by Î¸ and z, where Î¸ is the angular coordinate and z is the vertical coordinate. If we apply a bending that maps z to z + f(Î¸), for some function f(Î¸), then the surface becomes a helicoidal surface. But in this case, the vertical distance between the top and bottom would still be 1, because f(Î¸) is periodic. However, the extrinsic shape is a helicoid. But in this case, the bases would still lie in parallel planes. Wait, but maybe if we allow a more general bending?

Wait, perhaps if we allow the cylinder to be bent into a shape where the original vertical direction is moved to a slant direction. For example, if we shear the cylinder along the vertical direction. But in that case, the distances on the surface would change unless the shearing is done isometrically. But shearing a cylinder in 3D space without stretching the surface would require that the surface remains a cylinder. Wait, no. If you shear the cylinder, the vertical distance between points could change. For example, if you shear it along the axis, the vertical length between the top and bottom would remain 1, but the extrinsic shape would be a slant cylinder. However, such a shearing might not preserve the metric. Wait, but if the shearing is such that the surface remains a cylinder, then the metric would be preserved. Wait, but how can you shear a cylinder into another cylinder? If you shear it along the axis, the surface would still be a cylinder, but the original vertical direction is now slant. But in that case, the distance between points on the surface would be preserved because the cylinder's metric is still the same. Wait, but the extrinsic geometry would change. However, the bases would now lie in non-parallel planes. For example, imagine taking the cylinder and tilting it so that the top circle is in a plane that is not parallel to the bottom. Then, the distance between the two circles along the vertical axis would be preserved, but their planes are not parallel. However, is such a bending possible while preserving the surface distances?

Wait, but if you tilt the cylinder, the vertical distance between the two bases remains the same, but their planes are now slant. However, in this case, the surface is still a cylinder, just tilted. But the problem is whether such a bending is an isometry. Wait, if you tilt the cylinder without stretching, then the surface distances are preserved, so it is an isometry. Therefore, in this case, the bases are still circles lying in planes, but the planes are not parallel. Therefore, the bases are not planar relative to each other. Wait, but the question is whether the bases themselves are planar. Each base is a circle lying in its own plane. If the planes are not parallel, does that mean the bases are not planar? Wait, no. Each base is a circle in its own plane, so each base is planar individually. The question is whether the bases must remain in the same plane as the original, or can they be in different planes as long as they are planar.

Wait, the original bases are in the xy-plane. If we bend the cylinder such that the top base is in a different plane, say, a slant plane, then the top base is still a circle lying in its own plane (which is now tilted), so it's still planar. Similarly, the bottom base is in the original plane. Therefore, both bases remain planar, just in different planes. But the question is: Must any bending leave the bases planar? So, even if the bases are in different planes, they are still planar. Therefore, the answer would be yes, the bases must remain planar, but not necessarily in the same plane.

But wait, the problem statement says ""the bases"". In the original cylinder, both bases are in the same plane. If we bend it, can we have both bases in different planes while remaining planar? For example, if we deform the cylinder into a helicoidal surface, the top and bottom circles lie in their respective planes, which might be parallel or not. If we shear the cylinder such that the top is tilted, then the top base is in a different plane, but still planar. So, in this case, both bases are planar, but not necessarily in the same plane. Therefore, the answer might be yes, they must remain planar, but not necessarily in the same plane.

But wait, the problem says ""leave the bases planar"". So, does ""planar"" mean that they lie in a plane, regardless of the plane? Then, even if they are in different planes, they are planar. So, the answer would be yes. However, is there a bending where one of the bases becomes non-planar?

Wait, but the original cylinder's bases are circles. If we bend the cylinder, can we make one of the bases have a non-planar shape? For example, if we could somehow twist the cylinder so that the base becomes a helical shape, but that would require the base to be a curve, not a surface. Wait, the bases are circles, and in the bending, they must remain circles because the bending is an isometry. Wait, no. The bending is an isometry on the surface, but the boundary curves are allowed to deform as long as the surface distances are preserved. Wait, actually, the boundary curves are part of the surface. If the surface is bent isometrically, the boundary curves can deform, but their lengths must be preserved. Wait, the original bases are circles with circumference 2Ï. If we bend the cylinder, can the boundary curves become non-circular while preserving their length? For example, can they become ellipses or something else?

Wait, but in the bending, the entire surface is deformed isometrically. The boundary curves are part of the surface. If we take the cylinder and bend it, for example, into a different cylinder with the same height but with a different radius, but that would require stretching the surface, which isn't allowed. Alternatively, if we bend it into a cone, but cones have a different topology. Alternatively, if we twist the cylinder, the boundary curves remain circles but in different planes. For example, if you twist the cylinder, the top and bottom circles are still circles, just rotated relative to each other in their respective planes. Therefore, their shapes are preserved as circles, hence planar.

Wait, but what if we bend the cylinder in such a way that the boundary curves become non-planar? For example, if we could somehow curve the cylinder into a shape where the boundary curves are helices. But a helix is a curve in 3D space, but the boundary of the surface M_t must be a submanifold with boundary. So, the boundary of M_t is a 1-dimensional manifold, which can be a curve. A helix is a curve, but is it a submanifold with boundary? Wait, the boundary of M_t is the set of points where the surface M_t meets its boundary. If M_t is a cylinder with a helical twist, then its boundary would be two circles, each of which is a helix? Wait, no. The boundary of a cylinder is two circles, but if the cylinder is twisted, the boundary curves are still circles, just in different planes. Wait, no. If you have a cylinder parameterized by Î¸ and z, and you apply a twisting transformation, then the boundary at z=0 would be a circle in the original plane, and the boundary at z=1 would be a circle rotated by some angle. So, they are still circles in their respective planes. Therefore, the boundary curves remain planar.

But is there a way to bend the cylinder so that the boundary curves become non-planar? For example, if we could somehow make the boundary curves into something like a spiral. Wait, but a spiral is a curve, but the boundary of the surface M_t has to be a 1-dimensional submanifold with boundary. Wait, no, the boundary of a submanifold with boundary is a 1-dimensional submanifold (without boundary). Wait, the problem states that Î[MÃ{t}] is a submanifold with boundary. So, the boundary of M_t is a 1-dimensional submanifold, which could be a circle. But if we could make the boundary curves non-planar, like a helix, but a helix is a curve in 3D space, but is it a submanifold with boundary? Wait, a helix is a curve without boundary. Wait, the boundary of M_t is the set of points where the surface ends. If M_t is a cylinder, the boundary is two circles. If M_t is a cone, the boundary is a single circle. But in our case, the original M has two boundary circles, so M_t must also have two boundary circles. Therefore, M_t must be a surface with two boundary circles. Therefore, it must be a cylinder or something topologically equivalent. But as we saw earlier, cones have only one boundary circle, so they are out. Therefore, M_t must be a cylinder, which has two boundary circles. Therefore, the only possible isometric deformations are other cylinders. Therefore, the bases, which are circles, must remain circles, hence planar. Therefore, the answer is yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

Wait, but is there another developable surface with two boundary circles? For example, a cylinder can be deformed into a different cylinder. But a cylinder is the only developable surface with two boundary circles. So, if the bending is an isometry, then M_t must be a cylinder, hence the bases are circles in their respective planes, which are planar.

But wait, a cylinder can be deformed into a different cylinder by twisting it, but the bases remain planar. Therefore, the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar. Therefore, the final answer is yes.

But let me check this again. Suppose we have a cylinder with height 1 and radius 1. If we bend it along its axis, say, by rotating it, the surface remains a cylinder, and the bases are still in their original planes. If we twist the cylinder, the bases remain planar, just rotated relative to each other. If we shear the cylinder, making it a slant cylinder, the bases are still planar but in different planes. However, in all these cases, the bases remain planar. Therefore, yes, the bases must remain planar.

Alternatively, could we have a bending where the bases are not planar? For example, if we could somehow curve the cylinder such that the bases are not in a plane. But given that the bending is an isometry, and the original bases are circles in a plane, would that be possible?

Wait, perhaps not. Because the metric on the cylinder is such that the boundary circles have length 2Ï. If we try to deform the cylinder into a non-planar shape, the boundary circles would have to maintain their length. However, if the bases were non-planar, they would have to be curves in 3D space with length 2Ï. But in such a case, the surface M_t would not be a submanifold with boundary, or the boundary would not be a 1-dimensional manifold. Wait, no. The boundary of M_t is still two circles, even if they are helices or something else. Wait, but a helix is a curve, but can it be the boundary of a submanifold? The boundary of a submanifold is a subset where the submanifold ends. If we have a cylinder parameterized by Î¸ and z, and we twist it such that the boundary circles are helices, then each boundary circle is a helix. But a helix is not a planar curve. However, is such a surface a submanifold with boundary?

Wait, if we take the cylinder and apply a bending that twists it helically, then the surface is a helicoidal cylinder. The boundary circles are helices. But a helicoidal cylinder is still a submanifold with boundary, with boundary being the two helices. However, the problem states that M_t must be a submanifold with boundary. So, if we can have such a surface, then the bases (helices) are not planar. But are helices considered planar? No, they are curves in 3D space. Therefore, this would be a case where the bases are not planar. But is such a bending allowed?

Wait, but if the bending is an isometry, then the metric on the surface is preserved. However, the original cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature. The helicoidal cylinder also has zero Gaussian curvature, so it is a developable surface. Therefore, such a bending is possible. Therefore, in this case, the bases (helices) are not planar. Therefore, the answer would be no, it is not necessary for the bases to remain planar.

But wait, this contradicts my previous reasoning. So, where is the mistake here?

The key point is whether the boundary curves can be non-planar. If the bending is an isometry, but the boundary curves are allowed to be non-planar, then the answer would be no. However, the problem statement says that M_t is a submanifold with boundary. A submanifold with boundary in RÂ³ can have a boundary that is a non-planar curve, like a helix. Therefore, such a surface is allowed. Therefore, the bases do not have to remain planar. Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, this contradicts the earlier thought that the only developable surfaces with two boundary circles are cylinders. However, a helicoidal cylinder also has two boundary circles, which are helices. Therefore, this is a developable surface with two boundary circles, which are non-planar. Therefore, the answer is no.

But then why in my earlier reasoning did I think that cones are out because they have a different topology? Because cones have a single boundary circle, while the original cylinder has two. Therefore, cones cannot be part of the bending. However, helicoidal cylinders have two boundary circles, but they are non-planar. Therefore, such a bending is possible, and the bases (helices) are not planar. Therefore, the answer is that it is not necessary for the bases to remain planar.

But wait, is a helicoidal cylinder considered a submanifold with boundary? Yes, because it is a surface in RÂ³ whose boundary is the two helices, which are 1-dimensional submanifolds (without boundary). Therefore, such a surface is allowed.

Therefore, the answer should be no, it is not necessary for the bases to remain planar.

But then why did I think earlier that the only isometric deformations are cylinders? Because developable surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature and two boundary circles can be cylinders or helicoidal cylinders. Therefore, the bases can be planar or non-planar. Therefore, the answer is no.

But this contradicts some intuition. Let me verify.

Suppose we have a cylinder parameterized by Î¸ and z, where Î¸ â [0, 2Ï], z â [0, 1]. If we apply a bending that maps z to z + f(Î¸), where f(Î¸) is a function that causes the cylinder to twist, then the surface becomes a helicoidal cylinder. The boundary circles at z=0 and z=1 would be mapped to helices in space. For example, if f(Î¸) = kÎ¸, then the surface becomes a helicoid. The boundary circles would be helices with radius 1 and pitch 2Ïk. These helices are not planar. Therefore, such a bending is allowed, and the bases are not planar.

Therefore, the answer is no, the bases do not have to remain planar.

But wait, the problem says ""the bases"". In the original cylinder, the bases are circles in the plane. After bending, the bases are helices. So, they are not planar. Therefore, such a bending is possible, and the answer is no.

But this contradicts my initial thought that only cylinders are possible. So, where is the mistake here?

The mistake was assuming that the only developable surfaces with two boundary circles are cylinders. However, helicoidal cylinders also have two boundary circles but are not planar. Therefore, the answer should be no.

But let me check the problem statement again. It says that Î[MÃ{t}] is a submanifold with boundary. A helicoidal cylinder is a submanifold with boundary, with boundary being the two helices. Therefore, this is allowed. Therefore, the answer is no.

However, I need to confirm whether such a bending is actually an isometry. If we twist the cylinder into a helicoidal cylinder, is that an isometry? Let's compute the metric.

On the original cylinder, the metric is given by dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². If we parameterize the helicoidal cylinder as X(Î¸, z) = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + kÎ¸), then the induced metric would be dÎ¸Â² + (dz + k dÎ¸)Â² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ² + 2k dÎ¸ dz + kÂ² dÎ¸Â². Comparing to the original metric dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ², this is different unless k=0. Therefore, twisting the cylinder introduces a cross term, which means that the metric is not preserved. Therefore, such a twisting is not an isometry. Therefore, my previous reasoning was wrong.

Therefore, can we twist the cylinder isometrically? If the metric is not preserved, then such a bending is not an isometry. Therefore, the only isometric bendings are those that preserve the metric, which would restrict the possible deformations.

Therefore, how can we isometrically bend the cylinder? One way is to move it in space without stretching, like translating or rotating. For example, if we translate the cylinder along some direction, the bases remain in parallel planes. If we rotate the cylinder, the bases remain in the same planes but rotated. However, these do not change the shape of the bases, which remain planar. Another way is to shear the cylinder, but as we saw earlier, shearing would change the metric unless done in a specific way.

Wait, but if we can find an isometric bending that maps the cylinder to another cylinder with different orientation, then the bases would remain planar but in different planes. For example, imagine rotating the cylinder around one of its axes. The surface remains a cylinder, the metric is preserved, and the bases are still circles in their respective planes. Therefore, such a bending is allowed, and the bases remain planar.

However, if we try to shear the cylinder such that the bases are in non-parallel planes, we have to preserve the metric. Is such a shearing possible?

Suppose we perform an isometric bending that maps the original cylinder to a slant cylinder. Let's parameterize this. Letâs say we want to map the original cylinder to another cylinder where the axis is tilted. For example, letâs take a cylinder with axis along the x-axis, and tilt it so that the axis is along a line in the xy-plane. However, maintaining the metric would require that the surface remains a cylinder. If we tilt the cylinder without stretching, the surface remains a cylinder, and the metric is preserved. In this case, the top and bottom bases are circles lying in planes that are not parallel. For example, the original base at z=0 is in the xy-plane, and the top base at z=1 is in a plane tilted by some angle. However, in this case, the distance between points on the surface is preserved, but the extrinsic shape is a slant cylinder. However, in this case, the bases are still circles in their respective planes, hence planar. Therefore, such a bending is possible, and the bases remain planar but in different planes.

Therefore, even if the bases are in different planes, they are still planar. Therefore, the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar. However, if we can find a bending where the bases are not planar, then the answer is no. But according to the previous analysis, such a bending is not possible because any isometric bending would preserve the metric, which requires the bases to remain circles in planar surfaces. Wait, but the surface can be embedded in space in such a way that the bases are in non-parallel planes but still planar.

Wait, but if the bases are circles in different planes, they are still planar individually. The question is whether the bending must leave them planar. Since they can be in different planes, but still planar, then the answer is yes, they must remain planar, but not necessarily in the same plane. However, the problem statement says ""the bases"", which in the original cylinder are both in the same plane. If the bending allows them to be in different planes, does that count as ""leaving the bases planar""? Yes, because each base is a planar circle. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But earlier, I thought that a helicoidal cylinder would have non-planar bases, but that was incorrect because such a bending is not an isometry. Therefore, the only possible isometric bendings are those that preserve the metric, which would include rotating or shearing the cylinder in a way that the bases remain planar. Therefore, the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar.

Therefore, after going through this reasoning, I think the answer is yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

The manifold \\( M \\) is a cylinder defined by \\( M = \\{(\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta), z) : \\theta \\in [0, 2\\pi], z \\in [0, 1]\\} \\). A bending of \\( M \\) is a smooth map \\( \\Gamma: M \\times [0, 1] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^3 \\) such that each \\( M_t = \\Gamma[M \\times \\{t\\}] \\) is a submanifold with boundary, \\( \\Gamma(m, 0) = m \\), and each \\( M_t \\) is isometric to \\( M \\).

Key points:
1. **Isometry and Developable Surfaces**: An isometry preserves the intrinsic metric (Gaussian curvature). Since \\( M \\) has zero Gaussian curvature, \\( M_t \\) must also be a developable surface (zero Gaussian curvature). Developable surfaces include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables.

","Okay, let's try to tackle this problem about bending the manifold M. So, M is given as the set of points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is between 0 and 2Ï, and z is between 0 and 1. That sounds like a cylinder, right? A right circular cylinder with radius 1, extending from z=0 to z=1. The question is whether any bending of M must leave the bases (which are the circles at z=0 and z=1) planar. A bending here is a smooth map Î that satisfies three conditions: each M_t is a submanifold with boundary, the identity at t=0, and each M_t is isometric to M.

First, let me make sure I understand the definitions. A submanifold with boundary in R^3 would mean that each M_t is a surface that is smooth except possibly along the boundary, which in this case would be the circles at z=0 and z=1. The isometry condition means that the bending preserves the intrinsic geometry of the cylinder; lengths and angles on the cylinder are preserved during the bending. So, even though the cylinder might be deformed in 3D space, its metric structure remains the same.

The question is about whether the bases (the two circles at z=0 and z=1) must remain planar under such a bending. So, is it possible to bend the cylinder in such a way that these bases are no longer lying on a plane, or does the isometry force them to stay planar?

Let me think about the properties of the cylinder. The cylinder M has zero Gaussian curvature because it's a developable surface. Wait, no, actually, a cylinder is a developable surface, but its Gaussian curvature is zero. Developable surfaces can be isometrically embedded in R^3 without being flat, but they must be developable, meaning they can be unfolded into a plane without stretching. But in this case, the cylinder is already a developable surface. So, when we bend it, we have to maintain its intrinsic metric, which is the same as the metric of a flat cylinder (since it's a cylinder without any curving in the Î¸ direction).

So, if we bend the cylinder, we can't stretch or compress it, but we can twist it or curve it in some way that preserves the distances along the cylinder. However, the problem is about whether the bases have to stay planar. Let's consider what would happen if we tried to bend the cylinder so that the bases are not planar.

One thought is that if you twist the cylinder, the bases might not stay planar. But wait, twisting a cylinder would preserve its isometry, right? For example, if you take a cylinder and twist it around its axis, the metric (distance along the cylinder) remains the same, but the vertical lines (along z) become helices. However, in this case, the vertical lines would no longer be straight lines in the embedding, but since the isometry only preserves the intrinsic metric, the extrinsic geometry can change. However, the bases would still be circles, but maybe not lying on a plane?

Wait, hold on. If you twist the cylinder, the two circles (the bases) are still in the same plane? Or do they get twisted into some other shape?

Wait, no. If you have a cylinder and you twist it, the top base would still be at z=1, but the positions of the points on the base would be rotated. For example, if you twist the cylinder by an angle Ï as you go from z=0 to z=1, then the point (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0) would map to (cos(Î¸ + Ï), sin(Î¸ + Ï), 1). But this is just a rotation of the base, so the base remains a circle in the same plane. Wait, but actually, if you twist the cylinder, the vertical lines become helices, but the bases are still circles. However, if you twist the cylinder, the two bases can be rotated relative to each other. So, in that case, the bases are still planar, but they are rotated with respect to each other. However, the question is whether the bases must remain planar. So, in this case, they do remain planar but are rotated. So, that seems acceptable.

But maybe there's a different kind of bending where the bases are not planar. For example, if you could somehow bend the cylinder into a different shape where the bases are not lying on a plane. However, given that the cylinder is a developable surface, and it's being bent isometrically, maybe the only way to do this is by twisting or bending it into another developable surface. But developable surfaces can be cones, cylinders, or tangent developables. Wait, but cones have a different structure. For example, a cone is developable, but it has a cone point where the Gaussian curvature is not zero. However, our original cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. So, can we bend the cylinder into a cone? Let me think.

If you want to bend the cylinder into a cone, you would have to curve it such that the two circles (bases) are now on the surface of a cone. However, a cone has a singular point (the apex) where the curvature is concentrated. But our cylinder's isometry must preserve the intrinsic metric, which has zero curvature everywhere. So, if we try to map the cylinder to a cone isometrically, the problem is that the cone has a cone point with non-zero curvature, which would not be allowed because the original cylinder has zero curvature everywhere. Therefore, such a bending would not be possible, since the isometry requires preserving the curvature properties.

Wait, but maybe there is a way to bend the cylinder into a different developable surface. For example, a tangent developable surface is a developable surface formed by the tangent lines of a curve. But again, such surfaces have a different structure. For instance, a tangent developable to a space curve would have a boundary that's the curve itself, but in our case, the cylinder's boundaries are the two circles. So, maybe we can't form a tangent developable from a cylinder with isometric bending.

Alternatively, perhaps the only isometric bends of the cylinder are other cylinders or cones, but cones are excluded because of the curvature. So, maybe the only possible isometric bends are other cylinders, possibly twisted.

But in that case, the bases would still be planar. Wait, but a twisted cylinder's bases are still planar, just rotated relative to each other. So, in that case, the bases remain planar. However, if we could bend the cylinder into a different surface where the bases are not planar, but still isometric, then the answer would be no. But I need to check whether such a bending is possible.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar. Let me try to think of a proof.

Since the cylinder is isometrically bent, the intrinsic metric is preserved. The intrinsic metric of the cylinder is such that the distance between two points depends only on the angular difference and the vertical difference. So, if we can find a way to embed the cylinder in R^3 such that the bases are not planar, while preserving the intrinsic metric, then the answer is no. Otherwise, it's yes.

But maybe the planarity of the bases is enforced by the isometry. Let's consider the concept of developable surfaces. A developable surface is one that can be isometrically embedded into R^3 without stretching, and it must have zero Gaussian curvature. The cylinder is a developable surface, and so is a cone (but with a singularity). However, in our case, the cylinder is smooth everywhere, so we can't have a cone as a bending because of the singularity.

Alternatively, perhaps the only developable surfaces with two circles as boundaries are cylinders. Wait, but a tangent developable is a developable surface with a boundary which is a curve, but in our case, the boundaries are two circles. So, maybe the only developable surface with two circular boundaries is a cylinder.

Wait, but if you take a cylinder and fold it into a cone, you get a cone with a boundary which is a single circle, but in our problem, the boundaries are two circles. So, perhaps the only way to have two circular boundaries is to have a cylinder. Therefore, any isometric bending of the cylinder must result in another cylinder, hence the bases remain planar.

But is that true? Let's think. Suppose we have two circles in space that are not coplanar. Can we glue them together with a cylindrical surface? For example, imagine two parallel circles, but not in the same plane. Wait, but if they are not coplanar, the distance between them would vary along the cylinder. However, in our case, the cylinder must be a developable surface with zero Gaussian curvature. If the two circles are not coplanar, then the surface connecting them would have non-zero curvature, which would violate the isometry.

Wait, actually, if the two circles are not coplanar, the surface connecting them would have to be a developable surface, but the only developable surfaces between two circles are cylinders or cones. But cones have a singular point, so they can't be isometrically bent from a smooth cylinder. Therefore, the only possible isometric bending is another cylinder, possibly twisted, which keeps the bases planar but rotated.

Therefore, the answer might be yes, the bases must remain planar.

But let me check for possible exceptions. For example, consider a cylinder that's been bent into a ""twisted"" cylinder, but still has the bases planar. Wait, but in such a case, the bases are still in the same plane, just rotated. So, they are planar. Alternatively, if we could somehow shear the cylinder so that the bases are not planar, but I think that would require stretching the cylinder, which is not allowed by the isometry.

Another approach: consider the Gauss map. The Gauss curvature is zero for the cylinder, and since the bending is an isometry, the Gauss curvature must remain zero. The only surfaces in R^3 with zero Gaussian curvature are developable surfaces, which are either cylinders, cones, or tangent developables. But tangent developables have a boundary that's a space curve, and cones have a singular point. Since our cylinder is smooth and has two circular boundaries, the only possible developable surface is another cylinder. Therefore, the bases must remain planar.

Wait, but tangent developables can also have boundaries that are circles. For example, a tangent developable to a circle in space. But in that case, the boundary is the circle itself, and the surface is a helicoid or something similar. Wait, no, a tangent developable to a circle in space is a cone. Because if you take a circle in space and take the tangent developable, you get a cone with the circle as its boundary. But in our case, we have two boundaries, not one. So, maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe a cylinder can be bent into a different cylinder with non-planar bases. Wait, but if the bases are non-planar, how can the surface be a cylinder? A cylinder in R^3 is a surface where each generator is a straight line. If the bases are not planar, then the generators are not parallel, so it's not a right circular cylinder, but maybe an oblique cylinder or something else. However, in such a case, the surface would not have zero Gaussian curvature. Wait, actually, a skew cylinder (oblique cylinder) does have zero Gaussian curvature. Wait, is that true?

Let me recall that the Gaussian curvature is the product of the principal curvatures. For a right circular cylinder, the principal curvatures are 0 and 1/r, so Gaussian curvature is 0. For an oblique cylinder, the principal curvatures might still be 0 and 1/r, hence Gaussian curvature remains 0. Wait, but actually, the principal curvatures depend on the shape. Let me check.

Suppose I have an oblique cylinder, where the generators (the straight lines) are not perpendicular to the base. For example, imagine a cylinder where the top base is shifted relative to the bottom base, but the surface remains made of straight lines. However, such a surface would not be a developable cylinder in the usual sense. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If the generators are straight lines, but the bases are not parallel or not congruent, then it's not a standard cylinder. However, if the surface is generated by translating a line along another line (the axis), then it's a right cylinder. If the axis is not perpendicular to the base, it's an oblique cylinder. But in that case, the Gaussian curvature might not be zero.

Wait, actually, the Gaussian curvature of an oblique cylinder is still zero. Because even though the cylinder is oblique, it is still a developable surface, hence Gaussian curvature zero. However, the problem is whether such a cylinder can have its two bases not lying on parallel planes. For example, if the axis of the cylinder is not straight. Wait, no, the axis has to be a straight line for it to be a cylinder. If the axis is curved, then it's not a cylinder. So, an oblique cylinder has a straight axis but not perpendicular to the base. However, in such a case, the two bases would still lie on parallel planes, but the cylinder is tilted. Wait, but even if the cylinder is tilted, the bases are still circles on parallel planes, but maybe not aligned. But the question is whether the bases must lie on planes. If the cylinder is an oblique cylinder, the bases are still on parallel planes, just rotated relative to each other. So, they are planar.

Alternatively, can we have a cylinder where the two bases are not on parallel planes? For example, a cone-like shape, but with two circular bases. However, a cone has a single base, and the other ""base"" is a point (the apex). So, that's not applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe a cylinder where the axis is a curve, but then it's not a cylinder anymore. So, perhaps the only way to have a cylinder with two circular bases is to have it be a right circular cylinder or a tilted one with parallel bases. In both cases, the bases are planar.

Therefore, if the bending must result in a developable surface with zero Gaussian curvature, and with two circular boundaries, then the only possibility is another cylinder, possibly tilted, but with the bases lying on parallel planes. Hence, the bases must remain planar.

But wait, suppose we take the cylinder and bend it into a helicoidal shape. Wait, a helicoid is a minimal surface, but it has negative curvature. However, our cylinder must remain developable with zero curvature. So, a helicoid is not developable. Therefore, such a bending would not be possible.

Alternatively, consider a cylinder that is bent along its length, so that it's like a spiral. But such a surface would have non-zero curvature.

Wait, maybe another approach: use the fact that the cylinder is a flat surface. Since it's a developable surface, it can be isometrically embedded in R^3 as a cylinder. Any isometric bending would correspond to another embedding of the same flat cylinder, which must be another developable surface. However, since the cylinder has two boundary circles, the only developable surfaces with two boundary circles are cylinders. Therefore, the bending must result in another cylinder, keeping the bases planar.

But let's think about the work of Gauss and the Theorema Egregium, which states that the Gaussian curvature is invariant under isometric bending. Since the original cylinder has zero curvature, the bent surface must also have zero curvature, hence must be a developable surface. Therefore, the only possible isometric bends are other developable surfaces with the same boundary. Since the boundaries are two circles, the only possibility is another cylinder, which would have the bases lying on parallel planes. Hence, the bases must remain planar.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, any bending of M must leave the bases planar.

But wait, to confirm, let's consider specific examples. Suppose we have a cylinder and we twist it by some angle as we go along its height. This is called a twisted cylinder. The two bases are still circles, but they are rotated with respect to each other. However, they are still lying on parallel planes. So, they are planar. Another example: if we could somehow shear the cylinder, but shearing would require stretching or compressing, which is not allowed. So, shearing is out of the question. Alternatively, can we make the cylinder into a ""twisted"" version where the bases are not planar? I don't think so, because twisting doesn't change the planarity of the bases, just their orientation.

Alternatively, consider a cylinder that is bent into a polyhedral shape, but since the cylinder is a smooth surface, the bending must also be smooth. A polyhedral cylinder would have edges and vertices, which are not allowed here because the bending must result in a smooth submanifold with boundary.

Therefore, after considering all these possibilities and recalling the properties of developable surfaces and isometric embeddings, it seems that any isometric bending of the cylinder must result in another cylinder, which has planar bases. Therefore, the bases must remain planar under any bending of M.

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether any bending of the manifold M must leave the bases planar. Let me start by understanding what M is. The manifold M is defined as the set of points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is between 0 and 2Ï and z is between 0 and 1. So this is like a cylinder, right? It's a right circular cylinder with radius 1, height 1, and the height parameter is z. The bases of this cylinder are the circles at z=0 and z=1.

A bending of M is a smooth map Î from MÃ[0,1] to âÂ³ such that three conditions hold. First, each Î[MÃ{t}] is a submanifold with boundary, which means that for every t, the image of M under Î at time t is a smooth surface with boundary in âÂ³. Second, at time t=0, the map Î is the identity, so the cylinder remains the same. Third, for each t, the map from M to M_t (the image at time t) is an isometry. That means that the bending preserves the intrinsic geometry of M; distances and angles on the surface are preserved during the bending.

So the question is, must any such bending necessarily leave the bases of the cylinder (the circles at z=0 and z=1) planar? In other words, can we bend the cylinder in such a way that these bases become non-planar, or is it impossible?

Let me think about what an isometry of a cylinder entails. The cylinder is a developable surface, which means it can be flattened into a plane without stretching or tearing. The intrinsic geometry of the cylinder is flat, so the Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere. When you bend a developable surface isometrically, you can only do so by rolling it or unrolling it. But if you roll it, the edges (the bases) might change shape.

Wait, but in this case, the cylinder is a right circular cylinder. If we roll it up, does the base stay planar? Hmm. Let me recall that when you roll a cylinder into a cone, the base becomes a circle, but the lateral surface becomes conical. However, rolling a cylinder into a cone would not be an isometry because the Gaussian curvature of the cone is not zero everywhere (except at the apex). But in our case, the bending must be an isometry, so the Gaussian curvature must remain zero everywhere on the surface. Therefore, the only isometric deformations (bendings) of a cylinder with zero Gaussian curvature are the isometric transformations that preserve the flatness. So, perhaps the only way to bend the cylinder is by rolling it rigidly, but that would keep the bases planar?

Wait, but if you roll the cylinder into a cone, that introduces curvature, so that's not allowed here. So maybe all isometric bendings of a cylinder must be such that the surface remains developable, hence flat. Therefore, perhaps the bases must remain planar.

But maybe there's another way. Let me think. If we bend the cylinder along its axis, like twisting it. Wait, but twisting a cylinder without stretching would require the surface to stay developable. However, twisting would preserve the flatness but change the orientation of the surface. However, the bases might still remain planar. For example, if you twist the cylinder, the circles at z=0 and z=1 would still be in their original planes, just rotated. So their planar nature is preserved.

Alternatively, if you bend the cylinder into a different shape, say, a helical cylinder, but again, that might not be possible without introducing curvature. Since the Gaussian curvature must remain zero, the surface must remain flat. Therefore, any isometric bending must be a rigid motion preserving the flatness.

Wait, but rigid motions are isometries of the entire space, but here we are considering isometries of the surface. So maybe we can have non-rigid isometries of the surface into itself, but keeping the surface developable. However, in 3D space, if the surface is developable and isometrically embedded, then the only isometric mappings are the rigid motions. Wait, is that true?

Wait, no. For example, you can roll a cylinder into a different cylinder with the same height and circumference, but that's just a rigid motion. Wait, no, rolling a cylinder into another cylinder with the same circumference would be a rigid motion. Wait, but if you roll a cylinder into a cone, that's not an isometry because the cone has curvature. But maybe there are other ways.

Wait, actually, in 3D, if you have a cylinder and you isometrically bend it, you can only roll it into another cylinder or into a plane. Because the surface must stay developable. So, if you roll it into another cylinder, the height remains the same, but the radius changes? Wait, no. If you roll it into another cylinder, you have to keep the circumference the same, so the radius can't change. Wait, the circumference is 2Ï, so the radius must remain 1. So rolling the cylinder into another cylinder would just be a rotation around its axis, which is a rigid motion. Therefore, such a bending would not change the shape of the cylinder; it's just a rotation in space, so the bases remain planar.

Alternatively, if you unroll the cylinder into a plane, that's an isometry, but in this case, the bases become straight lines on the plane, so they are not circles anymore. Wait, but the problem says that the bending must map M to a submanifold with boundary. If you unroll it into a plane, the image would be a rectangle in the plane, which is a submanifold with boundary. But the original bases were circles; when unrolled, they become straight lines. So in this case, the bases are no longer planar as circles but as lines. However, in the problem statement, the bases are the boundaries of the cylinder. Wait, but the cylinder's boundary is two circles at z=0 and z=1. If you unroll it into a plane, those circles become straight lines. But the question is whether the bases must remain planar. If unrolling is allowed, then the bases become non-planar (as lines), which are planar, but they are not circles. Wait, lines are planar, but they are not circles. So does the problem consider ""planar"" as being a circle? The problem states ""bases planar"", so if the bases are circles, then when you unroll them into lines, they are still planar, but their shape changes.

Wait, the problem says ""must any bending of M leave the bases planar"". If by planar they mean that the bases lie in a plane, then yes, because any submanifold with boundary in 3D space must have its boundary lying in some plane if it's a planar curve. Wait, but if the bases are unrolled into lines, then they are straight lines, which are planar. But in the original cylinder, the bases are circular. So if unrolling is allowed, then the bases can become non-circular planar curves, but they are still planar. However, the problem might be asking whether the bases must remain as circles, or just as planar curves.

Looking back, the problem states ""must any bending of M leave the bases planar"". The bases are the boundaries of M, which are circles at z=0 and z=1. The term ""planar"" here probably refers to being a subset of a plane. So if the bending maps the bases to planar curves, then yes, they must remain planar because the entire surface is a submanifold with boundary, and the boundary must lie in the tangent plane of the surface at the boundary. Wait, no, the boundary of a submanifold with boundary in 3D doesn't have to lie in a plane. For example, a cylinder's boundary is two circles, but if you bend the cylinder into a cone, the boundary becomes a single circle (but that's not an isometry). Wait, but in our case, the bending must preserve the isometry, so the Gaussian curvature must remain zero. Therefore, the surface must remain developable. So the boundary must lie in a plane? Wait, not necessarily. For example, a cylinder is developable and its boundaries are circles, which are planar. But if you take a finite cylinder, like a circular cylinder between two parallel planes, then the boundaries are circles. But if you have a different developable surface, like a cone (but cones are not flat), so they have non-zero curvature. So perhaps the only way to have a bounded developable surface with boundary is a cylinder or a tangent developable. Wait, a tangent developable is a surface generated by the tangent lines to a curve, like a cylinder around a curve. But in our case, the cylinder is a right circular cylinder.

Wait, maybe the key here is that the cylinder is a flat surface, and any isometric bending must preserve this flatness. Therefore, the surface must remain flat, hence developable. For a developable surface, the boundary curves must lie in a plane. Is that a theorem? Wait, no, a developable surface can have boundaries that are not planar. For example, a cylinder is developable, and its boundaries are circles, which are planar. A tangent developable, like the surface of a cone, is not flat (except at the apex), so that's not our case. Wait, but a cylinder is flat, so maybe any isometric bending of a cylinder must preserve the flatness, so the surface remains flat, hence a cylinder again. Therefore, the boundaries would remain circles, which are planar.

Alternatively, if you roll the cylinder into another cylinder, but the height remains 1, so the circumference must stay 2Ï, so the radius stays 1. Therefore, rolling the cylinder rigidly around its axis would just rotate it, keeping the bases as circles in planes perpendicular to the axis. So their planarity is preserved.

But what if you bend the cylinder into a different shape? Wait, but if you have to keep the surface flat, the only way is to have it as a cylinder or a plane. But since the cylinder is a closed surface with boundaries, you can't unroll it into a plane unless you cut it, but the problem states that the bending must map M to a submanifold with boundary. If you unroll it into a plane, the image would be a rectangle with boundary consisting of the two straight lines (the bases) and the other two sides. But the original bases were circles. So in this case, the bases become straight lines, which are planar, but they are not circles. So does the problem consider ""planar"" as being in a plane, regardless of the shape? Then yes, they are still planar. But if ""planar"" refers to being a circular planar curve, then no. The problem statement just says ""planar"", so I think it refers to lying in a plane, not necessarily being a circle.

But the original bases are circles, which are planar. The question is whether any bending must leave them planar. If the bending can turn them into non-planar curves, then the answer is no. But if all bendings must keep them planar, then the answer is yes.

Wait, but in the case of the cylinder, since it's a developable surface, and the bending must preserve the isometry (hence the flatness), the boundary curves must lie on a plane. Wait, is that a theorem? Let me recall that for a developable surface, the Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere, and the boundary curves must lie on a plane if the surface is bounded and closed. Wait, but a cylinder is bounded between two planes (z=0 and z=1), and its boundaries are circles. If you have another developable surface, say, a cylinder over a different curve, but still with zero curvature.

Wait, but maybe there's a result that states that the only closed developable surfaces with two boundary components are cylinders. If that's the case, then any bending must result in another cylinder, hence the bases must remain circles, hence planar. But I need to verify this.

Alternatively, perhaps the key is that the total curvature of the boundary must be considered. For a cylinder, the boundary consists of two circles, each with total curvature 2Ï (the integral of the curvature over the boundary). If you bend the cylinder into another shape, the total curvature of the boundaries must remain the same. If the bending were to make the boundaries non-planar, their total curvature would have to change, but since the isometry is preserved, the total curvature should remain the same. Wait, but total curvature is related to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. For a surface with boundary, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem states that the integral of the Gaussian curvature over the surface plus the integral of the geodesic curvature over the boundary equals 2Ï times the Euler characteristic. For a cylinder (which is topologically a rectangle, Euler characteristic 0), the integral of the Gaussian curvature is zero (since it's flat), and the integral of the geodesic curvature over the boundary is zero (since the boundary is a circle, the geodesic curvature is zero if it's a planar circle). Wait, but the geodesic curvature of a circle on a cylinder is not zero. Wait, actually, on the cylinder, the circles are geodesic if they are the ""height"" circles (z=constant), but the helical circles are not. Wait, maybe I'm confused here.

Let me think again. On the cylinder, the geodesics are the straight lines when unrolled, which correspond to helices on the cylinder. The circles at constant z are not geodesic; their geodesic curvature is non-zero. Wait, the geodesic curvature of a circle at a height z on the cylinder can be calculated. Let's parameterize the cylinder as (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z). The tangent vectors are â/âÎ¸ = (-sinÎ¸, cosÎ¸, 0) and â/âz = (0,0,1). The metric is dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². The geodesic curvature of the circle z=constant is given by the curvature of the circle when projected onto the cylinder. Wait, but maybe I need to compute it properly.

The geodesic curvature k_g of a curve on a surface is given by k_g = (d/ds)(T) â N, where T is the tangent vector to the curve and N is the normal vector to the surface. For the circle z=constant, parameterized by Î¸, the tangent vector is T = â/âÎ¸ = (-sinÎ¸, cosÎ¸, 0). The normal vector to the cylinder is N = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0). The derivative of T with respect to arc length s is (dT/dÎ¸)(dÎ¸/ds). Since ds = dÎ¸, dT/ds = dT/dÎ¸ = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0). Then k_g = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0) â (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0) = -cosÂ²Î¸ - sinÂ²Î¸ = -1. So the geodesic curvature is -1. Therefore, the integral of the geodesic curvature over the boundary circle would be â«k_g ds = â«-1 ds = -length of the circle. But the length of the circle is 2Ï*1 = 2Ï. So â«k_g ds = -2Ï.

Applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem: â«K dA + â«k_g ds = 2ÏÏ, where Ï is the Euler characteristic. For the cylinder, Ï=0. So 0 + (-2Ï) = 0, which holds. Wait, but this seems like a problem because the left-hand side is -2Ï, which is not equal to 0. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in the geodesic curvature calculation.

Wait, perhaps the geodesic curvature is not -1. Let me recalculate. The formula for geodesic curvature is k_g = (d/ds)(T) â N, where N is the unit normal vector to the surface. On the cylinder, the normal vector is (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0), which is a unit vector. The tangent vector T is (-sinÎ¸, cosÎ¸, 0). The derivative of T with respect to arc length s is indeed (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0), because dT/dÎ¸ = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0), and ds = dÎ¸. Therefore, dT/ds = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0). Then the dot product with N is (-cosÎ¸)(cosÎ¸) + (-sinÎ¸)(sinÎ¸) + 0*0 = -cosÂ²Î¸ - sinÂ²Î¸ = -1. So k_g = -1. Then â«k_g ds = -2Ï. But Gauss-Bonnet says 0 + (-2Ï) = 2Ï*0 â -2Ï = 0, which is not true. That's a contradiction. So where's the mistake?

Ah, maybe I used the wrong formula. Wait, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for surfaces with boundary states that â«K dA + â«k_g ds = 2ÏÏ, where the integral of k_g ds is over the boundary. For the cylinder, which is a topological annulus, the Euler characteristic Ï is 0. So 0 + â«k_g ds = 0. But according to my calculation, â«k_g ds = -2Ï. That's a problem. Therefore, my calculation must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the geodesic curvature is not -1. Let me think differently. The geodesic curvature is the curvature of the curve as measured on the surface. For a circle on the cylinder, which is a cylinder of radius 1, the geodesic curvature can be calculated as follows. The circle is parameterized by Î¸, with z constant. The tangent vector is T = (-sinÎ¸, cosÎ¸, 0). The normal vector to the curve is in the direction of the cylinder's normal, which is (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0). The curvature of the curve in 3D space is the magnitude of dT/ds. Since dT/ds = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0), which has magnitude 1. So the curvature in 3D is 1. However, the geodesic curvature is the component of this curvature that is perpendicular to the surface. The normal component of the curvature is k_g = curvature * cos(Î±), where Î± is the angle between the curve's normal and the surface normal. Wait, maybe this is more complicated.

Alternatively, using the formula that relates the geodesic curvature to the extrinsic curvature in 3D. The relationship is k_g = k - (dN/ds) â T, where k is the curvature of the curve in 3D, and (dN/ds) is the derivative of the normal vector to the curve. Wait, perhaps this is getting too complicated. Let me check another source.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because the cylinder is a developable surface, and the geodesic curvature of its boundary is related to the angle of the boundary in the developed plane. When you unroll the cylinder into a plane, the boundary circles become straight lines. The geodesic curvature on the cylinder should correspond to the curvature of the curve in the plane. But a straight line in the plane has zero curvature, so if the developed boundary is a straight line, then the geodesic curvature should be zero. But earlier calculation suggested -1. That's a contradiction.

Wait, no. When you unroll the cylinder into a plane, the boundary circles become straight lines, but the original geodesic curvature is not zero. Wait, the geodesic curvature is a measure of how much the curve deviates from being a geodesic. On the cylinder, the circles at constant z are not geodesic, as their geodesic curvature is non-zero. However, when you unroll the cylinder, the boundary becomes a straight line, which is a geodesic in the plane, hence has zero geodesic curvature. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my previous calculation.

Let me recast the problem. On the cylinder, the metric is dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². The geodesic equations can be solved, and the geodesics are helices or straight lines when unrolled. The circles at constant z are not geodesic. The geodesic curvature of a curve on the cylinder can be computed using the formula for a surface of revolution. For a surface of revolution parameterized by (Î¸, z) with radius r(z), the geodesic curvature of a parallel at height z is given by k_g = (dr/dz) / sqrt(1 + (dr/dz)^2). In our case, the cylinder has r=1, so dr/dz=0. Therefore, k_g = 0 / 1 = 0. Wait, that contradicts the previous calculation. Wait, no, maybe that formula is for a different parameterization.

Wait, perhaps the formula for geodesic curvature on a surface of revolution is different. Let me recall that on a surface of revolution, the geodesic curvature of a parallel at height z is given by k_g = (dr/dz) / sqrt(1 + (dr/dz)^2). But in our case, since the cylinder is straight, dr/dz=0, so k_g=0. But this contradicts the earlier calculation where k_g=-1. Clearly, something is wrong here.

Wait, perhaps the formula is derived under a different parameterization. Let me check. Suppose the surface is parameterized by (Î¸, z), where Î¸ is the angle and z is the height. The first fundamental form is dsÂ² = (r(z))Â² dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². The geodesic curvature of a parallel (z constant) is then k_g = (dr/dz) / sqrt(1 + (dr/dz)^2). For a cylinder, r(z)=1, so dr/dz=0, hence k_g=0. But this contradicts my previous result where I calculated k_g=-1. Therefore, there must be an error in my initial calculation.

Wait, perhaps the confusion comes from the difference between the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature. The geodesic curvature is an intrinsic property, but the calculation in 3D space might be different. Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different approach. Let's use the formula for geodesic curvature in terms of the connection. For a curve on a surface, the geodesic curvature is the norm of the projection of the acceleration vector of the curve onto the tangent plane of the surface.

Given a curve Î³(s) on the surface, with tangent vector T(s), the acceleration vector is dÂ²Î³/dsÂ². The geodesic curvature is then the norm of the projection of this acceleration onto the tangent plane. For the circle at z=constant, parameterized by Î¸, we have Î³(Î¸) = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z). The tangent vector is T = (-sinÎ¸, cosÎ¸, 0). The acceleration vector is dÂ²Î³/dsÂ² = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0) (since ds = dÎ¸). The projection of this onto the tangent plane is just (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0), because the tangent plane at each point is the plane orthogonal to the cylinder's normal vector (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0). Therefore, the geodesic curvature is the norm of (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0), which is 1. But according to the formula from the surface of revolution, it should be zero. This is a contradiction.

Wait, this suggests a fundamental misunderstanding. Let me check with another method. The geodesic curvature can also be computed using the formula:

k_g = (d/ds)(T) â N

where N is the unit normal vector to the surface. For the cylinder, N = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0). The derivative of T with respect to s is (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0). Taking the dot product with N gives (-cosÎ¸)(cosÎ¸) + (-sinÎ¸)(sinÎ¸) + 0*0 = -cosÂ²Î¸ - sinÂ²Î¸ = -1. So k_g = -1. But according to the surface of revolution formula, it should be zero. This is conflicting.

Wait, perhaps the formula for geodesic curvature on a surface of revolution is different. Let me check a reference. According to some sources, on a surface of revolution, the geodesic curvature of a parallel at height z is given by k_g = (dr/dz) / sqrt(1 + (dr/dz)^2). For a cylinder, since dr/dz=0, this gives k_g=0. But according to the direct calculation, it's -1. This inconsistency suggests an error in my reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe the formula is for the geodesic curvature when the surface is parameterized differently. Let me try to compute it using the connection coefficients. The metric on the cylinder is dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². The connection coefficients are Î^Î¸_Î¸ = 0, Î^Î¸_z = 0, Î^z_Î¸ = 0, Î^z_z = 0. Therefore, the geodesic equations are dÂ²Î¸/dsÂ² = 0 and dÂ²z/dsÂ² = 0. So the geodesics are straight lines in the parameter space, which correspond to helices on the cylinder. Therefore, the geodesic curvature of a curve on the cylinder is not zero. For a circle at constant z, the curve is not a geodesic, but its geodesic curvature can be computed as follows:

The acceleration vector in 3D is Î³''(s) = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0). The projection onto the tangent plane is Î³''(s) itself, because the tangent plane is spanned by T and the other tangent vector (which is along z-direction, but for the circle, dz/ds=0). Wait, actually, for the circle at constant z, the curve is only moving in Î¸, so the tangent vector is T = â/âÎ¸. The other tangent vector is â/âz, but for the curve, dz/ds=0. Therefore, the acceleration vector is entirely in the tangent plane. Therefore, the geodesic curvature is the norm of Î³''(s), which is 1. So k_g = 1. But this contradicts the previous calculation using the dot product with N, which gave k_g = -1.

This is confusing. Let me try to reconcile this. The geodesic curvature is an intrinsic property, but depending on the orientation of the normal vector, the sign can change. If the normal vector is pointing inward or outward, the sign of the geodesic curvature flips. In our case, the normal vector N = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0) points radially outward from the cylinder. The acceleration vector Î³''(s) = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0) points radially inward. The dot product of Î³''(s) and N is (-cosÎ¸)(cosÎ¸) + (-sinÎ¸)(sinÎ¸) = -1. Therefore, if we take the magnitude of the projection, it's 1, but the sign depends on the orientation. If we consider the normal vector pointing outward, then the geodesic curvature is -1. If we take the inward normal, it's +1.

But in the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, the integral is over the boundary, and the sign depends on the orientation of the normal. If the normal is outward, then the integral would be negative, but Gauss-Bonnet says it should be zero. This suggests that perhaps the formula for k_g is different. Wait, maybe I need to consider the absolute value. But Gauss-Bonnet requires the integral, so if k_g is -1, then â«k_g ds = -2Ï, which would contradict Gauss-Bonnet unless there's a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the error is in the parameterization. Let me use a different parameterization where the normal vector points inward. If N = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0), then the dot product would be positive 1. Then â«k_g ds = 2Ï, and Gauss-Bonnet would give 0 + 2Ï = 2Ï*0, which is still not correct. Hmm.

This is getting too complicated. Maybe I should look up the geodesic curvature of a cylinder. According to some references, the geodesic curvature of a circle on a cylinder (not a geodesic) is indeed not zero. For example, on a cylinder of radius R, the geodesic curvature of a parallel at height z is k_g = (R') / (sqrt(1 + (R')Â²)), where R is the radius function. For a cylinder, R is constant, so R' = 0, hence k_g = 0. But this contradicts the direct calculation. So there must be a mistake in my understanding.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for a surface of revolution with varying radius, but a cylinder has constant radius. Therefore, the formula is not applicable here. Alternatively, maybe the confusion is between the geodesic curvature on the surface and the curvature in 3D space. The curvature in 3D space for the circle is 1, but the geodesic curvature is different.

Wait, let's think differently. If I unroll the cylinder into a plane, the circle becomes a straight line. In the plane, the geodesic curvature of a straight line is zero. Therefore, when unrolled, the geodesic curvature of the circle on the cylinder must be zero. But this contradicts the previous calculation. Therefore, there must be an error in how I'm calculating the geodesic curvature.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that when parameterizing the cylinder, the parametrization is not compatible with the unrolling. Let me try using arc length parameterization for the circle. The circle at z=constant has length 2Ï. If I parameterize it by s = Î¸, then ds = dÎ¸. The tangent vector is T = (-sinÎ¸, cosÎ¸, 0), and the acceleration vector is Î³''(s) = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0). The projection of this onto the tangent plane is the same vector, so the geodesic curvature is the magnitude of this vector, which is 1. But when unrolled, the same curve is a straight line with curvature zero. This suggests a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the geodesic curvature is not the same as the curvature in 3D space. The geodesic curvature measures how much the curve deviates from being a geodesic on the surface. On the cylinder, a straight line when unrolled is a geodesic, but a circle is not. Therefore, the geodesic curvature should be the difference between the 3D curvature and the normal curvature. The formula is k_g = k - k_n, where k is the curvature in 3D, and k_n is the normal curvature. For a cylinder, the normal curvature k_n = 0 because the normal vector to the cylinder is constant along the surface. Therefore, k_g = k - 0 = k. Therefore, the geodesic curvature of the circle on the cylinder is 1, which matches the direct calculation. But then why does Gauss-Bonnet give a problem?

Wait, Gauss-Bonnet says that â«K dA + â«k_g ds = 2ÏÏ. For the cylinder, K=0, Ï=0, so 0 + â«k_g ds = 0. But if k_g=1, then â«k_g ds = 2Ï*1 = 2Ï, which is not zero. Contradiction again.

This suggests that my calculation of k_g is wrong. Maybe I need to recall that the geodesic curvature is defined with a sign depending on the orientation. If the normal vector is pointing inward, then k_g is positive, and if outward, negative. If I take the normal vector pointing outward, then k_g = -1, and â«k_g ds = -2Ï, which is still not zero. If I take the inward normal, k_g = 1, â«k_g ds = 2Ï. Neither satisfies Gauss-Bonnet.

This is perplexing. Perhaps I need to check the orientation of the normal vector. The Gauss-Bonnet theorem requires the normal vector to be consistently oriented, say, outward. If the boundary is oriented consistently with the surface's outward normal, then the integral should satisfy Gauss-Bonnet. However, for the cylinder, the boundary is two circles, each with outward normal pointing away from the cylinder. Therefore, when computing â«k_g ds, if the normal is outward, the integral should be -2Ï. But Gauss-Bonnet says it should be zero. This suggests that either the theorem is applied incorrectly or there's a mistake in the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe the cylinder is not a closed surface but has boundary. The standard Gauss-Bonnet theorem for surfaces with boundary includes the integral over the boundary. However, a cylinder is a bordered surface, and its Euler characteristic is 0. But according to my calculations, the integral doesn't match. Therefore, I must have made a mistake.

After struggling with this, perhaps I should accept that the geodesic curvature of the circle on the cylinder is indeed 1, leading to a contradiction in Gauss-Bonnet. This might indicate a deeper issue with my understanding. Alternatively, perhaps the cylinder does not satisfy the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in this way because it's a non-compact surface? Wait, no, the cylinder is compact with boundary.

Wait, no, a cylinder between z=0 and z=1 is a compact surface with boundary. The Euler characteristic is 0. So Gauss-Bonnet should hold. But according to the calculation, â«K dA + â«k_g ds = 0 + (-2Ï) = -2Ï â  0. This suggests an error.

Upon checking, I realize that the geodesic curvature should be zero for a cylinder. The error must be in my previous calculations. Let me try a different approach. If I unroll the cylinder into a plane, the boundary circles become straight lines. In the plane, the geodesic curvature of a straight line is zero. Therefore, the geodesic curvature of the circle on the cylinder must be zero when considering the developed plane. Therefore, my previous calculations must be wrong.

Wait, but when unrolled, the cylinder becomes a rectangle with boundary consisting of two straight lines (the original circles) and two vertical lines. The geodesic curvature of the straight lines in the plane is zero. Therefore, the geodesic curvature of the circles on the cylinder must be zero. This suggests that my earlier calculation of k_g = -1 is incorrect.

This confusion indicates that I need to find a reliable way to compute the geodesic curvature of the circle on the cylinder. Let me refer to a standard reference or textbook. According to do Carmo's ""Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces"", the geodesic curvature of a curve on a surface is given by k_g = Â±(d/ds)(e_f), where e_f is the unit tangent vector to the curve. For a cylinder, the calculation should be as follows:

Parameterize the cylinder as X(Î¸, z) = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z). The circle at z=constant is X(Î¸, z0) with Î¸ â [0, 2Ï]. The tangent vector to the curve is X_Î¸ = (-sinÎ¸, cosÎ¸, 0). The normal vector to the surface is N = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0). The derivative of X_Î¸ with respect to Î¸ is X_Î¸Î¸ = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0). The geodesic curvature is then the projection of X_Î¸Î¸ onto the tangent plane: X_Î¸Î¸ - (X_Î¸Î¸ â N)N = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0) - (-1)(cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0) = (-cosÎ¸ + cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸ + sinÎ¸, 0) = (0, 0, 0). Therefore, the geodesic curvature is zero.

Wait, that can't be right. If the projection is zero, then the geodesic curvature is zero, which matches the unrolled case. But this contradicts the earlier calculation where the projection was non-zero. What's happening here?

Ah, I think I see the mistake. In the calculation using the projection formula, I need to ensure that the acceleration vector is subtracted by its normal component. The correct formula for geodesic curvature is k_g = ||(Î³''(s) - (Î³''(s) â N)N)||. For the circle on the cylinder, Î³''(s) = (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0). The normal component is (Î³''(s) â N)N = (-1)(cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0). Therefore, the geodesic curvature is ||Î³''(s) - (-1)(cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0)|| = ||(-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0) + (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0)|| = ||(0, 0, 0)|| = 0. Therefore, the geodesic curvature is zero. This matches the unrolled case.

So where did I go wrong earlier? I think I forgot to subtract the normal component. The acceleration vector in 3D is Î³''(s), but the geodesic curvature is the norm of the projection of Î³''(s) onto the tangent plane. Therefore, it's ||Î³''(s) - (Î³''(s) â N)N||. In this case, since Î³''(s) â N = -1, the projection is Î³''(s) - (-1)N = Î³''(s) + N. But Î³''(s) is (-cosÎ¸, -sinÎ¸, 0), and N is (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0). Adding them gives zero. Therefore, the geodesic curvature is zero. This resolves the contradiction with Gauss-Bonnet, because now â«k_g ds = 0, and Gauss-Bonnet holds: 0 + 0 = 0.

This means that the geodesic curvature of the circle on the cylinder is zero. Therefore, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem is satisfied. This makes sense because when unrolled, the circle becomes a straight line with zero geodesic curvature.

This was a critical mistake in my initial calculation. I forgot to subtract the normal component of the acceleration vector. Therefore, the geodesic curvature of the circle on the cylinder is indeed zero. This implies that the boundary curves have zero geodesic curvature, meaning they are geodesic on the surface. Wait, but the circles on the cylinder are not geodesic when we consider the cylinder's geometry. However, when unrolled, they become straight lines, which are geodesic in the plane. Therefore, the geodesic curvature on the cylinder must be zero, aligning with the unrolled case.

Given this correction, let's return to the original problem. If the bending must preserve the isometry, then the Gaussian curvature remains zero everywhere on the surface. Therefore, the surface must remain developable. For a developable surface with two boundary components (the bases of the cylinder), the only possible shape is another cylinder. This is because a developable surface with two boundary circles must be a cylinder. If the bending were to create a different shape, like a cone, it would introduce curvature, which is not allowed. Therefore, the only isometric bendings of the cylinder are those that preserve its cylindrical shape, hence keeping the bases as circles in parallel planes.

However, there's another possibility: rolling the cylinder along its axis. For example, imagine taking the cylinder and twisting it while keeping the surface flat. This would result in a different cylinder, but still a cylinder. The bases would remain circles, but their orientation in space might change. However, they are still planar. Alternatively, if you roll the cylinder into a helical shape, but this would not preserve the flatness of the surface. Therefore, the only smooth isometric bendings that preserve the flatness are those that keep the surface as a cylinder, hence the bases must remain planar circles.

Additionally, consider that if you attempt to bend the cylinder into a shape where the bases are not planar, the surface would no longer be developable, as it would require introducing curvature. Since the bending must preserve the isometry, the surface must remain flat, which restricts the shape to another cylinder. Therefore, the bases cannot be bent into non-planar curves; they must remain planar.

Another approach: consider the fundamental theorem of surfaces. For a surface with zero Gaussian curvature, the only surfaces possible are cylinders, planes, and tangent developables. However, a tangent developable is a surface generated by tangent lines to a curve, which is not closed. Since our cylinder is closed and bounded between two planes, the only possible isometric bendings are cylinders. Therefore, the bases must remain planar.

Moreover, the total curvature of the boundaries must remain the same. Since the original boundaries have total curvature zero (as their geodesic curvature is zero), any bending must preserve this. If the bases were bent into non-planar curves, their total curvature would have to remain zero, which would require them to be geodesic curves in the new surface. However, since the surface must remain flat, the only geodesic curves are straight lines when unrolled. Therefore, the bases must remain planar.

In summary, through multiple approachesâconsidering the developability of the surface, the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and the properties of isometric bendingsâit appears that any bending of the cylinder must preserve the flatness, hence the bases must remain planar circles. Therefore, the answer should be yes, any bending of M must leave the bases planar.

","Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a manifold M which is like a cylinder, right? It's defined by all points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is between 0 and 2Ï, and z is between 0 and 1. So, it's a cylinder with radius 1, extending from z=0 to z=1. 

A bending of M is a smooth map Î from M Ã [0,1] to âÂ³ with three conditions. First, for each t, Î[M Ã {t}] is a submanifold with boundary. Second, when t=0, Î is the identity map. Third, for each t, the map from M to M_t is an isometry. So, bending here means deforming the cylinder through a family of isometric surfaces, right? So, each M_t is an isometric copy of the original cylinder, but maybe twisted or something?

The question is: Must any bending of M leave the bases planar? The bases here are the top and bottom circles at z=0 and z=1. So, does every isometric deformation of the cylinder keep those circles lying in planes?

Hmm, let's think. First, what's an isometry on a cylinder? The cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature because it's developable. So, by the Gauss theorem, any isometric transformation must preserve the Gaussian curvature. Since the original cylinder has zero curvature, each M_t must also have zero curvature. Therefore, each M_t must be a developable surface. Developable surfaces are ones that can be flattened into a plane without stretching, like cylinders, cones, or tangent developables.

Wait, but the cylinder is a specific type of developable surface. If we can bend the cylinder isometrically, are the only possibilities other cylinders or cones? Because cones also have zero Gaussian curvature, right? A cone with a certain radius and height can be isometric to a cylinder if they have the same length around the base. But does a cone have a boundary? The original cylinder has boundaries at z=0 and z=1. If we bend it into a cone, would that affect the boundaries?

Wait, but the problem states that each M_t must be a submanifold with boundary. So, if we bend the cylinder into a cone, the cone would have a singular point at the tip, which might not be a smooth submanifold. Also, the boundaries z=0 and z=1 would need to remain as curves. Hmm, maybe that's not possible. Alternatively, maybe the only smooth developable surfaces with boundary that are isometric to a cylinder are other cylinders. Because cones would have a point where the geometry changes, which might break the smoothness required for the submanifold with boundary.

But wait, the problem allows for any bending, as long as it's smooth and the image is a submanifold with boundary. So, perhaps we can have a cone as a bending? Let's see. Suppose we take the cylinder and bend it into a cone. For example, if we roll the cylinder into a cone by identifying the two circular ends. But in that case, the cone would have a singular point at the tip, and the original boundaries z=0 and z=1 would now meet at the tip. However, the problem states that each M_t must be a submanifold with boundary. If the cone has a singular point, then it's not a smooth submanifold anymore. So maybe that's not allowed. Therefore, the only possible isometric deformations are other cylinders?

Wait, but cylinders can also be twisted. For example, a helicoidal cylinder, where the mapping is a combination of rotation and translation along the z-axis. But in that case, the cylinder remains a cylinder, just twisted. However, the bases (z=0 and z=1 circles) would still lie in planes, right? Because twisting doesn't change the fact that each horizontal cross-section is a circle in a plane. So, even if the cylinder is twisted, the top and bottom circles are still in planes. So, in that case, the bases remain planar.

But maybe there's another way to bend the cylinder where the bases are not planar? Let's think. If we take the cylinder and bend it into a cone, but as we saw earlier, that might not be possible due to the singular point. Alternatively, maybe a tangent developable? A tangent developable is a surface formed by moving a straight line along a curve, like a cone. But again, similar issues with singularities.

Wait, another thought. The cylinder is flat, so any isometric transformation must preserve the flatness. Therefore, the cylinder can be bent into another flat surface. The only flat surfaces in 3D are planes, cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. But cones and tangent developables are not flat in the sense that they have a different angular structure. Wait, no. Wait, a cylinder is flat because it's developable, but a cone is also developable. However, a cone has a different angular structure. For example, if you cut a cone along a generator and flatten it, you get a sector of a circle. So, the cone is not flat in the Euclidean sense, but it is flat in the intrinsic geometry. So, maybe a cone can be isometric to a cylinder?

Wait, but how? If we have a cylinder of circumference 2Ï and height 1, and a cone with base circumference 2Ï and height h, can they be isometric? The area of the cylinder is 2Ï*1 = 2Ï. The area of the cone's lateral surface is Ï*r*s, where r is the base radius and s is the slant height. For the base circumference, 2Ïr = 2Ï, so r=1. The slant height s is sqrt(rÂ² + hÂ²) = sqrt(1 + hÂ²). The lateral area is Ï*1*sqrt(1 + hÂ²). For the areas to be equal, Ï*sqrt(1 + hÂ²) = 2Ï, so sqrt(1 + hÂ²) = 2, so 1 + hÂ² = 4, so hÂ² = 3, h = sqrt(3). So, a cone with height sqrt(3) and base radius 1 would have the same lateral surface area as the cylinder. But are they isometric? I don't think so. Because the metric on the cylinder is different from the metric on the cone. On the cylinder, the metric is flat, with coordinates (Î¸, z). On the cone, the metric is flat but has a different angular coordinate. When you cut the cone along a generator, you get a sector of a circle with angle Î¸ = 2Ï - Î±, where Î± is the apex angle. So, the cone's metric is flat but with a different angular coordinate. Therefore, they are not isometric as Riemannian manifolds because the angles don't match.

Therefore, a cylinder cannot be isometrically deformed into a cone without changing the angular coordinate. Therefore, the only isometric deformations are other cylinders. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, maybe a cylinder can be bent into another cylinder with a different radius or height while keeping the same circumference? Wait, if you increase the radius, the height would have to decrease to maintain the same circumference. But the circumference is 2Ï, so if you have another cylinder with circumference 2Ï, its radius is still 1, so it's the same cylinder. Unless you twist it, but twisting doesn't change the radius or the height. So, maybe the only way is to twist it, but that doesn't affect the bases being planar.

Wait, but the problem says ""must any bending of M leave the bases planar?"" So, if we can find a bending where the bases are not planar, then the answer is no. But if all possible bendings must leave the bases planar, then the answer is yes.

But how can we have a bending where the bases are not planar? Let's think. Suppose we take the cylinder and bend it such that the top and bottom circles are not in horizontal planes. For example, maybe we can lift the top circle into a different plane while keeping the isometry. But since the cylinder is isometrically bent, the length along the cylinder remains the same. However, if we move the top circle into another plane, the vertical distance between the planes would have to be adjusted to maintain the height. Wait, but the height is fixed by the original cylinder's z-coordinate from 0 to 1. If we bend the cylinder, does the z-coordinate change? Wait, no. The bending is a map Î: M Ã [0,1] â âÂ³. So, for each t, Î(m,t) is a point in âÂ³. The original cylinder has z from 0 to 1, but after bending, the images M_t could have z-coordinates anywhere, depending on the deformation. However, the isometry condition must hold. So, the metric on M is preserved in each M_t.

But the original cylinder's metric is such that the vertical direction (z-axis) is orthogonal to the circular direction (Î¸). If we bend the cylinder, we can twist it, but the vertical direction might not remain orthogonal. Wait, no. The isometry preserves the metric, so the inner product structure must be preserved. Therefore, the vertical direction (which is a vector field on M) must be mapped to a vector field on M_t that preserves the inner product. So, if we twist the cylinder, say by a helical motion, then the vertical direction would have a component along the axis of the helix, but the metric is preserved. Wait, maybe not. Wait, in a helicoidal cylinder, the vertical direction (z-axis) would be mixed with the angular direction (Î¸). But the metric on the cylinder is dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ², so if you twist it, the metric would still be dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ², but the coordinates are now functions of Î¸ and z. Wait, perhaps the isometry allows for twisting, but the vertical direction is still orthogonal to the circular direction in the metric. Therefore, even if you twist the cylinder, the vertical direction remains orthogonal, so the top and bottom circles would still lie in planes that are parallel to the original ones, just rotated around the axis. Wait, but if you twist the cylinder, the top and bottom circles would still lie in planes, but those planes could be tilted with respect to each other. Wait, no. If you have a helicoidal cylinder, the top and bottom circles are still circles in planes. For example, imagine a cylinder that's been twisted so that each point moves along a helical path. The top circle would still be a circle in a plane, just rotated relative to the original. So, the planes of the top and bottom circles would still be parallel, right? Because the z-coordinate is still vertical, even if the cylinder is twisted. Wait, no. Wait, in a helicoidal cylinder, the vertical direction is not purely vertical. For example, if you parameterize the cylinder as (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + aÎ¸), where a is some constant, then the z-coordinate is a function of Î¸. So, in this case, the vertical direction is not purely vertical; it's a combination of z and Î¸. Therefore, the top and bottom circles would not lie in horizontal planes. Wait, but in the original cylinder, the vertical direction is the z-axis. In the twisted cylinder, the vertical direction is a combination of z and Î¸. Therefore, the top and bottom circles would actually lie in planes that are tilted with respect to the original horizontal planes. But the problem states that M is the cylinder with z from 0 to 1, so when we bend it, the images M_t can have points with any z-coordinate. However, the isometry must preserve the metric. So, in this case, twisting the cylinder would not change the metric, but would change the embedding into âÂ³. However, in such a twisted cylinder, the top and bottom circles would not lie in horizontal planes. So, this would be a bending where the bases are not planar.

Wait, but this seems contradictory. If you twist the cylinder, the metric is preserved, but the top and bottom circles are not in horizontal planes. Therefore, such a bending would violate the requirement that the bases remain planar. Therefore, the answer would be no, such a bending exists. Therefore, the answer is no, the bases do not have to remain planar.

But wait, let's check this carefully. Let's parameterize the cylinder as M = {(cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) | Î¸ â [0, 2Ï), z â [0, 1]}. The metric on M is dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². A bending is a smooth map Î: M Ã [0,1] â âÂ³ such that for each t, Î(m, t) is an isometry. So, for each t, the induced metric on M_t is the same as the original metric on M. 

Suppose we define a bending by Î(Î¸, z, t) = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + aÎ¸ t). Wait, but this is a parameterization where the z-coordinate is z + aÎ¸ t. However, this would mean that for each t, the height at a point (Î¸, z) is z + aÎ¸ t. But the original z goes from 0 to 1. So, when t=1, the height at Î¸=0 is z + 0, and at Î¸=2Ï, it's z + 2Ï a. But this would cause a discontinuity unless a=0. Therefore, this parameterization is not valid. Alternatively, maybe a different kind of bending.

Alternatively, think of a helical motion. Let's say we rotate the cylinder around the z-axis while lifting it. For example, define Î(Î¸, z, t) = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + a t Î¸). Wait, but again, similar issue. At Î¸=0, the z-coordinate is z, and at Î¸=2Ï, it's z + 2Ï a t. So, unless a=0, this would create a discontinuity when Î¸ wraps around.

Alternatively, maybe a different approach. Let's think of the cylinder as a product of SÂ¹ and [0,1]. An isometry of M must preserve the product structure? Not necessarily. However, the cylinder is a flat surface, and any isometry of a flat surface is an affine transformation. Wait, but in 3D, the isometry is not necessarily an affine transformation. Wait, but the cylinder is a flat surface, so any isometry must preserve the flatness. So, the isometry can be a combination of rotations, translations, and reflections. But since we're dealing with a cylinder, the isometries would include rotations around the axis, translations along the axis, and helicoidal motions (which combine rotation and translation).

But in our case, the bending is a family of isometric embeddings of the cylinder into âÂ³. So, starting from the identity, we can perform a helicoidal motion, which would twist the cylinder while preserving the metric. In this case, the top and bottom circles would not lie in horizontal planes. For example, consider a helicoidal cylinder where each point is rotated by an amount proportional to its height. This would create a ""twisted"" cylinder where the top and bottom circles are tilted relative to each other. However, in this case, the vertical direction (z) is not purely vertical anymore; it's a combination of the original vertical direction and the angular direction. Therefore, the top and bottom circles would lie in planes that are not horizontal. But the problem states that the bending must be a smooth map such that each M_t is a submanifold with boundary. If the top and bottom circles are not in horizontal planes, does that affect the submanifold structure? The submanifold condition just requires that each M_t is a smooth surface with boundary. The planes of the bases don't necessarily have to be horizontal. For example, a cylinder tilted at an angle would still have its bases in planes, just not horizontal ones. So, in this case, the bases are still planar, but not horizontal. Wait, but the original bases are horizontal. The question is whether the bases must remain planar, not necessarily horizontal. So, planar circles in some plane, not necessarily horizontal. So, even if you twist the cylinder, the bases are still circles lying in planes, just maybe at an angle. Therefore, even in a twisted cylinder, the bases are planar. Wait, but in the helicoidal motion, the vertical direction is not purely vertical. So, the top and bottom circles are not horizontal. But in the embedding, their images would be circles lying in planes that are tilted with respect to the original horizontal planes. Therefore, they are still planar, just not horizontal. So, in this case, the bases are still planar, but in different planes. So, in this case, the answer would be yes, they must remain planar.

But wait, maybe there's a different bending where the bases are not planar. For example, if we can deform the cylinder into a non-planar surface while preserving the metric. But since the cylinder is flat, any isometric deformation must preserve the flatness, so the surface must be a developable surface. Developable surfaces have zero Gaussian curvature, which includes cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. But as we discussed earlier, cones have a singular point, so they might not qualify as smooth submanifolds with boundary. Therefore, the only smooth developable surfaces that can be isometric to the cylinder are other cylinders. Therefore, the bases must remain planar. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, another thought. If you take the cylinder and bend it such that the top and bottom circles are not in the same plane. For example, imagine bending the cylinder into a helicoidal shape where the top and bottom circles are in different planes, but the overall surface is still a helicoid. Wait, but a helicoid is a minimal surface, not a developable surface. The helicoid has negative Gaussian curvature, right? Because it's a surface with zero mean curvature but negative Gaussian curvature. Wait, no. The helicoid actually has zero mean curvature and negative Gaussian curvature. Wait, but our cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature. So, a helicoid cannot be isometric to the cylinder because the curvatures don't match. Therefore, you can't isometrically deform the cylinder into a helicoid. Therefore, such a bending is impossible.

Therefore, all isometric deformations of the cylinder must result in another flat surface, which is a developable surface. The only smooth developable surfaces that are cylinders are other cylinders, possibly twisted. In that case, the bases remain circles in planes. Therefore, the bases must remain planar. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, let's confirm this with some references or theorems. I recall that for developable surfaces, any isometric deformation is a combination of rigid motions and the surface remains developable. Therefore, the cylinder can be isometrically deformed into another cylinder, possibly with a different angle or twist, but still maintaining the developable structure. Therefore, the bases must remain planar. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, wait. Let's think of the cylinder as a flat surface. If we take a cylinder and isometrically deform it into another cylinder with a different radius and height, but same circumference. However, the circumference is 2Ï, so the radius must remain 1. Therefore, the only possible isometric deformations are cylinders with radius 1 but possibly different heights, but the height is fixed by the z-coordinate from 0 to 1. Wait, no, the height can change if we stretch or compress the cylinder, but that would not preserve the metric. Wait, no. If we stretch the cylinder vertically, the metric scales, so it's not isometric. Therefore, the only isometric deformations are those that preserve the metric, which includes rotations, translations, and helicoidal motions. Therefore, the bases must remain in planes, just rotated or tilted. Therefore, they are still planar. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But let me think again. Suppose we have a cylinder and we perform a helicoidal motion, which is a combination of rotation and translation. For example, imagine that as we go up the cylinder, it's also rotated around the axis. In this case, the top and bottom circles would not be in the same horizontal plane. Wait, but they would still be in planes, just tilted. For example, if you have a cylinder that's been twisted so that each point moves along a helical path, the top and bottom circles would still lie in planes that are parallel to each other but rotated by some angle. Wait, no. If you twist the cylinder, the top and bottom circles would actually lie in planes that are separated by the height of the cylinder but rotated relative to each other. However, in this case, the planes are still parallel, just rotated. For example, imagine looking at the cylinder from the top; the top circle is rotated by some angle relative to the bottom circle. However, the top and bottom circles are still in planes that are parallel, just offset in height and rotated. Therefore, the planes of the bases are still planar. Therefore, even in a twisted cylinder, the bases are planar. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But then why does the problem ask ""must any bending of M leave the bases planar?"" If the answer is yes, then the bases must remain planar. But maybe I'm missing something. Let's think of another example. Suppose we take the cylinder and bend it into a cone. Wait, but as we discussed earlier, a cone has a singularity at the tip, so it's not a smooth submanifold with boundary. Therefore, such a bending is not allowed. Therefore, the only possible bendings are other cylinders, which must have their bases in planes. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Alternatively, consider rolling the cylinder into a cone by gluing the top and bottom circles together. But in this case, the cone would have a singular point at the tip, which would make it not a smooth submanifold. Therefore, this is not allowed by condition 1). Therefore, such a bending is not possible. Therefore, all bendings must result in smooth submanifolds with boundary, which can only be cylinders. Therefore, the bases must remain planar. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Another angle: The cylinder is a flat surface with boundary. Any isometric deformation must preserve the flatness. The only flat surfaces in âÂ³ with boundary are cylinders, planes, and cones. Planes are not applicable here because our cylinder has boundaries. Cones have a singular point, which is not allowed. Therefore, the only possible isometric deformations are other cylinders. Therefore, the bases must remain in planes. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, planes are also flat surfaces, but our cylinder is a cylinder, not a plane. So, if we could bend the cylinder into a plane, but a plane is not a submanifold with boundary with the same topology as the cylinder. The cylinder has two boundary circles, while a plane is unbounded. Therefore, the only possible isometric deformations are other cylinders. Therefore, the bases must remain in planes. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Therefore, after considering all these angles and possible deformations, I think the answer is yes. Any bending of the cylinder must leave the bases planar.

","Okay, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have a manifold M which is a cylinder, right? It's defined as all points where (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) with Î¸ from 0 to 2Ï and z from 0 to 1. So, it's like a cylinder standing vertically, with height 1 and radius 1. Then, a bending of M is a smooth map Î that takes M Ã [0,1] into RÂ³, such that:

1. For each t, Î(M Ã {t}) is a submanifold with boundary in RÂ³, denoted M_t.
2. When t=0, Î(m,0) is just m itself.
3. For every t, the map m â Î(m,t) is an isometry between M and M_t.

The question is: Must any bending of M leave the bases planar?

Hmm. So, the bases of M are the circles at z=0 and z=1. The problem is asking whether any isometric bending (i.e., any bending that preserves the intrinsic geometry) of this cylinder must keep these bases as planar circles. Or can they be bent into non-planar shapes?

First, I need to recall what an isometry is. An isometry between two surfaces preserves their intrinsic metric, meaning distances measured along the surface are preserved. So, if you have two surfaces that are isometric, you can't distinguish between them just by measuring lengths of curves on the surface.

The cylinder M is a developable surface, right? Because its Gaussian curvature is zero. Wait, no, actually, a cylinder's Gaussian curvature is zero. Wait, no, wait: the cylinder is a flat surface, so its Gaussian curvature is zero. Because it can be isometrically embedded into the plane (you can just unroll it). So, the cylinder is a developable surface. Therefore, any isometric bending of M must result in another surface with zero Gaussian curvature. So, the bent surface M_t must also be a developable surface.

Now, developable surfaces are those that can be isometrically embedded into RÂ³ and have zero Gaussian curvature. Examples include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables (which are the surfaces generated by tangent lines to a curve). However, cones have a Gaussian curvature of zero only if they are cones over a planar curve? Wait, no. Wait, the Gaussian curvature of a cone is actually zero only along the lines of zero curvature. Wait, no, cones in general have zero Gaussian curvature except at the apex. Wait, maybe I need to recall the exact formula.

The Gaussian curvature K of a surface parametrized by u and v is given by the determinant of the shape operator. For a cone, if you have a cone over a planar curve, the Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere except at the apex where it's undefined. So, cones are developable surfaces. Similarly, cylinders are developable. So, any isometric bending of a cylinder must result in another developable surface, either another cylinder, a cone, or a tangent developable.

But our initial surface M is a cylinder with boundaries (the circles at z=0 and z=1). So, when we bend it, the resulting surfaces M_t must also have boundaries. So, for example, if we bend it into a cone, the boundaries would become circles (or maybe not? Wait, if we have a cone, the base is a circle, but if you have a cone with a certain height and radius, then the base is a circle. But if you have a truncated cone, which is a frustum, then both the top and bottom are circles. But here, our original manifold M is a cylinder between z=0 and z=1, so when we bend it, the boundaries would correspond to the circles at t=0 and t=1 for the bending parameter.

Wait, but the problem states that the map Î must be an isometry between M and M_t for each t. So, not only is the intrinsic metric preserved, but also the boundaries must be preserved in some way. Wait, but the boundaries of M are the circles at z=0 and z=1. When we apply the bending, these boundaries are mapped to some curves in RÂ³, but since the map is an isometry, the lengths of these boundaries must remain the same. So, the circumference of the circles at z=0 and z=1 in M is 2Ï. So, in the bent surface M_t, the boundaries must have the same circumference. However, if we bend the cylinder into a cone, the circumference at the base of the cone would have to be 2Ï. So, for example, if you have a cone with radius r, then its circumference is 2Ïr. So, if we want the circumference to be 2Ï, then r must be 1. So, the cone would have a base circumference of 2Ï, same as the original cylinder. But a cone with base radius 1 and height h has a slant height of sqrt(rÂ² + hÂ²) = sqrt(1 + hÂ²). But how does this affect the surface?

Wait, but if we have a cone with base radius 1 and height h, then the surface area is Ïr(r + sqrt(rÂ² + hÂ²)) = Ï(1 + sqrt(1 + hÂ²)). But the original cylinder's surface area is 2Ï*1*1 = 2Ï. So, unless we adjust the height, the surface area would change. But since we are only considering isometric bending, the area should be preserved. Wait, but isometric bending preserves the intrinsic metric, so areas are preserved. Therefore, if we bend the cylinder into a cone, the area would have to remain the same. So, the surface area of the cone must equal that of the cylinder.

But the cylinder's surface area is 2Ï*1*1 = 2Ï. The cone's lateral surface area is Ïr*s, where s is the slant height. So, Ï*1*sqrt(1 + hÂ²) = 2Ï. Therefore, sqrt(1 + hÂ²) = 2, so 1 + hÂ² = 4, so hÂ² = 3, so h = sqrt(3). Therefore, a cone with base radius 1 and slant height 2 (height sqrt(3)) would have the same surface area as the cylinder. But does such a bending exist?

Wait, but the problem is not about preserving the area, but about preserving the intrinsic metric. So, the area is preserved, but the extrinsic geometry can change. So, isometric bending allows the surface to be embedded in RÂ³ in different ways, but the intrinsic distances are the same. So, theoretically, you could bend the cylinder into a cone as long as the surface areas match. But does such a bending actually exist?

Wait, but in practice, bending a cylinder into a cone would require cutting and rejoining the cylinder, which would not be a smooth map. Because if you try to turn a cylinder into a cone by rolling it, you can't do that smoothly without tearing or overlapping. So, maybe such a bending isn't possible. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe you can have a smooth isometric bending into a cone. Let me think. If you have a cylinder and you want to isometrically bend it into a cone, you need to adjust the extrinsic geometry but keep the intrinsic metric the same. For a cone, the metric is such that the circumference at a certain radius is 2Ï, and the cone has a cone angle. Wait, but a cone with circumference 2Ï is actually a flat cone, which is developable. Wait, no, a cone with circumference 2Ï is a flat cone? Wait, no, a cone with circumference 2Ï is a cone with radius 1, but in 3D space, it's not flat. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature of a cone is zero everywhere except at the apex. So, a cone is a developable surface, similar to a cylinder. So, you can have an isometric embedding of the cylinder into a cone, but the problem is whether such an embedding can be achieved via a smooth bending (i.e., a smooth family of embeddings parameterized by t) that starts at the original cylinder and ends at the cone.

But perhaps the issue is that the original cylinder has two circular boundaries, and the cone would have one circular boundary (the base) and the apex. But the problem states that M_t must be a submanifold with boundary. If we have a cone, the boundary would just be the base circle, but the original M has two boundary circles. So, if we bend M into a cone, we would lose one boundary. But the problem requires that for each t, M_t is a submanifold with boundary, but it doesn't specify that the number of boundaries is preserved. Wait, actually, the original M has two boundary circles. So, if we have a bending that maps M to another surface with two boundaries, then M_t must have two boundaries. So, a cone only has one boundary (the base), unless we have a frustum of a cone, which is a truncated cone, then it has two boundaries. So, a frustum of a cone would have two circles, one at the top and one at the bottom, similar to the cylinder. So, maybe the bending could result in a frustum of a cone.

But is a frustum of a cone an isometric image of a cylinder? Let's see. The cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature, and the frustum of a cone also has zero Gaussian curvature (except at the edges, but since it's a frustum, maybe not). Wait, a frustum is part of a cone, so it's developable. So, a frustum can be isometrically embedded as a surface in RÂ³. But does the frustum have the same circumference on both boundaries as the original cylinder? The original cylinder has both boundaries with circumference 2Ï. If the frustum has two circles, say at radii r1 and r2, then their circumferences would be 2Ïr1 and 2Ïr2. To preserve the isometry, these should be equal to the original circumferences. But the original cylinder has both boundaries with circumference 2Ï, so the frustum would need to have both r1 and r2 equal to 1. But if you have a frustum with both radii equal to 1, then it's actually just a cylinder. So, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the frustum has one boundary with circumference 2Ï and the other with a different circumference. But the problem states that the map must be an isometry between M and M_t for every t. Since M has both boundaries with circumference 2Ï, then M_t must also have both boundaries with circumference 2Ï. Therefore, any frustum that is an isometric image would need to have both boundaries with circumference 2Ï. But if you have a frustum with two circles of radius 1, then it's a cylinder. Therefore, perhaps the only possible isometric bending is another cylinder. Wait, but that can't be right, because the problem is asking whether the bending must leave the bases planar. If all isometric bendings are just cylinders, then yes, the bases are planar. But if you can have other developable surfaces like cones or frustums with planar bases, then maybe not.

Wait, but cones have only one boundary (the base), and frustums have two boundaries. So, if we have a bending that maps the cylinder to a frustum, then the two boundaries must be preserved. So, if the original cylinder's two boundaries are both circles with circumference 2Ï, then the frustum's two boundaries must also be circles with circumference 2Ï. But a frustum with two circles of radius 1 is just a cylinder. Therefore, that's not possible unless you have a different shape.

Alternatively, maybe a tangent developable. A tangent developable is a surface generated by tangent lines to a curve. For example, a cylinder is a tangent developable if you take the generating curve as a straight line. But if you take another curve, like a helix, then the tangent developable would be a helicoid. But a helicoid has zero Gaussian curvature, so it's developable. However, a helicoid is not a cylinder or a cone. But does a helicoid have boundaries? The original cylinder has two circular boundaries. If we bend it into a helicoid, would the boundaries become helices or something else?

But the problem states that M_t must be a submanifold with boundary. A helicoid is a minimal surface, but I'm not sure if it can be bounded. Wait, a helicoid is a non-compact surface, unless you restrict it. But the original M is a compact cylinder with two boundaries. So, a bending would have to map M to another compact surface with two boundaries. Therefore, maybe a frustum is the only possibility, but as we saw, that would require both boundaries to be circles of radius 1, which is the cylinder again. So, perhaps all isometric bendings of the cylinder must result in another cylinder, hence the bases remain planar.

But wait, is that true? Let's think about another example. Suppose we have a cylinder and we want to bend it into a cone. But as mentioned earlier, a cone has only one boundary. So, unless we have a frustum, which has two boundaries, but we saw that a frustum with both boundaries being circles of radius 1 is just a cylinder. Therefore, perhaps the only way to have two boundaries is to have a cylinder or a frustum, but since the frustum would need to have both boundaries with circumference 2Ï, which forces it to be a cylinder.

Therefore, maybe all isometric bendings of M are just cylinders, hence the bases remain planar. Therefore, the answer is yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

But wait, is there a way to have a non-planar bending? For example, if you roll the cylinder into a cone, but as we saw earlier, such a bending would not be possible because the cone only has one boundary. Alternatively, maybe you can have a different developable surface that is compact and has two boundaries. For example, a cylinder with a twist, but I don't know if that's developable.

Wait, a cylinder with a twist is a helicoid, but a helicoid is not compact. To make it compact, you would have to restrict it, but then it might not have two boundaries. Alternatively, maybe a MÃ¶bius strip? But a MÃ¶bius strip has only one boundary, which is a single circle. So, that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe a cylinder with a different height? But the problem states that the height is from z=0 to z=1. Wait, no, the bending is a map Î: M Ã [0,1] â RÂ³. The original height is 1, but when you bend it, the height could change. Wait, but the problem says that the map is an isometry between M and M_t. So, the intrinsic geometry is preserved, but extrinsic geometry can change.

Wait, but if you have a cylinder of radius r, circumference 2Ïr, and height h, then the surface area is 2Ïrh. The original cylinder has r=1 and h=1, so area 2Ï. If you bend it into a cone with base circumference 2Ï, then the base radius is 1, and the slant height s must satisfy Ï*1*s = 2Ï, so s=2. Then the height of the cone is sqrt(sÂ² - rÂ²) = sqrt(4 - 1) = sqrt(3). So, the cone would have height sqrt(3). But does such a bending exist? That is, can you smoothly deform the cylinder into a cone with height sqrt(3) while preserving the intrinsic metric?

I think in theory, yes, because the cone is developable and has the same surface area. However, practically, how would you perform such a bending? You would have to map the cylinder's vertical direction to the cone's slant direction. But since the cylinder's vertical direction is a straight line, when you map it to the cone's slant direction, you're effectively rolling the cylinder into a cone. But rolling the cylinder into a cone would require cutting the cylinder along a generator (a straight line) and then rolling it up, which would create a cone. However, this process is not smooth without tearing; it's a discontinuous process. But in our case, the bending needs to be a smooth map. So, maybe it's not possible.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smooth deformation. Suppose you have a family of surfaces M_t parameterized by t from 0 to 1, where M_0 is the cylinder and M_1 is the cone. For each t, M_t is an isometric surface. But how would this deformation work? If you gradually adjust the extrinsic geometry, keeping the intrinsic metric the same.

Wait, but the problem is not about the existence of such a bending, but whether any bending must leave the bases planar. So, if there exists a bending that deforms the cylinder into a non-planar surface with non-planar bases, then the answer would be no. But if all possible bendings must result in planar bases, then the answer is yes.

So, the key question is: can you isometrically bend a cylinder into a surface where both bases are not planar?

If the only isometric bendings are cylinders, then yes. But if you can bend it into a cone with a planar base but a non-planar top, but wait, a cone has only one boundary. Wait, no, a frustum has two boundaries. But as we saw earlier, a frustum with both boundaries having circumference 2Ï must be a cylinder. So, perhaps not.

Alternatively, maybe a tangent developable. A tangent developable is a surface generated by the tangent lines to a curve. For example, a cylinder can be generated by a straight line moving parallel to itself. If you take a different curve, like a helix, then the tangent developable would be a helicoid. But a helicoid is not compact and doesn't have two boundaries unless you restrict it. So, perhaps not applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe a cylinder with a twist, but as I thought earlier, that would not have two planar boundaries.

Wait, but the problem is about the bases remaining planar. The bases are the two circles at z=0 and z=1. If we bend the cylinder such that these circles are no longer in the same plane, but still have the same circumference, would that be possible?

But in 3D space, a circle has to lie in a plane. So, if you have a circle that is not planar, it's just a curve, but not a circle. So, the boundary of M_t must be a curve with circumference 2Ï, but is it necessarily a planar circle?

Wait, no. A curve with circumference 2Ï doesn't have to be a planar circle. For example, it could be a non-planar curve that is a closed curve with length 2Ï. However, if the surface M_t is a cylinder, then its boundaries are planar circles. If it's a cone, the base is a planar circle. If it's a tangent developable, like a helicoid, then the boundaries might be helices, but helices are not planar.

Wait, but the problem states that the bending is an isometry between M and M_t. So, the boundaries of M are circles with circumference 2Ï, and the boundaries of M_t must also be curves with circumference 2Ï. But are these curves necessarily planar?

In the case of a cylinder, yes. In the case of a cone, the base is a planar circle. In the case of a tangent developable, like a helicoid, the boundary might be a helix, which is not planar. But can a helicoid be a bending of the cylinder?

Wait, a helicoid can be isometrically embedded into RÂ³ and is a minimal surface. However, a helicoid is not a cylinder. So, can you have a smooth family of isometric surfaces starting with the cylinder and ending with a helicoid?

I think not, because the helicoid has a different embedded geometry. The cylinder is a developable surface with zero Gaussian curvature, and the helicoid is also a developable surface with zero Gaussian curvature. However, the helicoid is not a cylinder. So, it's possible that there exists a bending from the cylinder to the helicoid.

But wait, does the helicoid have two boundaries? The standard helicoid extends infinitely, but if we consider a bounded helicoid, say between two helices, then it would have two boundaries (the two helices). However, these boundaries are not circles but helices. But the original cylinder's boundaries are circles. So, to have an isometry, the boundaries must be isometric, i.e., their lengths must match. The circumference of the original boundaries is 2Ï. A helix has a certain circumference, but in the helicoid, the boundaries are helices, which have a certain length depending on the pitch. So, unless the helical boundaries also have length 2Ï, the isometry wouldn't hold.

Wait, but the length of a helix is sqrt( (2Ïr)^2 + (2Ïh)^2 ), where r is the radius and h is the vertical rise over one full revolution. To have this length equal to 2Ï, we need sqrt( (2Ïr)^2 + (2Ïh)^2 ) = 2Ï. So, sqrt(rÂ² + hÂ²) = 1. So, if we choose r and h such that rÂ² + hÂ² = 1, then the helical boundary would have length 2Ï. But in that case, the helicoid is not unbounded; it's a truncated helicoid between two helices with pitch determined by h. However, such a surface would have non-planar boundaries.

But can such a surface be obtained by bending the cylinder? That is, can we smoothly deform the cylinder into this truncated helicoid while preserving the intrinsic metric?

I'm not sure. The key point is whether the helicoid can be obtained as an isometric image of the cylinder. Since both have zero Gaussian curvature, it's possible in theory, but practically, constructing such a deformation might require cutting and rejoining, which might not be smooth.

Another thought: the problem states that the bending must be a smooth map Î: M Ã [0,1] â RÂ³. So, for each t, Î(M Ã {t}) is a submanifold with boundary. If we can find a smooth family of isometric embeddings where the boundaries are non-planar, then the answer would be no. But if every isometric embedding must have planar boundaries, then the answer is yes.

I recall that in differential geometry, a surface with zero Gaussian curvature is called a developable surface, and it can be isometrically embedded into RÂ³. However, the classification of such surfaces is not unique. For example, cylinders, cones, and tangent developables are all developable surfaces. But when you have a compact surface with two boundaries, like a cylinder, the only developable surfaces with two boundaries are cylinders or frustums. However, a frustum must have both boundaries planar circles if the circumferences are preserved, which forces it to be a cylinder. Therefore, perhaps the only isometric bendings of the cylinder are cylinders, hence the bases must remain planar.

Alternatively, maybe there are other developable surfaces with two boundaries that are not cylinders. For example, a cylinder with a twist. But a cylinder with a twist is a helicoid, which is not developable unless the twist is zero. Wait, no, a helicoid is developable. But a helicoid is not a cylinder. So, perhaps a helicoid is a possible bending.

But here's the problem: when you have a cylinder with two planar circular boundaries, if you bend it into a helicoid, the boundaries become helices, which are non-planar. However, the original boundaries have circumference 2Ï, and the helical boundaries would need to have the same circumference. As I calculated earlier, this would require the helical boundaries to have a certain pitch.

But does such a helicoid exist as an isometric image? If so, then the answer would be no, the bases don't have to remain planar. But I need to verify if such a bending is possible.

Another angle: consider the universal cover of the cylinder. The cylinder's universal cover is the plane, and the covering map is (Î¸, z) â (Î¸, z). If you have an isometric bending, then the universal cover would be mapped to another surface, but I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, think about the holonomy of the cylinder. The cylinder has trivial holonomy because it's flat, but when you bend it into a cone, the holonomy changes. Wait, no, a cone has a conical singularity at the apex, so its holonomy is non-trivial. But the problem states that the bending must be smooth, so maybe the cone is not allowed because of the singularity.

Wait, the problem requires that each M_t is a submanifold with boundary. A cone has a boundary (the base) but the apex is a singular point. If M_t is a submanifold with boundary, it must be a smooth submanifold without singularities. Therefore, the cone is not allowed because it has a singularity at the apex. Similarly, a frustum of a cone would have two boundaries (the top and bottom circles) and no singularities, assuming it's a smooth frustum. But as we saw earlier, a frustum with both boundaries having circumference 2Ï would have to be a cylinder. Therefore, perhaps the only possible isometric bendings are cylinders, hence the bases must remain planar.

Alternatively, maybe you can have a bending into a tangent developable without a singularity. For example, a tangent developable is a surface generated by tangent lines to a curve. If you take a curve in RÂ³ and generate a tangent developable, you can get a surface that is developable. If the curve is such that the tangent developable has two boundaries, then it's possible. For example, take a curve that loops around and connects back to itself, creating a closed surface. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think of a cylinder with a different height. Wait, but the height is preserved in the bending? No, the height can change. For example, you can stretch the cylinder vertically, but that would change the height. However, the problem states that the bending must be an isometry, so distances along the surface must remain the same. Therefore, stretching vertically would not be an isometry. Similarly, compressing vertically would change the height but preserve the surface area.

Wait, but the height is part of the extrinsic geometry, not the intrinsic. The intrinsic geometry is determined by the metric on the surface. So, if you have a cylinder with height h, and you bend it into another cylinder with height k, as long as the circumference remains 2Ï, it's an isometry. But the problem states that the bending is a map Î: M Ã [0,1] â RÂ³, so the height can vary as long as the intrinsic metric is preserved. Therefore, you can have a bending that changes the height of the cylinder, but since the height is part of the extrinsic geometry, it can be adjusted. However, changing the height would not affect the planarity of the bases. The bases are still planar circles, just at different heights. So, in that case, the bases are planar.

But the question is whether the bending must leave the bases planar. If you can have a bending where the bases are non-planar, then the answer is no. If not, then yes.

Wait, but if you have a bending that isometrically maps the cylinder to another surface with non-planar boundaries, then those boundaries would have the same circumference as the original planar circles, but they are not planar. For example, a helical boundary. But such a surface would have to be a tangent developable. However, as I thought earlier, constructing such a surface via a smooth bending is non-trivial.

Let me consider the concept of isometric deformations of cylinders. There's a theorem by Gauss that the Gaussian curvature is preserved under isometries. Since the cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature, the bent surface must also have zero Gaussian curvature. Therefore, it must be a developable surface. Developable surfaces are those that can be isometrically embedded into RÂ³ and have zero Gaussian curvature. The only compact developable surfaces with two boundaries are cylinders and frustums. However, a frustum with two planar boundaries must have equal radii to preserve the circumference, which makes it a cylinder. Therefore, perhaps the only possible isometric bendings are cylinders, hence the bases must remain planar.

Alternatively, there's a theorem by Fenchel that states that a closed curve in RÂ³ with total curvature 2Ï must be planar. Wait, is that true? Let me recall. Fenchel's theorem says that for any closed curve in RÂ³, the total curvature is at least 2Ï, and equality holds if and only if the curve is a planar convex curve. Wait, maybe not exactly, but something like that. So, if a closed curve has total curvature exactly 2Ï, then it must be planar and convex. If that's the case, then the boundaries of the cylinder, which are circles, have total curvature 2Ï, so they must be planar. Therefore, any isometric bending would have to preserve the total curvature of the boundaries, hence they must remain planar.

Wait, that seems promising. If the boundaries are closed curves with total curvature 2Ï, then by Fenchel's theorem, they must be planar. Therefore, any isometric bending must leave the boundaries planar.

But wait, Fenchel's theorem applies to curves in RÂ³. The total curvature of a curve is the integral of the curvature over the curve. For a circle, the curvature is constant, 1/r, so the total curvature is 2Ï*1/r. For a planar circle of radius r, the total curvature is 2Ï/r. However, if the radius is 1, then the total curvature is 2Ï/1 = 2Ï. So, if we have a closed curve with total curvature 2Ï, then if it's planar, it's a circle of radius 1. But if it's non-planar, can it still have total curvature 2Ï?

Wait, Fenchel's theorem says that for any closed curve in RÂ³, the total curvature is at least 2Ï, and equality holds if and only if the curve is a planar convex curve. So, if our boundaries have total curvature exactly 2Ï, then they must be planar convex curves. Therefore, if the bending preserves the total curvature of the boundaries, then they must remain planar.

But in our case, the original boundaries are planar circles with total curvature 2Ï. If we have an isometric bending, the boundaries must have the same total curvature, so by Fenchel's theorem, they must be planar. Therefore, any bending must leave the bases planar.

That seems like a solid argument. Therefore, the answer should be yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

But let me verify Fenchel's theorem to be sure. Yes, Fenchel's theorem in 1929 states that for any closed curve in RÂ³, the total curvature is at least 2Ï, and equality holds if and only if the curve is a planar convex curve. Since our boundaries are closed curves with total curvature 2Ï (as they are circles of radius 1), they must be planar. Therefore, any isometric bending that preserves the total curvature of the boundaries must leave them planar.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

","Okay, so I have this problem about a manifold M, which is defined as all points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is between 0 and 2Ï and z is between 0 and 1. So, basically, M is a cylinder, right? It's like taking a circle in the xy-plane and extruding it up along the z-axis from z=0 to z=1. So, it's a right circular cylinder with radius 1 and height 1. 

The problem is asking about bendings of M. A bending is a smooth map Î from MÃ[0,1] to âÂ³ that satisfies three conditions. First, for each t in [0,1], Î[MÃ{t}] is a submanifold with boundary in âÂ³, which is denoted as M_t. Second, when t=0, Î(m,0) is just m, so the bending starts with the original manifold. Third, for each t, the map from M to M_t is an isometry. An isometry preserves the metric, so the intrinsic geometry (like lengths and angles) of M is preserved when we apply the bending to get M_t.

The question is whether any bending of M must leave the bases planar. The bases here would be the two circles at z=0 and z=1. So, even though we can bend the cylinder into different shapes (like a helical cylinder or something), do these bases have to stay in planes, or can they also be bent into non-planar shapes?

Hmm, let's think. The key here is that the bending is an isometry. So, the intrinsic geometry of the cylinder is preserved. But when you isometrically bend a cylinder, you can't stretch or compress it; you just move it around in space. However, the question is specifically about the bases remaining planar.

I know that a cylinder is a developable surface, which means it can be isometrically mapped to a plane. So, if you unroll it, you get a rectangle. But when you isometrically bend it, you're essentially re-rolling it or deforming it in some way without stretching. But can you bend it such that the bases are no longer in planes?

Wait, but the bases are circles. If you bend the cylinder, are their images under the bending still circles? Or can they become something else? For example, if you take a cylinder and twist it, like a helical cylinder, the bases are still circles, right? Because you're just twisting it without stretching or compressing. So, the circles at z=0 and z=1 would still be circles, but their orientation in space would change.

But if you do something more drastic, like bending the cylinder into a cone, but wait, a cylinder can't be isometrically bent into a cone because a cone has a different Gaussian curvature. The cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature everywhere, while a cone has a cone point with curvature concentrated there. So, that's not possible via an isometry. So, maybe the cylinder can only be isometrically bent into another cylinder, or maybe other developable surfaces.

Wait, developable surfaces are those that can be isometrically mapped to a plane, and they have zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. So, any isometric bending of the cylinder must result in another developable surface. The cylinder itself is a developable surface, but so are cones (except at the apex), cylinders, and tangent developables (like the surface of a cone with a straight generatrix).

But in this case, the problem states that M_t must be a submanifold with boundary in âÂ³. So, cones might be excluded because they have a singularity at the apex, which would not be a smooth submanifold. Similarly, tangent developables might not be smooth either. So, perhaps the only possible isometric bendings of the cylinder are other cylinders or something else?

Wait, but a cylinder can also be bent into a helicoid? No, a helicoid has non-zero Gaussian curvature. Wait, no, the helicoid is a minimal surface, but it's not developable. The cylinder is developable, but the helicoid isn't. So, maybe only other cylinders or other developable surfaces can be the result of an isometric bending.

But if you consider that the original cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature, then any isometric bending must also have zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. Therefore, the image M_t must be a developable surface. So, possible candidates are cylinders, cones (but cones are not smooth at the apex), or tangent developables (which are ruled surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature). However, cones and tangent developables might not satisfy the submanifold with boundary condition, because they have singularities.

Therefore, maybe the only possible isometric bendings of the cylinder are other cylinders. But wait, you can also have a cylinder that's been ""twisted"" as I thought before. But twisting doesn't change the fact that the bases are still circles, just rotated. So, in that case, the bases remain planar. But can you twist it such that the bases are not planar?

Wait, but the bases are at z=0 and z=1. If you twist the cylinder, the points at z=0 and z=1 are still in the z=0 and z=1 planes, right? Wait, no. If you twist the cylinder, you're rotating it around the z-axis as you move along the z-axis. Wait, but actually, in the standard cylinder parametrization, the twist would be a helical motion. For example, if you have a cylinder parametrized by Î¸ and z, a twist would be something like Î¸ + kz, where k is a constant. But in that case, the circles at each z are still circles, but their angle Î¸ is shifted by kz. However, the circle at each z is still a planar circle, just rotated. So, the base at z=0 is still the circle in the z=0 plane, and the base at z=1 is still the circle in the z=1 plane, but rotated. So, they remain planar.

But is there a way to bend the cylinder such that the bases are not in planes? For example, if you could somehow ""bend"" the cylinder along its length, making the bases lie on a different surface. But since the cylinder is a developable surface, any isometric bending must preserve the zero curvature. However, if you try to bend it so that the bases are not planar, you might introduce curvature.

Wait, but the Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere, so the surface must remain developable. If you tried to make the bases non-planar, that might require introducing some curvature, which would violate the isometry. Therefore, perhaps the only isometric bendings of the cylinder are those that preserve the planar nature of the bases.

Alternatively, maybe you can have the cylinder bent such that the bases are still circles but lying on non-planar surfaces. Wait, but circles in non-planar surfaces? For example, a circle lying on a sphere is a great circle, but that's a different curvature. But in our case, the Gaussian curvature is zero, so the surface must be developable. So, any developable surface with two circular boundary curves. But the only developable surfaces with two circular boundaries are cylinders, right? Because a cone has a single vertex, so it can't have two circular boundaries. A tangent developable is a ruled surface generated by a moving straight line, but unless it's a cylinder, the boundaries wouldn't be circles.

Therefore, perhaps the only isometric bendings of the cylinder are other cylinders, which in turn have planar bases. Therefore, the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar.

But wait, let's think again. Suppose we have a cylinder M, and we perform an isometric bending. Is there a way to bend it such that the bases are not planar?

Suppose we take the cylinder and bend it into a helical cylinder. As I thought before, the bases are still circles in their respective planes, just rotated. So their planes are still parallel to the original, but each circle is rotated by a certain amount. So, they are still planar.

Another idea: suppose we take the cylinder and bend it such that the axis becomes a helix. But then, the surface would no longer be a cylinder. Wait, but the Gaussian curvature has to remain zero. If you bend the cylinder so that its axis is a helix, then the surface is no longer a cylinder, but a helicoid. However, a helicoid has non-zero Gaussian curvature unless it's a straight helicoid with zero pitch, which is just a plane. Wait, no, a standard helicoid isn't developable. Let's check.

The helicoid can be parametrized as (x cos Î¸ - y sin Î¸, x sin Î¸ + y cos Î¸, z + kÎ¸). The Gaussian curvature of a helicoid is zero everywhere except at the origin, but actually, the helicoid is a minimal surface with zero mean curvature, but its Gaussian curvature is not zero everywhere. Wait, no, the Gaussian curvature of a helicoid is actually zero everywhere? Wait, no, I might be confusing with the plane. Let me compute it.

For the helicoid parametrization, let's consider u and v parameters. Letâs say x = u cos v - w sin v, y = u sin v + w cos v, z = v + k u, where w is another parameter. Wait, maybe better to use a different parametrization. Alternatively, the standard helicoid can be parametrized as (u cos v, u sin v, k v). Then, the first fundamental form would be:

E = 1 + kÂ², F = 0, G = uÂ².

Then, the Gaussian curvature is (eG - fF + gE)/(EG - FÂ²) = (0 - 0 + 0)/( (1 + kÂ²)uÂ² - 0 ) = 0. Wait, so the Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere? Then, the helicoid is a developable surface? But the helicoid is also a minimal surface, but developable surfaces can be non-minimal. Wait, but actually, the helicoid is a ruled surface with zero Gaussian curvature, so it is developable. Hmm, interesting.

So, in that case, the helicoid is a developable surface, and it can be isometrically bent from a cylinder. So, if we take a cylinder and bend it into a helicoid, the Gaussian curvature remains zero. But the bases of the cylinder, which were circles in planes, now become circles on the helicoid. Wait, but the helicoid's boundaries would be two helices, which are not circles. Wait, no, if you take a cylinder and bend it into a helicoid, then the boundaries (at z=0 and z=1) would become helices on the helicoid. But helices are not circles. Therefore, in this case, the bases would no longer be planar. So, does this mean that the answer is no, a bending can make the bases non-planar?

Wait, but hold on. If the cylinder is isometrically bent into a helicoid, then the boundaries of the cylinder (the circles at z=0 and z=1) are mapped to curves on the helicoid. However, these curves are not circles. Therefore, the bases are not planar. But according to the problem statement, the bending must map M to a submanifold with boundary M_t, which is an isometric image. So, in this case, the boundaries would no longer be circles, but helices. Therefore, the bases are not planar. Therefore, the answer would be no, the bases do not have to remain planar.

But wait, this contradicts my previous thought that the only developable surfaces with two circular boundaries are cylinders. But the helicoid has two helical boundaries, not circles. So, perhaps the cylinder can be isometrically bent into a helicoid, which has non-planar ""bases"" (helices). Therefore, the answer is no, the bases do not have to remain planar.

But I need to verify this. Let's think about the mapping. If we take a cylinder M and isometrically bend it into a helicoid, then each point (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) is mapped to (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + kÎ¸). Wait, no, that's a different parametrization. Wait, the standard helicoid parametrization is (u cos v, u sin v, k v). So, if we take the cylinder parametrized by Î¸ and z, then to map it to the helicoid, we can set u = z and v = Î¸. But then, the helicoid would be (z cos Î¸, z sin Î¸, k Î¸). Wait, but this is only valid for z in [0,1] and Î¸ in [0,2Ï]. However, in this case, the boundaries at z=0 and z=1 would be circles in the planes z=0 and z=1, but their z-coordinates are 0 and 1, but their x and y coordinates are (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸) for z=0 and (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸) for z=1. Wait, that's the same as the original cylinder. So, the boundaries are still circles. But the helicoid in this case is just the same as the cylinder, but with a different parametrization. Wait, no, that can't be. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing different parametrizations.

Alternatively, if we take the cylinder and perform a helical twist, such that each point (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) is mapped to (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + kÎ¸). But in this case, the z-coordinate is being increased by kÎ¸ as Î¸ increases. However, this would actually create a helical surface, but the boundaries at z=0 and z=1 would still be circles in the planes z=0 and z=1, but their z-coordinates are fixed. Wait, no, if Î¸ goes from 0 to 2Ï, then for each z, the circle is at z + kÎ¸. Wait, but z is fixed for each circle. Wait, no, if you fix z, then Î¸ varies, so the circle is still at z=0 and z=1, but each point is rotated by kÎ¸. So, the base at z=0 is a circle in the plane z=0, but each point (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0) is mapped to (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0 + kÎ¸). Wait, but Î¸ is the parameter here. If we fix z=0, then Î¸ goes from 0 to 2Ï, so the image is (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, kÎ¸) for Î¸ in [0,2Ï], which is a helix in the plane z=0? Wait, no, in 3D space, (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, kÎ¸) is a helix, but if k=0, it's a circle. If kâ 0, it's a helix. But in our case, when z=0, the image is a helix, which is not a circle. Therefore, the base at z=0 would be a helix, not a planar circle. Therefore, in this case, the bending would map the original base circle (at z=0) to a helix, which is not planar. Therefore, the bases do not have to remain planar.

But wait, in this case, the helicoid parametrization is (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + kÎ¸). But Î¸ here is the angle parameter, and z is the height. So, when z=0, Î¸ goes from 0 to 2Ï, giving a helix in the z=0 plane? Wait, no, the z-coordinate is 0 + kÎ¸, so the helix is in the plane z=0? Wait, no, z=0 + kÎ¸, so for Î¸ from 0 to 2Ï, the z-coordinate goes from 0 to 2Ïk. So, actually, that's a helix that starts at (1,0,0) and ends at (cos2Ï, sin2Ï, 2Ïk) = (1,0,2Ïk). So, it's a helix that's not confined to the plane z=0. Therefore, the base at z=0 is mapped to a helix that's not in a plane, hence non-planar.

Therefore, this suggests that the answer is no, the bases do not have to remain planar. But I need to confirm if this is an isometric bending.

Wait, the problem states that the bending must be an isometry between M and M_t. So, the metric on M must be preserved. The original cylinder has a metric where moving along Î¸ or z is Euclidean. If we twist it into a helicoid, does that preserve the metric? Let's check.

In the standard cylinder parametrization, the metric is:

dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ².

If we perform a helical twist, such that the coordinates are transformed as Î¸' = Î¸ + kz, z' = z. Then, the new coordinates are related by Î¸' = Î¸ + kz, z' = z. The inverse transformation would be Î¸ = Î¸' - kz', z = z'.

The Jacobian matrix for this transformation is:

dÎ¸/dÎ¸' = 1, dÎ¸/dz' = -k,

dz/dÎ¸' = 0, dz/dz' = 1.

Therefore, the metric in the new coordinates is:

dsÂ² = (dÎ¸')Â² + (dz')Â² + 2k dÎ¸' dz' - 2k dÎ¸' dz' = (dÎ¸')Â² + (dz')Â².

Wait, but this is the same as the original metric. Therefore, the transformation is an isometry. Therefore, this twisting is indeed an isometric bending. Therefore, the original cylinder is isometrically bent into a helicoid (which is a helicoid with k â  0), and the boundaries, which were circles, are now helices, hence non-planar. Therefore, the bases do not have to remain planar.

But wait, in this case, the helicoid is a developable surface, so it's an isometric image of the cylinder. Therefore, according to this, the answer would be no, the bases can be non-planar.

But then, the problem says ""must any bending of M leave the bases planar?"" So, since we can bend it into a helicoid where the bases are helices (non-planar), the answer is no. Therefore, the bases do not have to remain planar.

But I need to check if this is correct. Let's make sure that the helicoid is indeed a smooth submanifold with boundary. The helicoid is a smooth surface, and if we take the subset where z' ranges from 0 to 1, then the boundary would be the two helices at z'=0 and z'=1. However, these helices are not planar, so the bases are not planar. Therefore, this bending would satisfy the conditions: it's smooth, the image is a submanifold with boundary, it's an isometry, and it starts at the original cylinder. Therefore, such a bending exists where the bases are not planar.

Therefore, the answer is no, the bases do not have to remain planar.

But wait, the problem states that M_t is a submanifold with boundary of âÂ³. The helicoid is a smooth submanifold, but the boundaries are helices, which are not planar. So, this seems to fit the problem's conditions. Therefore, the answer should be no.

But I recall that in some contexts, when you talk about cylinders, you might require that they are right cylinders, meaning their axis is straight. However, in differential geometry, a cylinder can be any surface that is a product of a curve and a line. But in this problem, the original cylinder is a right circular cylinder. However, the bending can produce a helicoid, which is a different kind of cylinder (a helicoidal cylinder), but still a developable surface. Therefore, the bases can be non-planar.

But wait, in the helicoid example I considered, the boundaries are helices, which are curves, not necessarily closed. Wait, in the problem statement, M is defined as Î¸ in [0,2Ï], so the original cylinder has closed boundaries at z=0 and z=1. If we bend it into a helicoid, the boundaries should also be closed. But if we use the parametrization (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + kÎ¸), then when Î¸ goes from 0 to 2Ï, the z-coordinate goes from 0 to 2Ïk. Therefore, the boundary at z=0 is a helix from Î¸=0 to 2Ï, which is a closed curve, but not a circle. Similarly, the boundary at z=1 (if z is fixed) would not be closed unless k=0. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, let me clarify. The original manifold M is a cylinder with Î¸ â [0, 2Ï] and z â [0, 1]. So, it's a cylinder where Î¸ is an interval and z is an interval. When we apply the bending, we have to ensure that the boundaries at Î¸=0, Î¸=2Ï, z=0, z=1 are preserved as boundaries. However, in the helicoid parametrization (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + kÎ¸), the boundary at Î¸=0 would be the curve (1, 0, z + 0) = (1, 0, z) as z goes from 0 to 1. Similarly, the boundary at Î¸=2Ï would be (cos2Ï, sin2Ï, z + 2Ïk) = (1, 0, z + 2Ïk). Therefore, these are two vertical lines on the helicoid. But the original boundaries were circles. So, in this case, the bending maps the original vertical circle at Î¸=0 to a vertical line at (1,0,z), which is not a planar circle. Therefore, the boundaries are indeed non-planar.

Therefore, this example shows that it's possible to bend the cylinder such that the bases (the boundaries) are not planar. Therefore, the answer is no, the bases do not have to remain planar.

But I need to check if this bending is indeed an isometry. Let's compute the metric.

In the original cylinder, the metric is:

dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ².

In the helicoid parametrization (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + kÎ¸), we can compute the first fundamental form.

Letâs denote the parametrization as:

x(Î¸, z) = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + kÎ¸).

Then, the partial derivatives are:

x_Î¸ = (-sinÎ¸, cosÎ¸, k),

x_z = (0, 0, 1).

Therefore, the first fundamental form coefficients are:

E = x_Î¸ Â· x_Î¸ = sinÂ²Î¸ + cosÂ²Î¸ + kÂ² = 1 + kÂ²,

F = x_Î¸ Â· x_z = 0 + 0 + k*1 = k,

G = x_z Â· x_z = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1.

Therefore, the metric is:

dsÂ² = (1 + kÂ²)dÎ¸Â² + 2k dÎ¸ dz + dzÂ².

But in the original cylinder, the metric is dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². These are only equal if k=0. Therefore, this parametrization is not an isometry unless k=0. Therefore, my previous thought that this is an isometry is incorrect. Therefore, this bending is not an isometry. Therefore, my example is flawed.

Oh, that's a problem. So, the parametrization I considered does not preserve the metric unless k=0. Therefore, it's not an isometric bending. Therefore, I need to find another way to isometrically bend the cylinder.

Alternatively, maybe there's another parametrization where the metric is preserved. Let's think.

An isometric bending must preserve the metric. So, we need to find a mapping Î: M Ã [0,1] â âÂ³ such that for each t, the induced metric on M_t is the same as the original metric on M. The original metric is dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ².

Suppose we perform a helical twist, but adjust the parametrization to preserve the metric. For example, consider a rotation of the cylinder around the z-axis as we move along the z-axis. Letâs say for each z, we rotate the circle at height z by an angle proportional to z. So, the parametrization would be:

x(Î¸, z) = (cos(Î¸ + kz), sin(Î¸ + kz), z).

Then, compute the first fundamental form.

x_Î¸ = (-sin(Î¸ + kz), cos(Î¸ + kz), 0),

x_z = (-k sin(Î¸ + kz), k cos(Î¸ + kz), 1).

Therefore, the metric coefficients are:

E = x_Î¸ Â· x_Î¸ = sinÂ²(Î¸ + kz) + cosÂ²(Î¸ + kz) = 1,

F = x_Î¸ Â· x_z = -k sin(Î¸ + kz) cos(Î¸ + kz) + k cos(Î¸ + kz) sin(Î¸ + kz) = 0,

G = x_z Â· x_z = kÂ² sinÂ²(Î¸ + kz) + kÂ² cosÂ²(Î¸ + kz) + 1 = kÂ² + 1.

Therefore, the metric is:

dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + (kÂ² + 1) dzÂ².

But the original metric is dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². Therefore, unless k=0, this is not preserved. Therefore, this parametrization is not an isometry unless k=0. So, this is not an isometric bending.

Therefore, my previous idea is incorrect. So, how can we isometrically bend the cylinder?

Wait, another approach: since the cylinder is a developable surface, it can be isometrically embedded into âÂ³ as a ruled surface. The only ruled surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature are cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. Since cones have a singularity, and tangent developables are ruled surfaces with a straight line as a generator but might not be smooth submanifolds with boundary, the only possible isometric bendings are cylinders. Therefore, the answer should be yes, the bases must remain planar.

But earlier, I thought about the helicoid, but that's not an isometric bending. So, perhaps the only isometric bendings are other cylinders, which have planar bases.

But wait, there's also the tangent developable, which is a ruled surface generated by a moving straight line. For example, the tangent developable of a curve is a ruled surface where each generator is tangent to the curve. If we take the cylinder and isometrically bend it into a tangent developable, then the bases might not be planar.

Wait, let's think. A tangent developable of a straight line is just a plane. But if the original curve is a helix, then the tangent developable would be a helicoid. But the helicoid has zero Gaussian curvature, but it's not a cylinder. However, as we saw earlier, the helicoid's parametrization does not preserve the metric unless it's a plane. Therefore, perhaps the only isometric bendings are other cylinders.

Alternatively, maybe we can take the cylinder and perform a ""twisting"" without stretching, but how?

Wait, another idea: if we perform a translation along the z-axis while rotating the cylinder. For example, imagine rolling the cylinder along a line in space. As you roll it, the surface remains developable, and the metric is preserved. However, the boundaries would become helices, but the problem is whether this is an isometric bending.

Wait, but rolling the cylinder on a plane would create a helical movement, but in this case, the cylinder is being rolled on another surface. However, in our case, we are mapping M to another submanifold in âÂ³. If we roll the cylinder on a plane, the resulting surface is a helicoid, but the boundaries would be circles if we roll it without slipping. Wait, if you unroll the cylinder, you get a rectangle. If you roll it on a plane, you get a helicoid, but the boundaries would be circles only if you roll it without slipping. Wait, no, when you roll a cylinder on a plane, the contact point traces a cycloid, but the surface itself is a helicoid. However, the boundaries of the cylinder (the circles at z=0 and z=1) would be mapped to helices on the helicoid.

But in this case, the rolling is an isometric bending, right? Because rolling without slipping preserves the metric. Therefore, the resulting surface is a helicoid, and the boundaries are helices, hence non-planar. Therefore, this would be an isometric bending where the bases are non-planar. Therefore, the answer should be no.

But wait, but when you roll a cylinder on a plane, you are actually performing a motion that is not just a bending within âÂ³, but also involves the plane. However, in the problem statement, the bending is a mapping from MÃ[0,1] to âÂ³, so perhaps rolling the cylinder on a plane is not directly applicable. Alternatively, maybe we can model the rolling as a bending in âÂ³.

Wait, consider the cylinder M and imagine bending it such that each point (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) is mapped to (cosÎ¸ cosÏ(z), sinÎ¸ cosÏ(z), sinÏ(z)), where Ï(z) is some function. But this would be a cone if Ï(z) is constant. But cones are not smooth submanifolds with boundary.

Alternatively, suppose we perform a bending where the cylinder is twisted such that each vertical line (for fixed Î¸) becomes a helical line. But as we saw earlier, this does not preserve the metric unless it's a plane.

Wait, maybe the key is that any isometric bending of the cylinder must preserve the metric, and the only way to do that is by moving the cylinder in space without stretching or compressing, which can be done by translation or rotation. However, translating the cylinder in the z-direction would just move it up or down, keeping the bases planar. Rotating the cylinder around the z-axis would rotate the bases but keep them planar. However, if we perform a helical motion, which combines rotation and translation, then the bases would no longer be planar.

But how can such a helical motion be represented as an isometric bending?

Wait, perhaps the problem is related to the fact that the cylinder is a product of SÂ¹ and [0,1]. An isometric bending must preserve the product structure, but if we twist it, the product structure is altered. However, the metric must still be preserved. Therefore, the only isometric bendings are those that are isometries of the cylinder, which are combinations of rotations and translations. Therefore, the bases remain planar.

But earlier, we saw that the helicoid parametrization does not preserve the metric unless k=0, which suggests that twisting the cylinder does not result in an isometric bending. Therefore, the only isometric bendings are those that preserve the planar bases.

But there's another way: if we take the cylinder and perform a global isometry that is not just a rotation or translation. For example, consider an isometry that maps each point (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) to (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + f(Î¸)). Wait, but this would require that the metric is preserved. Let's compute.

Suppose we define Î(m, t) = (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + t f(Î¸)). Then, the induced metric would be:

dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + (dz + t f'(Î¸) dÎ¸)Â² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ² + 2 t f'(Î¸) dÎ¸ dz + tÂ² (f'(Î¸))Â² dÎ¸Â².

To preserve the metric, we need 2 t f'(Î¸) = 0 and tÂ² (f'(Î¸))Â² = 0 for all Î¸ and t. The only solution is f'(Î¸) = 0, so f(Î¸) = constant. Therefore, the only such isometry is a vertical translation, which preserves the metric. Therefore, this does not allow any twisting.

Alternatively, consider a more general isometry. Since the cylinder is a Lie group, its isometry group includes rotations and translations. Any isometry must be a combination of these. Therefore, the only isometric bendings are those that rotate and/or translate the cylinder, which would keep the bases planar.

Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar.

But earlier, I thought about rolling the cylinder on a plane, which would create a helicoid, but that seems not to preserve the metric. However, if you roll the cylinder on a plane without slipping, the metric is preserved. Wait, but rolling the cylinder on a plane is a motion that involves both the cylinder and the plane, but in our problem, the bending is just a mapping within âÂ³. So, perhaps rolling the cylinder on a plane is not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, consider that an isometric bending must preserve the metric, so any bending that introduces curvature would violate the isometry. Since the cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature, the bent surface must also have zero Gaussian curvature. The only surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature that can be isometrically embedded in âÂ³ are planes, cylinders, and tangent developables. Planes are just flat, cylinders are the original and other cylinders, and tangent developables are ruled surfaces with zero curvature.

However, tangent developables have a straight line as a generator, but they are not compact, and their boundaries would be non-circular. However, our original cylinder is compact (since it's a product of SÂ¹ and [0,1]). Therefore, any isometric bending must also be compact. The only compact developable surfaces with two circular boundaries are cylinders. Therefore, the bases must remain planar.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the bases must remain planar.

But earlier, I thought about the helicoid, but that's not compact. A helicoid is not compact because it extends to infinity. However, in our problem, the bending is over MÃ[0,1], and each M_t is a submanifold with boundary. So, the helicoid over [0,1] in z would be compact, but its boundaries would be helices, not circles. However, the problem states that the bending must be an isometry between M and M_t. So, if M_t is a helicoid over zâ[0,1], then the boundary at z=0 and z=1 are helices, which are not circles. Therefore, the problem does not require the boundaries to be circles, only that the map is an isometry and that M_t is a submanifold with boundary.

However, the key point is whether such a bending exists. If it does, then the answer is no. If it doesn't, then the answer is yes.

But to check whether such a bending exists, we need to see if there's an isometric embedding of the cylinder into a helicoid with compact boundaries. However, as we saw earlier, the standard parametrization of the helicoid does not preserve the metric unless it's a plane. Therefore, perhaps such a bending does not exist.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different parametrization. Let's consider a more general approach.

Suppose we have a developable surface with boundary. The cylinder is a developable surface with two circular boundaries. The problem is whether any isometric bending of the cylinder must have planar boundaries.

In differential geometry, a developable surface is a surface with zero Gaussian curvature. The cylinder is a developable surface, and so are cones (except at the apex) and tangent developables. However, cones are not smooth at the apex, and tangent developables are ruled surfaces with a straight line as a generator.

Given that the problem requires M_t to be a submanifold with boundary, which excludes cones (due to the singularity at the apex) and tangent developables (which may have singularities), the only possible isometric bendings are other cylinders. Therefore, the bases must remain planar.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar.

But earlier, I considered the helicoid and thought it might be possible, but it seems that the helicoid cannot be isometrically embedded as a compact surface with circular boundaries. Therefore, perhaps the only isometric bendings are cylinders, hence the bases must remain planar.

Therefore, the final answer is yes, the bases must remain planar.

1. **Isometry and Developable Surfaces**: An isometry preserves the intrinsic metric (Gaussian curvature). Since \\( M \\) has zero Gaussian curvature, \\( M_t \\) must also be a developable surface (zero Gaussian curvature). Developable surfaces include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables.

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether any bending of the manifold M must leave the bases planar. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, M is defined as the set of points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is from 0 to 2Ï and z is from 0 to 1. So, this is a cylinder, right? Like a cylinder standing on its side, with the base circle at z=0 and the top circle at z=1. The parameter Î¸ goes around the circular base, and z goes up the cylinder.

A bending of M is a smooth map Î that takes M Ã [0,1] to RÂ³, satisfying three conditions:

1. For each t, Î[M Ã {t}] is a submanifold with boundary in RÂ³. So, each M_t is a surface that's a smoothly bent version of the original cylinder.

2. Î(m, 0) = m, meaning at time t=0, nothing has changed; the initial shape is M.

3. For every t, the map from m to Î(m, t) is an isometry between M and M_t. So, each M_t is isometric to the original cylinder M. Isometry here means that distances on the surface are preserved, right? So, the bending doesn't stretch or shrink the surface, just bends it.

The question is: Must any such bending leave the bases planar? The bases are the circles at z=0 and z=1. So, even if you bend the cylinder into some other shape, do the two circular bases have to stay in their original planes, or can they become tilted or something?

Hmm. Let me think. If the bending is an isometry, then the intrinsic geometry is preserved. The original cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature because it's a developable surface. Any isometric deformation of a developable surface should preserve the zero Gaussian curvature. So, the bent surface M_t should also be a developable surface, right?

Developable surfaces are those that can be flattened without stretching. They include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. So, if we start with a cylinder (zero curvature), after an isometric bending, we can get another developable surface. But how does this affect the bases?

Wait, the original bases are circles. If we bend the cylinder into another developable surface, what happen to the circles? For example, if we bend it into a cone, the original circular bases would become circles, but their planes might tilt. But cones have a single developable surface, but they have a cone point where the Gaussian curvature is non-zero. Wait, no, cones are developable but they have a conical point where the curvature is concentrated. So, actually, cones are not isometric to cylinders because the curvature is different. Wait, but if we perform an isometric bending, then the Gaussian curvature should remain zero everywhere except maybe at points of singularity.

But in our case, the bending is supposed to be smooth, right? The problem says Î is a smooth map, so M_t is a submanifold with boundary, which suggests that there are no singularities in the surface. Therefore, M_t should be a smooth developable surface with zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. So, what are the possible developable surfaces with zero curvature?

Developable surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature are cylinders, cones, and planes. Wait, planes are also developable, but they have zero curvature. But in our case, the surface is a cylinder, so when we perform an isometric bending, can we get a cone?

Wait, but cones have a cone point where the curvature is concentrated, which is a singularity. Since the problem states that M_t is a submanifold with boundary, which is a smooth surface without singularities, so cones would not qualify because they have a cone point. Therefore, the only developable surfaces without singularities are cylinders and planes. But since our original surface is a cylinder, and isometric bending preserves the curvature, then any isometric bending of the cylinder must result in another cylinder or a plane?

Wait, but a plane would require the surface to be flat, but our original cylinder is not flat; it's a cylinder. Wait, the cylinder is a flat surface in the sense that it can be isometrically embedded into the plane. But if we bend it into a plane, that would require the surface to be flat, but the cylinder already is a flat surface. Wait, maybe I'm confusing things.

Wait, the Gaussian curvature of the cylinder is zero because it's a developable surface. So, any isometric bending of the cylinder must result in another developable surface with zero Gaussian curvature. The only such surfaces are cylinders and planes. But since the original surface is a cylinder, which is a closed surface with boundary, and we are bending it, the resulting M_t must also be a cylinder with boundary. Because if we were to flatten it into a plane, that would require the surface to be a plane, but a plane is not a cylinder. So, maybe the only possible isometric bendings of the cylinder are other cylinders.

But wait, a cylinder can be bent into a cone, but as I thought before, cones have a singularity. But the problem states that M_t is a submanifold with boundary, which implies it's smooth. Therefore, cones are excluded. Therefore, the only possible isometric bends of the cylinder are other cylinders. Therefore, the bases must remain circles, which are planar. Therefore, the answer is yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

But wait, is that necessarily true? Let me think again. Suppose we take the cylinder and perform an isometric bending that is not just another cylinder. For example, can we twist the cylinder along its axis? Wait, twisting would preserve the isometry? Wait, twisting a cylinder along its axis would actually be an isometry. For example, imagine taking a cylinder and twisting it like a screw. The distances on the surface are preserved, but the orientation of the surface is changed. However, the bases would still be circles, but their orientation in space would be different. However, the problem says that the bending must be such that each M_t is a submanifold with boundary. So, if you twist the cylinder, the bases are still circles, but their planes might be rotated. However, the question is whether the bases are planar. If we twist the cylinder, the bases remain circles lying in their own planes, but the planes might be tilted. However, in 3D space, the planes of the bases could be rotated, but they are still planar. Wait, but a plane is just a flat surface. If the bases are circles, their planes are flat. So, even if you rotate the bases in space, their planes remain flat. Therefore, the bases are still planar. So, even if you twist the cylinder, the bases are still in their own planes, which are flat. Therefore, the answer would still be yes.

But maybe there's another way to bend the cylinder such that the bases are not planar. Wait, but the problem states that each M_t is a submanifold with boundary. If the bases were not planar, that might imply that the boundary is not a smooth submanifold. Wait, the boundary of M is the two circles at z=0 and z=1. If we perform an isometric bending, the boundary of M_t should be the images of these circles. If the bending is smooth, then the boundaries should also be smooth curves, which are circles. But can a circle be embedded in 3D space in a non-planar way? For example, a circle can be embedded as a helix, but that's not a planar curve. Wait, but a circle is a set of points equidistant from a central point, but in 3D space, a helix is not a circle in the usual sense. Wait, no, a helix is a one-dimensional curve. A circle in 3D can be non-planar, like a latitude circle on a sphere, but that's still a circle. Wait, but a latitude circle on a sphere is a circle lying on a plane, but in the case of a cylinder, if you bend it, can the circles be non-planar?

Wait, but if the bending is an isometry, then the image of the original circles (which were planar) must be curves that are also circles, but their planes could be tilted. However, any circle in 3D space lies on a plane. So, even if the plane is tilted, the boundary circles are still planar. Therefore, the bases must remain planar. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But let me check if there's a different way. Suppose we take the cylinder and perform an isometric bending that is not just a translation or rotation. For example, can we bend it into a different shape where the bases are not planar? Wait, but in order for the surface to be isometric, the Gaussian curvature must remain zero. The only surfaces with zero Gaussian curvature are cylinders, cones, and planes. But cones have a singularity, which is excluded here. Planes would have to be flat, but the cylinder is not flat in the sense that it's a cylinder. Wait, but a cylinder is a flat surface because it can be isometrically embedded in the plane. However, if we isometrically bend the cylinder into another cylinder, which is also flat. So, maybe the only isometric bends of the cylinder are other cylinders. Therefore, the bases must remain planar.

Alternatively, maybe we can have a cylinder that is not right circular. For example, an oblique cylinder. But in that case, the bases are still parallel planes, but they are not perpendicular to the axis. However, the problem defines M as a right circular cylinder (since Î¸ goes from 0 to 2Ï, which is a circle). If we bend it into an oblique cylinder, then the bases would still be circles lying in parallel planes, but their orientation relative to the axis would be different. However, the problem states that the bending is smooth, and the bases are part of the boundary. If the bases are still circles lying in planes, then they are planar. So, even if the cylinder is oblique, the bases are still planar. Therefore, regardless of how you bend the cylinder isometrically, the bases must remain planar.

Wait, but is an oblique cylinder considered a developable surface? Yes, because it's a cylinder, just with the axis not perpendicular to the bases. But in our case, the original cylinder is a right circular cylinder, but if we perform an isometric bending, can we get an oblique cylinder? Let me think. An oblique cylinder would require that the sides are slant, but since the surface is isometric, the distances along the cylinder must be preserved. If we slant the cylinder, the vertical distance between the bases would be preserved, but the horizontal distance might change. Wait, no, because the cylinder's ""height"" (the distance along the axis) is preserved, but the slant would affect the horizontal component. Wait, but in the original cylinder, the length along the Î¸ direction is preserved (since it's a circle), and the length along the z direction is preserved (since it's a vertical cylinder). If we slant it, the distance along the axis would be preserved, but the horizontal component would depend on the slant. Wait, maybe not. Let me think of a specific example.

Suppose we take the cylinder and perform a translation along the z-axis while twisting it. Wait, that's a helical motion, which is an isometry. The distance along the cylinder's surface is preserved, but the boundary circles are still circles lying in planes, just rotated. However, the planes of the circles are still flat. So, the bases are planar.

Alternatively, if we shear the cylinder, like bending it into a slant, would that preserve the isometry? For example, imagine taking the cylinder and pushing the top circle horizontally so that the cylinder becomes slanted. But in 3D, how would that work? If we shear it, the distance along the axis might not be preserved. Wait, isometry requires that all distances on the surface are preserved. If we shear the cylinder, the vertical distance between the bases is preserved, but the horizontal distance might not be. Wait, but in the original cylinder, the vertical direction (z-axis) is perpendicular to the circular base. If we shear it, the axis is no longer perpendicular, but the distances along the circular direction (Î¸) and the vertical direction (z) are preserved. Wait, but if we shear it, the vertical direction would get a horizontal component, so the total distance moved along the axis would be preserved, but the horizontal component would change. However, in the surface, the metric is preserved. Let me formalize this.

The original cylinder has a metric where the distance element is dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². If we perform a shearing motion, we can imagine parametrizing the new surface with coordinates (Î¸, z), but mapping to a different point in space. For example, suppose we have a surface where the coordinates (Î¸, z) are mapped to (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸ + a z, z), where a is a constant. Then, the distance element would be dÎ¸Â² + (dz)^2 + (a dz)^2 = dÎ¸Â² + (1 + aÂ²) dzÂ². But this would not be isometric to the original cylinder, because the coefficients of dzÂ² are different. So, shearing in this way would not preserve the metric.

Alternatively, maybe a different parametrization. Suppose we take the cylinder and twist it. The twist would be an isometry because it only rotates the points around the axis. For example, Î(Î¸, z, t) = (cos(Î¸ + f(t) z), sin(Î¸ + f(t) z), z). Here, f(t) is a function that determines the twist amount at each height z and time t. The distance element still remains dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ², so this is an isometry. The bases are still circles, but their orientation in space is different. However, the planes of the bases are still flat. So, the bases are still planar, just rotated.

Therefore, in all these cases, the bases remain planar. Therefore, it seems that any isometric bending of the cylinder must keep the bases planar. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But let me think again. Suppose we have a more complex bending. For example, can we bend the cylinder into a helicoidal surface? Wait, a helicoid is a minimal surface, but it's not a cylinder. Wait, no, a helicoid is a different surface. The helicoid is a ruled surface with zero Gaussian curvature, but it's not a cylinder. However, a helicoid can be considered as a developable surface. But can we isometrically bend the cylinder into a helicoid?

Wait, the helicoid is a developable surface, so it can be isometrically embedded into the cylinder. But the cylinder and the helicoid are both developable, but they have different global structures. The cylinder is a cylinder, while the helicoid is a helical surface. However, the problem states that the bending is a map from M Ã [0,1] to RÂ³, so the entire surface is moved through space. If we could isometrically bend the cylinder into a helicoid, then the bases would be images of the original circles. But on a helicoid, the boundaries would not be circles. Wait, a helicoid is a surface that extends to infinity, but in our case, the cylinder is compact (z â [0,1]). So, maybe we can't have a helicoid as the image.

Alternatively, perhaps the only possible isometric bends of the cylinder are other cylinders or planes. But planes would have to be flat, but the cylinder is not a plane. Wait, but a plane can be a developable surface. If we could isometrically bend the cylinder into a plane, then the bases would become lines. But the original bases are circles, so their images would be circles on the plane, which are planar. Wait, but a plane can have circles, but they are still planar. However, the problem states that M_t is a submanifold with boundary, so a plane would have to be a flat surface with boundary. But the original cylinder has two boundary circles. If we isometrically bend it into a plane, the boundaries would be two circles on the plane, which are still planar. But is this possible?

Wait, the cylinder can be isometrically embedded into the plane as a flat surface. But the cylinder is not a subset of the plane. Wait, no, a cylinder is not a subset of the plane. To isometrically bend the cylinder into a plane, we would have to map it into the plane in a way that preserves distances. However, the cylinder has a non-zero circumference, so mapping it into the plane would require the image to be a flat surface with the same metric. But the plane is flat, but a cylinder can be mapped into the plane by ""unrolling"" it, but that's a diffeomorphism. However, in our case, we are considering an isometric map from the cylinder to another surface embedded in RÂ³. So, if we could isometrically embed the cylinder into a plane, but the plane is just a flat surface in RÂ³. However, the problem states that M_t is a submanifold of RÂ³, so it has to be a surface in 3D space. If we map the cylinder into a plane, which is a 2D surface in 3D space, then yes, it's possible. But in that case, the image would be a flat surface (like a rectangle or a strip), but the original cylinder has two circular boundaries. If we map the cylinder into a plane, the boundaries would be two circles on the plane, which are still planar. However, this would require that the entire cylinder is mapped into the plane, which is possible via an isometry. But in this case, the surface is flat, so the bases are still planar.

But wait, the problem states that the bending is a map from M Ã [0,1] to RÂ³, so each M_t is a surface in RÂ³. If we isometrically bend the cylinder into a plane, then M_t would be a flat surface in RÂ³, like a rectangular strip, with the boundaries being two circles. However, in RÂ³, a flat surface (a developable surface) can be a plane, but the plane is a non-compact surface. However, our original cylinder is compact (z â [0,1]), so the image in the plane would be a compact flat surface, which would have to be a rectangle or a strip. But the boundaries are circles, which are compact. This seems contradictory because a circle in the plane is a closed curve, but a rectangle in the plane is not a circle. Wait, perhaps this is not possible. If we isometrically bend the cylinder into a plane, the image would have to preserve the metric. The cylinder has a circular boundary with circumference 2Ï, so the image in the plane would have to have two circles with circumference 2Ï. But in the plane, two circles with the same circumference can be placed anywhere, but the surface between them would have to be flat. However, the problem is whether such a map exists. I think it does. For example, you can take the cylinder and map it to a flat strip in the plane with the same metric, but the boundaries are circles. Wait, but in the plane, a strip with circular boundaries would require that the strip is a cylinder, but in the plane, it's just a flat rectangle. Wait, no, if you have a flat surface in the plane with circular boundaries, that's not possible because a flat surface in the plane is either a plane or has zero curvature, but with circular boundaries, it's a portion of the plane. But the cylinder cannot be isometrically embedded into a flat surface in the plane unless it's just a flat strip, but then the boundaries would be lines or circles. Wait, perhaps if we map the cylinder to a flat strip in the plane, but the boundaries would be circles. However, in the plane, a flat strip with circular boundaries would require the strip to be like a cylinder, but in the plane, it's just a flat rectangle. This is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the only way to isometrically bend the cylinder is another cylinder. Because if you try to map it to a plane, the boundaries would have to be circles on the plane, but the surface in between would have to be flat. However, in the plane, the only way to have a flat surface with two circular boundaries is if it's a cylinder, but in the plane, it's just a flat rectangle. Therefore, perhaps such a mapping is not possible. Therefore, the only isometric bends of the cylinder are other cylinders.

Therefore, the bases must remain circles, which are planar. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But let me check another angle. Suppose we have a cylinder and perform an isometric bending that is not a simple cylinder. For example, can we have a cylinder that is not a right circular cylinder? For example, an oblique cylinder, as I thought before. But in that case, the bases are still circles lying in parallel planes. However, if we perform a more complex bending, could the bases become non-planar?

Wait, the problem states that each M_t is a submanifold with boundary. If the bases were non-planar, then the boundary would not be a smooth submanifold. Wait, the boundary of a submanifold with boundary in RÂ³ is a smooth submanifold of dimension one less. So, the boundary circles must be smooth curves. If the bases were non-planar, but still smooth, then they could be curves lying on a non-planar surface. However, the problem states that the map is an isometry between M and M_t, which means that the metric on M is preserved. The original metric on M is such that the bases are circles with circumference 2Ï. Therefore, the images of the bases under the isometry must also have the same circumference. However, if the bases are embedded non-planarly, their lengths would still be 2Ï, but they would be curves in 3D space. However, a curve in 3D space can have a circumference (length) of 2Ï but not be a planar circle. For example, a helical curve could have a length of 2Ï, but it's not a circle. However, the problem states that the map is an isometry, which should preserve not just the metric but also the entire structure.

Wait, but the isometry is between the surfaces, not necessarily preserving the embedding. The bases are circles on the original cylinder, and their images are curves on M_t. The fact that the map is an isometry means that distances on the surface are preserved, but the embedding into RÂ³ can be different. However, the image curves (the bases) must have the same length as the original circles. But even if they are non-planar, their length is preserved. However, the problem is asking whether the bases must be planar. So, even if the bases are non-planar curves in 3D space with length 2Ï, but they are not circles. However, the question is whether they must be planar. So, can an isometric bending result in non-planar bases?

Wait, but the original bases are circles. If we perform an isometric bending, the images of the bases must be curves that are isometric to circles. Isometric to circles in what sense? The metric on the boundary is preserved. So, if the original boundary circle has a metric induced from the cylinder, which is just the standard circle metric. Therefore, the image of the boundary under the isometry must also be a circle with the same metric. In 3D space, a circle is a set of points equidistant from a central point, lying on a plane. Therefore, if the image of the boundary is a circle, it must lie on a plane. Therefore, the bases must remain planar.

Therefore, even if the cylinder is bent into another shape, the boundaries must still be circles lying on planes. Therefore, the answer is yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

Therefore, after considering all these possibilities and checking, I think the answer is yes. The bases must remain planar under any isometric bending.

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether any bending of the manifold M must leave the bases planar. Let me start by understanding what M is. M is given by all points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is between 0 and 2Ï, and z is between 0 and 1. So, in simpler terms, this is a cylinder standing on the xy-plane, with its axis along the z-axis, and the height from z=0 to z=1. The bases are the circles at z=0 and z=1.

A bending of M is a smooth map Î from MÃ[0,1] to RÂ³, satisfying three conditions:

1. For each t, Î[MÃ{t}] is a submanifold with boundary of RÂ³ (call it M_t).
2. Î(m,0) = m, so at time t=0, the manifold is itself.
3. For each t, the map m â¦ Î(m,t) is an isometry between M and M_t.

So, essentially, we're deforming the cylinder M into another surface M_t in RÂ³ over time, such that each M_t is a submanifold (so it's smooth, no self-intersections, etc.), and the deformation is an isometry at each step. That means distances on M and M_t are preserved; the intrinsic geometry doesn't change. But the extrinsic geometry (how it sits in RÂ³) can change.

The question is whether any such bending must leave the bases (the circles at the top and bottom) planar. So, can the bases become non-planar during the bending?

Let me recall that an isometry preserves the first and second fundamental forms. Since we're dealing with surfaces in RÂ³, the first fundamental form is the induced metric, and the second fundamental form relates to the extrinsic curvature. But since the bending is an isometry, the first fundamental form is preserved, but the second fundamental form can change. Wait, no, actually, isometry of submanifolds in RÂ³ typically refers to preserving the first fundamental form, but the second fundamental form can vary. However, in RÂ³, if two surfaces are isometric, they can be different extrinsically even if they have the same metric. But in this case, since we are bending within RÂ³, we have to see how the extrinsic geometry can change while preserving the intrinsic.

But the question is about the bases. The bases are circles, which are curves. In the original position, these circles are in the planes z=0 and z=1, which are horizontal. After bending, the bases could potentially be deformed into different curves. But can they become non-planar? For example, could one base be a circle in a slant plane, or maybe a more complex curve?

Wait, but the bases are parts of the cylinder. The cylinder's bases are the sets where z=0 and z=1. If we isometrically bend the cylinder, the bases will be transformed into curves in space, but must these curves lie in planes?

First, let's recall that the cylinder M is a developable surface; it has zero Gaussian curvature. Developable surfaces are those that can be isometrically mapped to a plane, which is the case here because the cylinder can be ""unfolded"" into a rectangle. Since bending is an isometry, each M_t must also be a developable surface because the intrinsic geometry is preserved. Developable surfaces include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables (surfaces generated by straight lines tangent to a curve).

So, if we start with a cylinder and perform an isometric bending, the resulting surface must be developable. Therefore, the two boundaries of M_t must be curves that are parts of developable surfaces. However, the boundaries themselves (the bases) can be any curve as long as they lie on a developable surface. But in our case, the entire surface M_t is being considered. For a developable surface, the two boundaries (the top and bottom circles) must lie on a developable surface. However, a developable surface is either a cylinder, a cone, or a tangent developable.

Wait, but in our case, the original is a cylinder (a right circular cylinder), but after bending, can it become a cone? For example, if we bend the cylinder into a cone, then the bases would become circles, but the cone's base is a circle in a plane, but the other ""base"" (the vertex) is a point. Wait, no, a cone's base is a circle, and the other boundary is the vertex. But in our case, the cylinder has two circular bases. If we bend the cylinder into a cone, we would have to have one base as a circle and the other as a point, which is not a circle. But in our problem, the bending must leave the entire surface as a submanifold with boundary, so the boundaries must be curves. Therefore, perhaps the bending can't turn it into a cone because one of the boundaries would become a point, which is not a curve. Therefore, perhaps the only possible developable surfaces we can get are cylinders or tangent developables.

A tangent developable is a surface generated by the tangent lines to a curve. For example, imagine a curve in space, and then taking all tangent lines to that curve. This forms a surface. The boundaries of a tangent developable can be smooth curves. However, in our case, the original cylinder has two circular boundaries. If we isometrically bend it into a tangent developable, the boundaries would have to be curves on the tangent developable. However, the tangent developable has only one boundary, the generating curve, unless it's a closed tangent developable, which would require the generating curve to be closed. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the cylinder can be bent into another cylinder with different radii or slant? Wait, but if we bend it into a slanted cylinder, would that be possible? For example, a cylinder that is tilted in space. However, a slanted cylinder can still be considered as a right circular cylinder in some coordinate system, but in the original RÂ³, it's not a right circular cylinder. However, isometrically bending a cylinder into a slanted cylinder would require that the metric is preserved. However, the distance along the axis of the cylinder would change if we slant it. Wait, but in the cylinder, the axis is a line of extrinsic curvature. If we slant the cylinder, the axis would become a helical curve or something else. But the problem is, can we do that while preserving the metric?

Wait, actually, if we take a cylinder and perform a rigid motion (rotation or translation), then obviously the metric is preserved, and the bases remain planar. But if we perform a non-trivial bending, like rolling the cylinder into a different cylinder with a different radius, but that might not be possible unless we stretch or compress, but since it's an isometry, we can't stretch or compress. So, for example, if we have a cylinder of radius r and height h, and we want to bend it into another cylinder of radius r' and height h', but in order to preserve the metric, the circumference must remain the same. Since the circumference is 2Ïr, if we change the radius to r', the circumference would be 2Ïr', so unless r' = r, we can't do that. Therefore, bending the cylinder into another cylinder with the same circumference but different radius is impossible because that would require deformation, not isometry. Therefore, the only way to bend it into another cylinder is to keep the same radius and height, just rotated or translated. But those are trivial, and the bases remain planar.

Alternatively, can we bend the cylinder into a cone? Let's think. A cone can be formed by bending a sector of a plane into a cone. But in our case, we start with a cylinder. To bend a cylinder into a cone, we would have to collapse one of the circles (the top base) into a point, but in the problem statement, the bending must leave the entire surface as a submanifold with boundary, so the boundaries must be curves. Therefore, collapsing a circle into a point would violate the submanifold with boundary condition because the boundary would have a point, which is a 0-dimensional manifold, not a 1-dimensional manifold. Therefore, bending into a cone is not allowed here.

Another possibility is bending the cylinder into a tangent developable. For example, take a curve and generate a surface by moving along its tangent directions. If the original cylinder is bent into a tangent developable, then the boundaries would be curves on that tangent developable. But the tangent developable has only one boundary, the generating curve, unless it's a closed surface. Wait, a tangent developable can be closed if the generating curve is a closed curve. For example, a helicoid is not closed, but a tangent developable can be closed if the generating curve is a closed curve like a circle. Wait, actually, a tangent developable can be a cylinder if the generating curve is a line, but if the generating curve is a helix, then it's a helicoid. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall: a tangent developable is the surface swept by a line tangent to a curve. If the curve is a straight line, then the tangent developable is a plane. If the curve is a circle, then the tangent developable is a cone. Wait, no. If the generating curve is a circle in 3D space, then the tangent developable would be a surface generated by the tangent lines to that circle. If the circle is a latitude on a sphere, then the tangent lines would form a cone. Wait, maybe.

But in any case, if we start with a cylinder and isometrically bend it into a tangent developable, the boundaries would have to be curves on that tangent developable. However, the original cylinder has two circular boundaries. If we bend it into a tangent developable, how would the boundaries map? For example, if we take a cylinder and bend it into a tangent developable over a curve, the original circular boundaries would have to become parts of the tangent developable's boundary. But the tangent developable's boundary is the generating curve. So unless the generating curve is a closed curve, like a circle, and the tangent developable is a cone, then the boundaries would be the circles. But in that case, the original cylinder's two circles would have to map to the cone's base circle and... but a cone only has one circular boundary. Wait, maybe not. If you take a tangent developable over a curve that's a closed curve, like a circle, then the surface is a cone, and the boundary is the circle. But in our case, the original cylinder has two circles. So, perhaps you can't have a tangent developable that has two boundaries unless it's a cylinder again.

Alternatively, maybe there's another developable surface that can have two boundaries. For example, a cylinder has two circles as boundaries. A tangent developable over a closed curve has one boundary. A cone has one circular boundary. Therefore, the only developable surfaces with two boundary curves are cylinders and perhaps other developable surfaces like a right circular cylinder. Wait, maybe not. Wait, a right circular cylinder has two circular boundaries. If we take a cylinder and perform an isometric bending into another cylinder with the same radius but different axis, but that would just be a rigid motion, which doesn't change the extrinsic geometry. For example, rotating the cylinder around the origin would just move it in space but keep it a right circular cylinder. So, the bases remain planar.

But wait, could we have a cylinder where the two bases are not in parallel planes? For example, a slant cylinder where the two circular bases are in different planes but not parallel? Is that possible? Let me think. A slant cylinder would not be isometric to a right circular cylinder unless it's just a rigid motion. Because in a slant cylinder, the distance along the axis would change when you move along the axis, but in a right circular cylinder, the distance along the axis is constant. Wait, no. Wait, the intrinsic metric on a cylinder is such that the distance between two points depends on their angular and axial separation. If we slant the cylinder, the axial direction would be distorted. For example, imagine taking a right circular cylinder and then shearing it such that the top is shifted relative to the bottom. Then, the distance between points along the axis would no longer be the same as the original, because the axis is now slant. However, an isometry must preserve all distances, so if the axis is slant, the distances along the axis would have to remain the same. Therefore, a slant cylinder would not preserve the isometry. Therefore, you can't have a slant cylinder as an isometric bending of the original cylinder.

Therefore, perhaps the only possible isometric bendings of the cylinder are rigid motions that keep it a right circular cylinder, hence the bases remain planar. Alternatively, maybe there's a more complex bending where the cylinder becomes a different developable surface that still has two planar bases. Wait, but developable surfaces with two planar boundaries are only cylinders. Because if you have a developable surface with two planar boundaries, then the surface must be a cylinder. Because the only way to have two planar circles connected by a developable surface is a cylinder. If you tried to have a cone, the base is a circle, but the other boundary is a point. If you tried to connect two circles with a developable surface that is not a cylinder, you would need a surface that is not a cylinder, but I don't think such a surface exists with two planar boundaries. For example, a prism with two planar boundaries would be a cylinder. A cone has one planar boundary and one point. Therefore, the only developable surface with two planar circular boundaries is a cylinder.

Therefore, if we require that the bending is a developable surface (which it must be, since the bending is an isometry), and the boundaries are planar circles, then the only possibility is that the bent surface is another cylinder, hence the bases remain planar.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to have a developable surface with two non-planar boundaries. But in our case, the problem states that the bending must map the original cylinder into a submanifold with boundary, but it doesn't specify that the boundaries have to be planar. However, the question is asking whether the bending must leave the bases planar. So, even if it's possible to have a bending where the bases are non-planar, the answer would be no. But if all possible bendings must have planar bases, then the answer is yes.

So, perhaps there are bendings where the bases become non-planar. Let me think. Suppose we take the cylinder and perform a rotation along one of its axes. Wait, but rotation is a rigid motion, so the bases remain planar. Alternatively, suppose we perform a bending that's not a rigid motion. For example, take the cylinder and bend it into a helicoid. Wait, but a helicoid is not a developable surface, right? Wait, no, a helicoid is a minimal surface, but is it developable? The Gaussian curvature of a helicoid is zero, so it is a developable surface. Wait, actually, yes, a helicoid is a developable surface because it can be isometrically mapped to a plane. So, can we bend the cylinder into a helicoid? Let's see. The helicoid has a boundary that is a line, but we need to have two boundaries. Wait, the helicoid is a surface without boundary, or with a boundary? Actually, the helicoid can have a boundary if we restrict it. For example, if we take a helicoid from z=0 to z=1, then its boundary would be two helices. But in our case, the original cylinder has two circles as boundaries. So, to isometrically bend the cylinder into a helicoid segment with two helical boundaries, would that be possible? But the problem is, the helicoid's boundaries are not circles but helices, which are non-planar curves. However, the problem states that the bending must map M into a submanifold with boundary M_t, but it doesn't specify that the boundaries have to be circles. Wait, but in the original M, the boundaries are circles. If we perform an isometric bending, the boundaries must be mapped to curves that are isometric images of the original circles. But the original circles have circumference 2Ï, so their images must also have circumference 2Ï. However, a helix has a different circumference when projected onto a plane, but in 3D, the length of the helix is longer. Wait, but the intrinsic metric is preserved. The original circle has length 2Ï, so the image boundary must also have length 2Ï. However, a helical curve in 3D space with the same intrinsic metric as the circle would require that the extrinsic length is preserved. But a helical curve in 3D space with length 2Ï would have to have a certain pitch. However, the problem is, can we bend the cylinder into a surface with boundaries that are helices, which are not planar, but have the same intrinsic metric as the original circles?

Wait, but the boundaries are curves in the surface M_t. The intrinsic metric of the boundary curve (a geodesic circle on the cylinder) is such that its length is 2Ï. If we map this to another curve in M_t, the new curve must also have length 2Ï. However, the extrinsic geometry of the curve in RÂ³ can be different, but the intrinsic metric (the metric induced on the boundary curve) must be the same. For the cylinder, the boundary circle is a geodesic with constant curvature. If we map it to another curve, say a helix, the helix in RÂ³ would have a different extrinsic curvature, but the intrinsic metric (the length) must still be 2Ï. However, a helix with length 2Ï would have a certain pitch. But can such a helix be realized as a boundary of a developable surface?

Alternatively, maybe the cylinder can be bent into a tangent developable, which is a cone. Wait, but a cone has only one boundary, the base. So, unless we have a truncated cone, but then the other boundary would be a circle inside the cone. However, in our case, the original cylinder has two circles. So, perhaps we can't map them to a cone's boundaries. Therefore, maybe the only possible way to have two boundaries is to have a cylinder again.

Wait, another thought: if we take the cylinder and roll it up into a cone, but since the cylinder has two circles, rolling it into a cone would require that one circle becomes the base of the cone and the other circle becomes a slant circle on the cone. However, the cone's slant circle is not a geodesic, and the problem is, when you roll a cylinder into a cone, you're essentially cutting out a sector and gluing the edges, which changes the metric. Wait, no, that's not an isometry. Rolling a cylinder into a cone would involve stretching or compressing, which isn't allowed in an isometry. Therefore, that's not an isometric bending.

Alternatively, maybe we can perform a bending that's more complex. For example, take the cylinder and perform a bending that is a combination of rotation and translation. But such a motion would still keep the bases planar. Alternatively, if we can perform a bending that deforms the cylinder into a different developable surface without changing the metric, perhaps the bases can become non-planar.

Wait, let's think about the developable surfaces. A developable surface can be isometrically mapped to a plane. For the cylinder, the developable surface is a plane when you ""unroll"" it. If we bend the cylinder into another developable surface, like another cylinder, or a cone, or a tangent developable, the boundaries must correspond to the boundaries of the developed plane.

Wait, when you unroll a cylinder, you get a rectangle in the plane. The boundaries of the cylinder correspond to the left and right edges of the rectangle. If you bend the cylinder into another developable surface, say a cone, then the developed surface would be a sector of a plane. The boundaries of the cone (the base circle) correspond to the boundary of the sector. However, in our case, the original cylinder has two boundaries, so when unrolled, they correspond to two straight lines in the developed plane. If we then develop this into a cone, the two straight lines would become two radii of the sector, but a cone only has one boundary. Therefore, this suggests that we can't have two boundaries when developing into a cone.

Alternatively, if we develop into another cylinder, the two boundaries would correspond to two vertical lines in the developed plane, which when rolled back up, become two circles on the cylinder. Therefore, the only way to have two boundaries is to have a cylinder again. Therefore, this suggests that the only isometric bendings of the cylinder are other cylinders, hence the bases remain planar.

But wait, is there a way to have a developable surface with two non-planar boundaries? For example, a helicoid has a boundary that's a line, but if we restrict it, maybe not. Or, perhaps a hyperbolic paraboloid? But a hyperbolic paraboloid is not developable. Wait, no, hyperbolic paraboloids have negative Gaussian curvature, so they aren't developable. Developable surfaces have zero Gaussian curvature.

Another example is a cylinder (zero curvature), cone (zero curvature), and tangent developables (zero curvature). So, if we can only have these, and the cylinder requires two boundaries, then the only possible developable surfaces with two boundaries are cylinders. Therefore, any isometric bending of the cylinder must result in another cylinder, hence the bases remain planar.

But is this always the case? Let me check some references or known theorems. For example, in differential geometry, a theorem by Fenchel says that the total curvature of a simple closed curve in space is at least 2Ï, and equality holds if and only if the curve is a planar circle. Wait, but I'm not sure if this applies here. Alternatively, the Cohn-Vossen theorem states that a closed convex curve in space with total curvature 2Ï is planar. But our boundaries are circles, which have total curvature 2Ï, but they are not necessarily convex. Wait, maybe not directly applicable.

Alternatively, think about the curve's Frenet-Serret frame. The original circle has zero torsion and constant curvature. If we deform it isometrically, preserving its intrinsic metric (i.e., arc length), but changing its extrinsic curvature and torsion. However, the bending must preserve the entire surface's metric. If the surface is developable, then the Gaussian curvature is zero, and the surface can be isometrically embedded in RÂ³. But how does this affect the boundary curves?

Alternatively, consider that the boundaries are geodesic circles on the cylinder. When you isometrically bend the cylinder into another surface, the geodesic circles must map to geodesic curves on the new surface. On a cylinder, the geodesics are helices, circles, and straight lines along the axis. If the new surface is a cone, the geodesics on a cone are circles, lines, and hyperbolas. But the boundaries are circles on the original cylinder, so they must map to circles on the new surface. If the new surface is a cone, then a circle on the cone would have to be a latitude, but the cone's circle would have a different circumference unless it's scaled. However, since the bending is an isometry, the circumference must remain 2Ï. But on a cone, the circumference of a latitude is smaller than the circumference of the base. Therefore, unless the radius of the circle on the cone is such that its circumference is 2Ï, but the cone's radius is scaled accordingly. However, scaling would require stretching or compressing, which is not allowed in an isometry. Therefore, this is impossible. Therefore, the only way to preserve the circumference is to have the same radius, hence the same cone base, but then the other boundary would collapse. Therefore, this suggests that you can't have a cone as the bent surface.

Therefore, the only possible developable surfaces with two boundaries of circumference 2Ï are cylinders. Therefore, any isometric bending of the cylinder must result in another cylinder, hence the bases remain planar.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, any bending must leave the bases planar.

","Okay, let's try to tackle this problem about bending the cylinder M and whether the bases must stay planar. Hmm, so M is a cylinder defined by all points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is between 0 and 2Ï, and z is between 0 and 1. So it's like a right circular cylinder with height 1. A bending is a smooth map Î that takes M Ã [0,1] to âÂ³, such that each M_t = Î(M Ã {t}) is a submanifold with boundary, starts as M when t=0, and for each t, the map from M to M_t is an isometry. So, essentially, we're deforming the cylinder smoothly through time, keeping it isometric at each step. The question is whether any such bending must leave the bases (the top and bottom circles when z=0 and z=1) planar.

First, I need to recall what an isometry means here. An isometry is a transformation that preserves distances between points. Since the cylinder M has a certain intrinsic geometry, any bending that's an isometry can't stretch or shrink any part of it; it can only bend or twist it in a way that doesn't change the lengths of curves on the surface.

The bases of the cylinder are the circles at z=0 and z=1. Originally, they are planar, lying in the planes z=0 and z=1. The question is whether during any bending process, these bases must remain planar. So, could we twist or bend the cylinder in such a way that the top and bottom circles become non-planar, but still keeping the entire cylinder isometric?

I remember that the cylinder is a developable surface, meaning it can be isometrically mapped to a plane. This is because its Gaussian curvature is zero. The fact that it's developable is a key point here. Now, when you have a developable surface, any isometric bending (or developable bending) should preserve the flatness of the surface. However, the problem is about the bending of the entire cylinder, not just the surface. Wait, but the problem states that for each t, the map from M to M_t is an isometry. So, the bending must preserve the intrinsic metric of M. Since M has zero curvature, each M_t must also have zero curvature. Therefore, each M_t must be a developable surface.

Developable surfaces include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. So, if the cylinder is bent into another developable surface, could that surface have non-planar bases? Let's think. For example, a cone is a developable surface, but its base is a circle in a plane, right? Wait, a cone is generated by straight lines (generators) from a point (the apex) to a circle. The base of the cone is a circle in a plane, but if you take a cylinder and bend it into a cone, the original top and bottom circles would become circles on the cone's surface. But on the cone, the base is still a circle in a plane. Wait, maybe not. Let me visualize. If you have a cylinder and you bend it into a cone, the top and bottom would wrap around the cone. But in that case, the original top and bottom circles would become circles on the cone's surface, but the base (which was z=1) would be part of the cone's surface. However, the base of the cone is a circle in a plane, but if you consider the original top of the cylinder, which was a circle at z=1, after bending into a cone, that circle would lie on the cone's surface. However, the cone's surface is not planar except at the base. Wait, perhaps in this case, the original top circle becomes a circle on the cone's surface, but the original bottom circle (z=0) would be another circle on the cone. But in a cone, the circles are not planar except the base. Wait, actually, the cone's surface is a ruled surface, but the circles on it (except the base) are not planar. So, if you bend the cylinder into a cone, the original top and bottom circles become circles on the cone's surface, which are not planar. Therefore, in this case, the bases would not be planar. But wait, the problem says that the bending must take M to M_t, which is a submanifold with boundary. So, if we bend the cylinder into a cone, the resulting M_t would have the base (the original z=0 or z=1) now lying on the cone's surface, which is not planar. Therefore, this suggests that the answer might be no, that the bases do not have to stay planar.

But wait, hold on. Let me check this again. If we take the cylinder and bend it into a cone, is that possible via an isometric bending? Because the cone has different geometry. For instance, the cone has a non-zero Gaussian curvature except at the apex. Wait, no, a cone is a developable surface, so its Gaussian curvature is zero everywhere except at the apex, where it has a singularity. However, in our case, the original cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature everywhere. If we bend the cylinder into a cone, then the cone's surface (without the apex) would have zero Gaussian curvature, which matches the cylinder. However, the problem states that M_t must be a submanifold with boundary. If we bend into a cone, the apex would be a singularity, which is not a smooth submanifold. Therefore, such a bending would not satisfy condition 1, because M_t would not be a smooth submanifold (it would have a cone point, which is a singularity). Therefore, maybe such a bending is not allowed? Therefore, the only possible developable surfaces without singularities are cylinders and tangent developables? Wait, tangent developables are like a ruled surface generated by lines tangent to a curve. Hmm, not sure.

Wait, perhaps the only smooth developable surfaces without singularities are cylinders and cones? But cones have a singularity at the apex. So, if we need M_t to be a smooth submanifold with boundary, then maybe the only possible developable surfaces are cylinders (right circular cylinders) or other cylinders that might be slant or something? Wait, no, any developable surface can be represented as a ruled surface generated by lines (the generators) that are parallel along a straight line. But for a cylinder, the generators are the straight lines parallel to the axis. For a cone, the generators meet at the apex. So, perhaps if we take a cylinder and bend it into another cylinder, but with a different axis? But then, the original bases (at z=0 and z=1) would become circles on the new cylinder. However, if the new cylinder is not right circular, but maybe slant or something, would the bases still be planar?

Wait, a slant cylinder would have generators that are not perpendicular to the base. For example, imagine a cylinder where the circular bases are not aligned vertically. However, such a cylinder would not be a right circular cylinder, but it's still a developable surface. However, the bases would be circles in planes that are not parallel. Wait, but if you have a cylinder with slant bases, the two bases are still circles, but in different planes. However, in such a case, the distance between the bases is along the slant, but the problem states that the original bases are at z=0 and z=1, which are in parallel planes. If we bend the cylinder into a slant cylinder, the new bases would be circles in planes that are not parallel. But the problem is about whether the original bases (z=0 and z=1) must stay planar. Wait, actually, the problem says ""the bases planar"", but which bases? The original bases are at z=0 and z=1, but after bending, the new M_t would have its own bases, which are the images of the original z=0 and z=1 under Î. So, if we bend the cylinder into a slant cylinder, then the images of z=0 and z=1 under Î would be circles in planes that might not be parallel, hence non-planar in the sense that they are not in a single plane? Wait, no, a base of a cylinder is a circle in a plane. If the cylinder is slant, the two bases are still each in their own planes, but those planes are not necessarily parallel. However, each base is still a planar circle. Wait, but the problem says ""the bases planar"", so maybe the question is whether the original bases (z=0 and z=1) must remain in their original planes (i.e., in the z=0 and z=1 planes). But the problem states ""the bases planar"", not necessarily in the original planes. Wait, the problem says ""the bases planar"", so perhaps the question is whether, during any bending, the images of the original bases (the top and bottom circles) under Î must be planar. So, could they become non-planar?

Wait, if we have a bending, then for each t, M_t is a submanifold with boundary. The boundary of M_t would be the images of the original boundaries of M. The original boundary of M is the two circles at z=0 and z=1. So, the boundary of M_t is the union of the images of these two circles. If we can bend M into a non-planar surface such that the images of the original boundaries are not in a plane, then the bases would not be planar. But according to the problem, must they be planar?

But according to the properties of developable surfaces, which are what M_t must be since they are isometric to M (which is developable). So, each M_t is a developable surface. The only developable surfaces without singularities are cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. But cones have a singularity at the apex, so maybe in our case, since M_t must be a smooth submanifold with boundary, cones are excluded because they have a singular point. Similarly, tangent developables have a parabolic line where the generators become tangent, which might not be a smooth submanifold. So, perhaps the only possible developable surfaces without such singularities are right circular cylinders. But is that true?

Wait, a slant cylinder is also a developable surface. For example, a cylinder where the circular bases are not aligned vertically. However, such a cylinder is still a developable surface because you can roll it into a plane. However, the two bases of a slant cylinder are still circles in their respective planes, but those planes are not parallel. So, each base is planar, but they are in different planes. So, in this case, the images of the original bases (which were at z=0 and z=1) would be circles in non-parallel planes, hence not lying in a single plane, but each is a planar circle. Wait, but the problem says ""the bases planar"", which would mean that each base is a planar curve. In that case, even a slant cylinder would satisfy that each base is planar. However, the original problem is whether the bases must remain planar. If they are allowed to be in different planes, then they are still planar, but not co-planar. But maybe the problem is asking whether the bases must remain in their original planes. Wait, the problem says ""the bases planar"", not necessarily in the original planes. So, if the bases can be in different planes but still planar, then even in a slant cylinder, the bases are planar. However, in a slant cylinder, the two bases are circles in different planes. But each is a planar circle. Therefore, in that case, the bases are planar, just not in the same plane. So, maybe the answer is yes, they must remain planar, but not necessarily lying in the original planes. Wait, but the problem says ""must any bending of M leave the bases planar?"" So, even if you bend the cylinder into a slant cylinder, the bases are still planar. However, is that the only possibility? Or can you have a bending where the bases are not planar?

Wait, consider a different developable surface. For example, a tangent developable. A tangent developable is a surface formed by the tangent lines to a curve. It's a ruled surface where the generators are tangent to a curve. For example, the tangent developable to a curve is a surface where each generator is tangent to the curve at a point. If you take a curve in 3D space, the tangent developable is a developable surface. However, in such a surface, the generators are not all parallel, so it's not a cylinder. However, can we bend the original cylinder into such a surface while keeping the isometry?

But in a tangent developable, the surface is ruled by lines tangent to a curve. If we take a horizontal curve, say a horizontal line, then the tangent developable would be a plane. If the curve is more complicated, like a helix, then the tangent developable would be a helicoid. Wait, a helicoid is a minimal surface, but it is also a developable surface? Wait, no, a helicoid is a minimal surface but it's not developable. Wait, maybe I'm confused. Let me check.

A developable surface has zero Gaussian curvature. A helicoid does have zero Gaussian curvature, but it's not a ruled surface in the way that a cylinder or cone is. Wait, actually, a helicoid is a ruled surface, but it's not a developable surface? Wait, no, the helicoid is a minimal surface, and it is developable? Wait, I need to recall. A developable surface is one that can be isometrically mapped to a plane. The helicoid is a minimal surface, but it's not developable. Wait, maybe I'm wrong. Let me check. A cylinder and a cone are developable. A tangent developable is also developable. A helicoid is not developable. So, if we want to bend the cylinder into another developable surface, we can only do it into another cylinder, cone, or tangent developable. However, cones have a singularity, so maybe not allowed. Tangent developables might have a parabolic line where the surface is not smooth, but the problem states that M_t must be a submanifold with boundary, so perhaps tangent developables are allowed as long as the boundary is nice. But in that case, the images of the original bases (the circles at z=0 and z=1) would lie on the tangent developable. Are those circles planar?

Suppose we take a tangent developable to a curve. Let's say the curve is a circle in the plane z=0.5. Then the tangent developable would be a surface generated by lines tangent to this circle. Each generator is a line tangent to the circle. The resulting surface is a cylinder, but it's not a right circular cylinder. Wait, actually, the tangent developable to a circle is a cylinder, but not a right circular cylinder. Wait, no, if you take a circle and take all tangent lines, you get a cylinder. Wait, no, the tangent developable to a circle is a cylinder, but it's a circular cylinder. Wait, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, take a curve that's a helix. The tangent developable to a helix would be a surface where each generator is tangent to the helix. But such a surface is not a cylinder, and it's not planar. However, the images of the original bases (the circles at z=0 and z=1) would be curves on this surface. Are those curves planar? Probably not, because the surface is not a plane. So, in this case, the bases would not be planar. However, the problem requires that the map from M to M_t is an isometry. If we can isometrically bend the cylinder into such a tangent developable, then the bases would not be planar. But is this possible?

Wait, but the tangent developable to a curve is a developable surface, so it has zero Gaussian curvature. Therefore, an isometric bending from the cylinder to such a surface is possible. However, the problem is whether the map is an isometry between M and M_t. So, if we can isometrically map the cylinder to this tangent developable, then yes, such a bending exists, and the bases would not be planar. Therefore, this would imply that the answer is no, the bases do not have to stay planar.

But hold on, the original bases are circles in the plane z=0 and z=1. If we bend the cylinder into a tangent developable, the images of these circles would be curves on the tangent developable. Are those curves planar? Let's consider the tangent developable to a curve. Suppose the curve is a horizontal line in the plane z=0.5. Then the tangent developable would be the set of lines tangent to this line, which is just the plane itself. So, in this case, the bending would just be a plane, but the original cylinder cannot be isometrically mapped to a plane because the cylinder has a different topology (it's a cylinder, while the plane is not compact). Wait, but the problem allows M_t to be a submanifold with boundary, so maybe if we cut the cylinder open, but the original cylinder is a compact surface with boundary. Hmm, perhaps this is not possible.

Alternatively, take a curve that's a parabola in 3D space. The tangent developable to a parabola is a surface called a parabolic cylinder or something else? Wait, I need to recall. The tangent developable to a curve is a surface where each generator is tangent to the curve. For a general curve, this surface is developable, meaning it can be isometrically mapped to a plane. However, the image of the original cylinder's boundary (the two circles) under this mapping would be curves on the tangent developable. Are those curves planar?

Suppose the curve is a horizontal line. Then the tangent developable is the plane itself. But the original cylinder cannot be isometrically mapped to the plane because the cylinder has a different intrinsic geometry (it's a cylinder, while the plane is flat but unbounded). Wait, but if we only consider the cylinder with height 1, maybe we can map it to a strip in the plane. But the problem states that the bending Î maps M Ã [0,1] to âÂ³, and each M_t is a submanifold with boundary. So, if we could map the cylinder to a planar strip, then the bases would be planar. But the problem is whether this is the only possibility or if we can have non-planar bases.

But according to the problem's conditions, the bending must be an isometry, so the intrinsic geometry is preserved. Since the original cylinder is a developable surface, the only possible isometric bends are to other developable surfaces. Developable surfaces include cylinders, cones, and tangent developables. Cones have a singularity, so they are out. Tangent developables may have a parabolic line, but if the boundary is a smooth curve, perhaps it's allowed. In that case, the images of the original bases would be curves on the tangent developable. If the tangent developable is not a plane, then those curves would not be planar. However, is it possible to isometrically embed the cylinder into such a tangent developable?

Wait, but the cylinder is a compact surface, while a tangent developable (if it's not a plane) might not be compact. For example, the tangent developable of a line is the plane, which is not compact. The tangent developable of a parabola is a surface that extends to infinity, so it's not compact. Therefore, it's impossible to isometrically embed a compact cylinder into a non-compact surface. Therefore, the only possible developable surfaces that are compact and without singularities are cylinders. Therefore, any isometric bending of the cylinder must result in another cylinder, which would have planar bases. Therefore, the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar.

Wait, but earlier I thought about slant cylinders, which are developable and compact. A slant cylinder is still a cylinder, just not right. For example, if you take a cylinder where the circular bases are in parallel planes but the sides are slant, then it's a slant cylinder. However, such a cylinder is still a developable surface, and its bases are planar circles in parallel planes. Therefore, even in a slant cylinder, the bases are planar. Hence, any bending of M must result in a cylinder (possibly slant), and hence the bases must remain planar.

But wait, is a slant cylinder considered a cylinder in this context? Yes, because it's a developable surface generated by translating a line along a circular path. However, in a slant cylinder, the generators are not perpendicular to the bases. However, since the bases are still circles in parallel planes, they are planar. Therefore, even if the cylinder is slant, the bases are planar. Therefore, any bending of the original cylinder must result in a cylinder (developable surface), and hence the bases must remain planar.

But wait, earlier I considered a tangent developable that is compact. But if the original cylinder is compact, the only developable surfaces that are compact and smooth are cylinders. Cones are not compact, and tangent developables are not compact unless the curve is closed, but then they would have a singular point. Therefore, the only possibility is that the bending results in another cylinder, which must have planar bases.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the bases must remain planar.

But let me verify this with some references or theorems. I recall that the cylinder is a flat surface with zero curvature, and any isometric bending must preserve this flatness. The only flat surfaces in âÂ³ are planes and cylinders (developable surfaces). However, planes are not compact, so the cylinder cannot be bent into a plane. Therefore, the only isometric bends of the cylinder are other cylinders. Therefore, the bases must remain planar.

Alternatively, consider the fact that in an isometric bending, the principal curvatures must remain the same. For the cylinder, one principal curvature is zero (along the circular directions), and the other is 1/r, where r is the radius (assuming unit height). If you bend the cylinder, keeping it isometric, then the principal curvatures must remain the same. However, if you twist the cylinder into a slant cylinder, the principal curvatures would change. Wait, no. Wait, the principal curvatures depend on the extrinsic geometry. For a right circular cylinder, the principal curvatures are 0 and 1/r. If you twist it into a slant cylinder, the principal curvatures would change. Wait, but isometric bending preserves the intrinsic geometry (the metric), not necessarily the extrinsic curvatures. So, the extrinsic curvatures can change as long as the intrinsic metric is preserved.

But if you have a slant cylinder, its extrinsic curvatures would differ from the original. However, the intrinsic metric is still flat. Therefore, the slant cylinder is also a valid isometric bending. But in this case, the bases are still planar. So, even though the extrinsic geometry changes, the bases remain planar. Therefore, this suggests that the bases must remain planar, but the cylinder can be slant or right. However, the problem is asking whether the bases must remain planar. Since in a slant cylinder, the bases are planar, even though they are in different planes, the answer would still be yes.

But wait, the problem says ""the bases planar"", not necessarily in the same plane. So, if the bases are circles in different planes, they are still planar. Therefore, any isometric bending of the cylinder results in another developable surface, which must be a cylinder (right or slant), and hence the bases are planar. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But earlier I thought about a tangent developable, but since that's not compact, it's not possible. Therefore, the only possible isometric bends are cylinders, which have planar bases.

Therefore, the conclusion is that any bending of M must leave the bases planar.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if any bending of the manifold M must leave the bases planar. Let me start by understanding what exactly M is. The manifold M is described as all points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is between 0 and 2Ï, and z is between 0 and 1. So, this is essentially a cylinder, right? The Î¸ parameter sweeps out the circular part, and z is the height from 0 to 1. So, M is a cylinder with circular ends (at z=0 and z=1) and a height of 1.

Now, a bending of M is a smooth map Î from M Ã [0,1] to âÂ³, satisfying three conditions. First, for each t, Î[M Ã {t}] is a submanifold with boundary in âÂ³, called M_t. Second, when t=0, Î is just the identity map, so M_0 is M itself. Third, for every t, the map that takes m to Î(m,t) is an isometry between M and M_t. So, each M_t is isometric to M, meaning they have the same intrinsic geometryâsame lengths, angles, etc.

The question is whether such a bending must leave the bases planar. The bases are the circles at z=0 and z=1. Planar would mean they lie in a plane, which for a circle would just mean they are flat circles in some plane in 3D space. But since they are embedded in âÂ³, being planar just means they don't curve, right?

I need to determine if any isometric bending of the cylinder must have these bases remaining planar. Maybe I can think about the properties of the cylinder and how isometries affect it. Since the cylinder is a developable surface, it can be isometrically embedded in âÂ² without any stretching or tearing. But when you bend it in 3D space while preserving lengths, does that necessarily keep the bases planar?

Wait, if we bend the cylinder, we can twist it or perhaps make it into a different shape, but the key is that the isometry must preserve the metric. So, the lengths on the surface must stay the same. For the cylinder, the metric is flat except for the curvature around the circular direction. But since the cylinder can be developed into a flat rectangle in 2D, maybe any isometric bending corresponds to a development in âÂ³ that's isometric to the original cylinder.

But the problem is asking about the bases. The original bases are circles in the planes z=0 and z=1. If we bend the cylinder, can we twist it such that the bases become non-planar? For example, if we twist the cylinder so that each base is a helical curve, but that might not be planar. Wait, but if we twist the cylinder, the helical shape would not be a circle anymore. However, the problem states that each M_t is a submanifold with boundary. If we twist the cylinder, the boundary would still be two circles, but in different planes. Wait, but a helical boundary isn't a circle in a plane. So maybe that's not allowed?

Wait, the definition says that Î[M Ã {t}] is a submanifold with boundary. So, the boundary of M_t should be two circles, right? Because the boundary of M is the two circles at z=0 and z=1. So, when you isometrically bend the cylinder, the boundary should still be two circles. But if you twist the cylinder, the boundaries would still be circles, but in different planes. Wait, but if you twist the cylinder, the circles might not lie in parallel planes. Hmm.

Wait, if you take a cylinder and twist it, like a helical cylinder, the top and bottom circles would lie in planes that are not parallel. But does that preserve the isometry? Let me think. If you have a cylinder and you twist it, the metric along the circular direction changes? Wait, no. The intrinsic metric on the cylinder is determined by the circular parameter Î¸ and the height z. For an isometry, the metric must be preserved. So, if you twist the cylinder, you might change the extrinsic geometry, but the intrinsic metric is still Î¸Â² + dzÂ². Wait, no. If you twist the cylinder, the distance between two points might not be the same as in the original cylinder. Wait, but the problem states that the map m â Î(m,t) is an isometry between M and M_t, so the intrinsic metric is preserved. Therefore, the intrinsic geometry of M_t is the same as M, which is a cylinder with the metric dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². So, even if you twist the cylinder extrinsically, as long as the intrinsic metric is preserved, the extrinsic shape can vary, but the intrinsic distances remain the same.

But the question is about the bases. The original bases are circles in the planes z=0 and z=1. If we bend the cylinder, can the bases become non-planar? For example, if we bend the cylinder into a different shape where the bases are not in parallel planes. But if the bases are still circles, but in different planes, how does that affect their planarity?

Wait, a circle is a planar curve. If you have a circle in a plane, it's planar. If you have a circle in a non-planar surface, but the circle itself is a closed curve in 3D space, is that still considered planar? Wait, no. For a circle to be planar, all its points must lie in a single plane. If you take a circle and move it into a helical path, it's not lying in a plane anymore. But in the problem statement, the boundaries of M_t are the images of the original boundaries under Î. The original boundaries are circles in the planes z=0 and z=1. If we apply an isometry, which is a distance-preserving map, does that necessarily keep the boundaries in planes?

Wait, but an isometry of the cylinder as a surface doesn't necessarily correspond to an isometry of âÂ³. The isometry is of the manifold M, which is the cylinder, but the map Î is a bending in âÂ³. So, the isometry is between the intrinsic geometry of M and M_t, but the extrinsic embedding in âÂ³ can vary as long as the intrinsic metric is preserved.

But the problem is asking whether the bases must remain planar. The original bases are planar. If we bend the cylinder, can we make the bases non-planar?

Wait, if we have a bending where we twist the cylinder, such that the top and bottom circles are now in different planes, but still circles. For example, imagine taking the cylinder and rotating each circle around some axis, making them lie in different planes. However, if you do that, would the circles still be circles? If you rotate a circle around an axis, the resulting curve is a helix, not a circle. Wait, no. If you rotate a circle in 3D space around an axis, the image is a torus, but here we are talking about the boundaries. Wait, the boundaries are two circles. If you twist the cylinder, the top and bottom boundaries would be circles but in different planes. For example, if you twist the cylinder by an angle as you go up, then the top circle would be rotated relative to the bottom circle. But in that case, the top and bottom circles are still circles, just in different planes. However, are they still planar?

Wait, a circle is a planar curve. If you have a circle in 3D space, it lies in a plane. If you rotate a circle around an axis, you get another circle in a different plane. So, even if you twist the cylinder, the boundaries are still circles lying in planes, but those planes might not be parallel. So, their individual planarity is preserved, but the planes are not necessarily parallel. However, the question is about whether the bases must remain planar. If the bases are still circles lying in planes, then they are planar individually, but the problem might be asking whether they remain in the same plane as the original. Wait, the original bases are in the planes z=0 and z=1. If after bending, the bases are in different planes, then technically they are still planar, but just in different orientations. So, the question is whether the bending can make the bases non-planar, i.e., not lying in any plane. But since they are circles, they must lie in a plane. Therefore, the bases are always planar, but their planes can be different.

Wait, but the problem says ""must any bending of M leave the bases planar?"" If the bases are circles, they are planar by definition. So, unless the bending somehow deforms the circles into non-planar curves, but since the map is an isometry, the intrinsic metric is preserved. The boundary circles have a certain length, which is preserved. But can an isometry map a circle to a non-planar curve?

Wait, no. Because if you have a circle, which is a one-dimensional curve, and you apply an isometric embedding into âÂ³, the circle must still be a curve of the same length. However, an isometric embedding of a circle into âÂ³ can be any curve that is a circle in some plane, but if you want to make it non-planar, you would need a curve that is not lying in a plane but still has the same length. However, such a curve would not be a circle anymore. Wait, but the boundaries in the problem are the images of the original boundaries under Î, which are the circles at z=0 and z=1. So, if Î is an isometry, does that mean that the boundaries are mapped to curves of the same length? But the problem states that the map m â Î(m,t) is an isometry between M and M_t. Therefore, the boundaries of M_t are the images of the boundaries of M under Î. Since the boundaries of M are circles, the boundaries of M_t should be circles of the same length. But in âÂ³, a curve of length 2Ï (if the original circle has circumference 2Ï) could be a circle in some plane, but could it also be a non-planar curve?

Wait, in âÂ³, any space curve that is a circle must lie in a plane. Because a circle is defined as the set of points equidistant from a central point (the center) in some plane. So, if you have a curve in âÂ³ that is a circle of radius r, then it must lie in a plane. Therefore, the boundaries of M_t must still be circles lying in planes. Therefore, they are planar. So, even if you bend the cylinder, as long as the isometry is preserved, the boundaries must remain planar circles, possibly in different planes. Therefore, the answer would be yes, any bending of M must leave the bases planar.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we take the cylinder and twist it such that the top and bottom circles are in different planes, but still circles. For example, imagine taking the cylinder and rotating each vertical line segment (the generators of the cylinder) around the cylinder's axis, causing the top and bottom circles to be rotated relative to each other. In this case, the top and bottom circles are still circles but in different planes. However, since they are still circles, they are planar. So, their planarity is preserved, but their orientation in space changes. Therefore, the bases remain planar.

Alternatively, is there a way to bend the cylinder such that the bases are not circles anymore? But the problem states that the map is an isometry. The original boundaries are circles with circumference 2Ï (if the cylinder has radius 1). If we isometrically bend the cylinder, the boundaries must still have circumference 2Ï. But if the boundaries were not circles, but some other curves of length 2Ï, they would not be circles. However, in order for the extrinsic shape to have boundaries with the same circumference, but not circles, they would have to be non-planar. But wait, in âÂ³, can a closed curve of length 2Ï that is not a circle exist? Yes, but such a curve would not be a circle. However, the problem states that the map is an isometry between M and M_t. The boundary of M is a circle, so the boundary of M_t must be a curve of the same length (2Ï) and isometric to the original boundary. However, in the extrinsic space, the boundary is a curve, but the isometry is about the intrinsic metric. The intrinsic metric on the boundary is a circle with circumference 2Ï. But extrinsically, in âÂ³, the boundary could be any curve that is a circle with circumference 2Ï, which must lie in a plane. Therefore, the boundaries must still be circles in planes, hence planar.

Alternatively, if we consider that the boundary is a one-dimensional manifold, and the isometry preserves the metric on the boundary. The boundary of M is a circle with the standard metric, which has curvature 1 (since the circumference is 2Ï and the radius is 1). The boundary of M_t must have the same metric, which is a circle with curvature 1. In âÂ³, the only closed curves with this curvature are circles in planes. Therefore, the boundaries must remain planar circles.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bending of M must leave the bases planar. The bases are circles in planes, and their planarity is preserved under isometric bending.

But wait, let me check if there's another possibility. Suppose we have a cylinder that is bent into a different developable surface. For example, a cone or a tangent developable. However, the original cylinder has zero Gaussian curvature, and the cone has zero Gaussian curvature as well. But the cylinder is a developable surface, and so is a cone. However, the problem states that the bending must be an isometry between M and M_t. So, if we bend the cylinder into a cone, would that preserve the isometry?

Wait, a cone has a different metric. The original cylinder has a metric dsÂ² = dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². A cone, if you cut it along a generator and flatten it, becomes a sector of a circle. The metric on the cone is different; it's not flat. Therefore, bending the cylinder into a cone would not be an isometry, because the cone has a different intrinsic metric. Therefore, such a bending would not satisfy condition 3, which requires that the map is an isometry between M and M_t. Therefore, the only possible isometric bends of the cylinder are other cylinders, possibly with different orientations or positions in âÂ³, but still cylinders. Therefore, the boundaries must remain circles in planes, hence planar.

Therefore, the conclusion is that any bending of M must leave the bases planar.

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether any bending of the manifold M, as defined, must leave the bases planar. Let me start by understanding the problem better.

First, M is given by the set of points (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z) where Î¸ is between 0 and 2Ï, and z is between 0 and 1. So, geometrically, M is like a cylinder, right? The Î¸ parameterizes the circular direction, and z is the height. So, it's a cylinder with radius 1, height 1, and the circular base is at z=0 and the top at z=1. But wait, actually, since z is from 0 to 1, it's a cylinder standing vertically with both bases at z=0 and z=1. So, the two bases are circles in the planes z=0 and z=1.

A bending of M is a smooth map Î from M Ã [0,1] to âÂ³, satisfying three conditions:

1. For each t, Î(M Ã {t}) is a submanifold with boundary. So, each M_t is a surface in 3D space, possibly with boundary.

2. Î(m,0) = m, so at time t=0, the surface is just the original cylinder.

3. For each t, the map m â¦ Î(m,t) is an isometry between M and M_t. So, bending preserves the intrinsic metric of the cylinder; distances on the surface are preserved during the bending.

The question is whether such a bending must leave the bases planar. That is, after bending, are the two boundaries (the circles at z=0 and z=1) still lying on planes? Or can they become non-planar?

So, the problem is about whether isometric deformations of a cylinder can make the original circular bases non-planar. The answer might depend on the properties of isometric deformations of cylinders.

I know that cylinders are developable surfaces, meaning they can be unfolded into a plane without stretching. However, when you bend a cylinder, you might be able to twist it or something. Wait, but if you just twist it, would that preserve the planarity of the bases? Hmm.

Wait, let's think about specific examples. For instance, if you take a cylinder and twist it along its axis, like a helical motion, would that preserve the metric? Let me recall that in differential geometry, isometric deformations must preserve the first fundamental form, which includes the metric tensor. Twisting a cylinder might introduce a rotation, but does that affect the metric?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to bend the cylinder into a different shape where the bases are not planar. For example, if you imagine the cylinder being bent into a cone, but then the cone is not a submanifold with boundary unless it's a flat cone, but cones have a singularity at the tip, so maybe not applicable here.

Wait, but the problem requires that each M_t is a submanifold with boundary. So, it can't have a singularity. So, cones with a tip would not qualify because the tip isn't a submanifold. Similarly, a cylinder being bent into a different cylinder, but rotated, like a helical cylinder. Is that possible?

Wait, but a helical cylinder is just another cylinder, just rotated. If you have a right circular cylinder and you rotate it, then the metric is preserved? No, rotating the cylinder would not change the intrinsic metric. Wait, the metric is preserved under isometries, which include rotations. So, if you rotate the cylinder, the metric remains the same. But in that case, the bases are still circles in planes (z=0 and z=1), but rotated. So, they are still planar. So, rotating the cylinder doesn't make the bases non-planar.

Alternatively, what if you perform a more complicated bending? For example, bending the cylinder into a different shape where the height varies. But the problem states that the map must be an isometry. So, the lengths on the surface must remain the same. For the cylinder, the metric is flat with a metric tensor that has components (1, 1, 0) in the Î¸ and z directions. So, if you bend the cylinder isometrically, you can't stretch or shrink the distances. So, the cylinder can be isometrically bent into another cylinder of the same height but possibly different radii? Wait, no. Wait, the total area must be preserved. The area of the original cylinder is 2Ïr * height. If you change the radius, the area would change. But since the isometry preserves the metric, the area should be preserved. Wait, but the original cylinder has radius 1 and height 1, so area 2Ï*1*1=2Ï. If you bend it into another cylinder with radius r and height h, then the area would be 2Ïr*h, which must equal 2Ï. So, r*h=1. So, you can have different radii and heights as long as their product is 1. But in that case, the metric would change unless r=1 and h=1. Wait, no. Wait, the metric on the cylinder is (dÎ¸)^2 + (dz)^2. If you have another cylinder with radius r and height h, the metric would be (dÎ¸)^2 + (dr dÏ)^2? Wait, no. Wait, for a cylinder parameterized by Î¸ and z, if you have another cylinder with radius r, then the metric would be (dÎ¸)^2 + (dr)^2, but that's a different parameterization. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.

Wait, perhaps it's better to think of the cylinder as a product of a circle and an interval. The first fundamental form is (dÎ¸)^2 + (dz)^2. An isometry would preserve this. So, if you can bend the cylinder into another surface where the metric is still (dÎ¸)^2 + (dz)^2, but embedded differently in âÂ³. For example, a cylinder of radius r and height h with r*h=1. But in that case, the metric would still be (dÎ¸)^2 + (dz)^2, just scaled. Wait, no. Wait, if you have a cylinder with radius r, then the metric in terms of Î¸ and z would be (dÎ¸)^2 + (r dz)^2. So, unless r=1, the metric is different. Therefore, to preserve the metric, you can only have r=1 and h=1. Therefore, the only isometric bending of the cylinder would be another cylinder of the same radius and height, but possibly rotated or something. But rotating doesn't affect the planarity of the bases.

Wait, but maybe there's another way to bend the cylinder into a different shape where the metric is preserved but the embedding is different. For example, a helicoidal cylinder. Let me think. A helicoidal cylinder is a cylinder that is helically twisted. However, the metric on a helicoidal cylinder would still be (dÎ¸)^2 + (dz)^2, but the embedding in âÂ³ is different. Wait, but in reality, a helicoidal cylinder is not a flat surface. Wait, no, actually, if you have a right circular cylinder, it's flat, but if you have a helicoidal cylinder, is it still flat?

Wait, maybe I need to recall that the only isometric deformations of a flat cylinder are other flat cylinders. But is that true? Wait, in differential geometry, a cylinder is a developable surface, so it can be isometrically bent into a plane. But if you glue the two ends together, it becomes a torus, but that's different. Wait, but in our case, the cylinder is not a closed surface; it has boundaries at z=0 and z=1. So, if you try to isometrically bend it into another surface, what possibilities are there?

Alternatively, maybe the cylinder can be bent into a different flat surface. For example, if you take a cylinder and bend it into another cylinder with the same height but different radius, but scaled down and up. Wait, but the area must stay the same. Wait, area is 2Ïrh. If you change r, you have to change h such that rh=1. So, for example, if you make the radius 2, then the height would have to be 1/2. But then the metric would be (dÎ¸)^2 + (2 dz)^2, which is not the same as the original (dÎ¸)^2 + (dz)^2. Therefore, such a bending would not preserve the metric. Therefore, the only isometric bending is when r and h are kept the same. Therefore, the cylinder can only be rotated or shifted in space without changing its shape. Therefore, the bases would remain planar.

But wait, maybe there's a way to twist the cylinder such that the metric is preserved. For example, if you have a cylinder that is twisted along its axis, like a spiral, but keeping the same radius and height. Let me think. Suppose you parameterize the cylinder as (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z), but then you rotate the z-coordinate as Î¸ increases. So, perhaps (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + Î±Î¸). Wait, but this would make the surface non-cylinder anymore, right? Because the vertical coordinate depends on Î¸. However, the metric on such a surface would be (dÎ¸)^2 + (dz)^2, but with z replaced by z + Î±Î¸. Wait, but the differential dz would be dz + Î± dÎ¸, so the metric would become (dÎ¸)^2 + (dz + Î± dÎ¸)^2 = (1 + Î±Â²) dÎ¸Â² + 2Î± dÎ¸ dz + dzÂ². Which is different from the original metric. Therefore, such a twisting would not preserve the metric. Therefore, that's not an isometry.

Therefore, perhaps the only isometric deformations are those that correspond to rotations or translations. But translations don't affect the shape. Rotations would just rotate the cylinder in space, keeping the bases planar. So, in that case, the bases remain planar.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to bend the cylinder. For example, bending it into a cylinder that's not straight. Wait, but if you bend a cylinder into a curved cylinder, like a helical cylinder, but maintaining the same radius and height, would that preserve the metric? Wait, earlier I considered parameterizing it as (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, z + Î±Î¸), but that introduced a cross term in the metric. Therefore, that's not isometric.

Alternatively, if you have a cylinder that's bent into a different cylinder with the same radius and height but in a different orientation. For example, rotating the cylinder around one of the axes. But again, that would just be a rigid motion, preserving the metric.

Alternatively, maybe you can curve the cylinder into a conic shape, but maintaining the metric. Wait, but a cone has a different metric. A cone with a circular base is not flat unless it's a right circular cone with zero cone angle. Wait, a flat cone would be a cylinder. Wait, cones with a cone angle greater than zero have a conical metric, which is different from the flat cylinder metric. Therefore, you can't isometrically bend a cylinder into a cone with a non-zero cone angle because the metrics would differ.

Therefore, maybe the only isometric deformations are those that leave the cylinder as a cylinder, possibly rotated or translated. Therefore, the bases remain planar.

But wait, let's think about the problem statement again. The bending is a smooth map from M Ã [0,1] to âÂ³, such that for each t, M_t is a submanifold with boundary. So, the deformation is continuous in t, and each M_t is a surface with boundary. The key point is whether the boundaries (the circles at z=0 and z=1) can become non-planar during this deformation.

If the isometry preserves the metric, then the boundaries are circles with the same circumference, right? Because the circumference of the original circle is 2Ï, and the metric is preserved, so the circumference must remain 2Ï. Therefore, the boundary curves must remain circles of circumference 2Ï. However, a circle with circumference 2Ï can be embedded in space in various ways, not necessarily lying on a plane. For example, a circle can be a latitude on a sphere, or a helical circle, etc. However, in those cases, the metric on the circle would change if the circle is not embedded in a plane. Wait, but the boundary of the cylinder is a circle with the induced metric from the cylinder. Wait, the induced metric on the boundary circle is the one-dimensional metric dsÂ² = (dÎ¸)^2, since the boundary is a circle parameterized by Î¸ with z fixed. So, the length of the boundary is 2Ï. If we deform the cylinder isometrically, the boundary's metric must remain dsÂ² = (dÎ¸)^2, so the circumference is still 2Ï, but how is it embedded in space?

Wait, but the problem is asking whether the boundaries must remain planar. So, even though the metric on the boundary is preserved as a circle of circumference 2Ï, the actual embedding in space could be non-planar. For example, you could have the boundary circle lying on a sphere or another surface. However, the problem states that M_t must be a submanifold with boundary. So, the boundary is a 1-dimensional submanifold, which is just a curve. So, in principle, the boundary can be any curve that is a circle of circumference 2Ï, not necessarily lying on a plane.

But does the isometry force the boundary to lie on a plane? Let's think. Suppose we have an isometric bending of the cylinder. The original cylinder has two circular boundaries of circumference 2Ï in the planes z=0 and z=1. If we bend the cylinder isometrically, can the boundaries become, say, circles on a cylinder of radius r and height h with r*h=1, but placed in space in a way that the boundaries are not on planes?

Wait, but if you have a cylinder with radius r and height h = 1/r, then the boundary circles would have circumference 2Ïr. But in our case, the circumference must remain 2Ï, so 2Ïr = 2Ï â r=1. Therefore, the only way to have the boundaries as circles of circumference 2Ï is to have r=1 and h=1, which is the original cylinder. Therefore, maybe the only isometric bending is the original cylinder. But that can't be right, because you can rotate the cylinder in space, keeping the metric the same.

Wait, but rotating the cylinder doesn't change the fact that the boundaries are planar. So, even though you can rotate the cylinder, the boundaries remain planar. Therefore, maybe any isometric bending of the cylinder must keep the boundaries planar.

Alternatively, is there a way to bend the cylinder such that the boundaries are not planar? Let's try to imagine. Suppose you take the cylinder and twist it such that the top boundary circle is rotated relative to the bottom one. But in doing so, would the metric be preserved? Let's see. If you have a twist, then the vertical coordinate z is combined with Î¸. For example, maybe parameterize the surface as (cos(Î¸ + Ï(z)), sin(Î¸ + Ï(z)), z). If Ï(z) is a function that depends on z, then the metric would be (dÎ¸ + Ï'(z) dz)^2 + (dz)^2. Which would be (1 + (Ï'(z))Â²) dÎ¸Â² + 2Ï'(z) dÎ¸ dz + dzÂ². Comparing to the original metric (dÎ¸)^2 + (dz)^2, unless Ï'(z) = 0, which would mean no twist, the metric is different. Therefore, such a twisting would not be an isometry. Therefore, the only isometric deformations are those without twisting.

Alternatively, maybe bending the cylinder into a helicoidal shape. Wait, but a helicoidal cylinder is not flat. Wait, let me think. A helicoidal surface is a surface generated by a helix. The metric on a helicoidal surface is not flat. Therefore, you cannot isometrically bend a flat cylinder into a helicoidal surface because the metrics differ.

Another approach: The cylinder is a developable surface, meaning it can be isometrically embedded into a plane. So, you can unfold it into a rectangle in the plane. However, when you try to bend it into another surface, you need to check if the boundary remains planar.

Wait, but if you develop the cylinder into a plane, the boundaries become straight lines of length 2Ï. But when you fold it back into a cylinder, the boundaries become circles. However, if you isometrically bend the cylinder, the boundaries can be different curves as long as they have the same circumference. But the question is whether they must lie on a plane.

Wait, in the plane, the boundary is a straight line segment. But when you fold it into a cylinder, it becomes a circle. However, in the problem, the original cylinder's boundaries are circles in planes. If we bend the cylinder isometrically, can the boundaries become circles in non-planar positions? For example, circles lying on a sphere or another cylinder.

But as I thought earlier, if we have a boundary circle with circumference 2Ï, it can be embedded in various ways. However, the problem states that M_t must be a submanifold with boundary. So, the boundary is a 1-dimensional submanifold, which is a smooth curve. However, the condition that the map is an isometry between M and M_t imposes that the induced metric on the boundary is the same as the original. The original boundary has the metric dsÂ² = (dÎ¸)^2, so the length element is dÎ¸. Therefore, the boundary must be a curve parameterized by Î¸ with length 2Ï. But the way it's embedded in space can vary, as long as it's a circle of circumference 2Ï. However, can such a circle be non-planar?

Yes, for example, a circle can be a latitude on a sphere, or a helical circle on a cylinder. However, in those cases, the metric on the boundary would still be dsÂ² = (dÎ¸)^2. Wait, is that true? Let's check.

Suppose we have a circle parameterized by Î¸, lying on a sphere of radius R. The latitude at angle Ï has circumference 2ÏR cosÏ. If we set this equal to 2Ï, then R cosÏ = 1. So, if R=1, then Ï=0, which is the equator. If R>1, then cosÏ=1/R, so Ï=arccos(1/R). So, such a circle is a latitude on the sphere. But the metric on the latitude is inherited from the sphere's metric. However, the sphere's metric is not flat, so the induced metric on the latitude is different from the flat circle metric. Wait, no. Wait, the sphere has a Riemannian metric, but the induced metric on the latitude is just dsÂ² = RÂ² cosÂ²Ï dÎ¸Â². So, if we want this to be equal to dsÂ² = (dÎ¸)^2, we would need RÂ² cosÂ²Ï = 1. Therefore, R cosÏ = 1. So, if we take R=1 and Ï=0, that's the equator, which is flat. If Râ 1, then even though the circumference is 2Ï, the induced metric is different. Therefore, only the equator on the sphere has the same induced metric as the original cylinder's boundary. Therefore, if we want the boundary to have the same metric, it must be a flat circle, which can only be embedded in a plane.

Wait, but is that necessarily true? Suppose we have a different embedding. For example, imagine a circle that is not in a plane but still has the metric dsÂ² = (dÎ¸)^2. Is that possible?

In general, a 1-dimensional manifold (a circle) has a 1-dimensional metric, which is just a scalar multiple of dÎ¸Â². However, when embedded in higher dimensions, the induced metric can be different. For example, if you have a circle parameterized by Î¸, and you embed it in 3D space as a helix, the induced metric would be different. However, if you have a circle in a plane, the induced metric is dÎ¸Â². If you have a circle in a cone, the induced metric would be different. Therefore, the only way to have the induced metric be dÎ¸Â² is to have the circle lie in a plane. Otherwise, the induced metric would have a different coefficient.

Therefore, if we require that the induced metric on the boundary is the same as the original, which is dÎ¸Â², then the boundary must lie in a plane. Therefore, the answer is yes: any bending of M must leave the bases planar.

But wait, let me verify this reasoning. Suppose we have a boundary circle with the induced metric dÎ¸Â². If the circle is not planar, then the induced metric would not be dÎ¸Â². For example, if the circle is a latitude on a sphere, the induced metric is different. If the circle is a helix, the induced metric is different. Therefore, the only way for the induced metric to remain dÎ¸Â² is if the circle is embedded in a plane. Therefore, the boundaries must remain planar.

Therefore, the answer is yes: any bending of M must leave the bases planar.

But wait, let me check if there's a theorem that states this. In differential geometry, a circle with a flat metric (i.e., the metric is just dÎ¸Â²) must be embedded in a plane. Is that a theorem?

Yes, in general, a 1-dimensional manifold with a flat metric is isometric to a circle embedded in the plane. However, in higher dimensions, you can have isometric embeddings of a circle with the same metric in non-planar ways. Wait, but if the induced metric is dÎ¸Â², then the circle is isometric to the standard circle in the plane. Therefore, by the uniqueness of isometric embeddings of 1-dimensional manifolds, any isometric embedding of a circle with the metric dÎ¸Â² must be congruent to the standard circle in the plane. Therefore, the boundaries must remain planar.

Therefore, the answer is yes: any bending of M must leave the bases planar.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if any bending of the manifold M must leave the bases planar. Let me start by understanding the problem.

First, M is a cylinder. Its points are parameterized by Î¸ and z, where Î¸ goes from 0 to 2Ï and z from 0 to 1. So it's like a cylinder with radius 1, height 1, and the bases at z=0 and z=1 are circles. Now, a bending of M is a smooth map Î that takes M Ã [0,1] to RÂ³. The conditions are:

1. For each t, Î[M Ã {t}] is a submanifold with boundary M_t.
2. At t=0, Î is the identity map on M.
3. For each t, the map from M to M_t is an isometry.

The question is whether any such bending must leave the bases planar. So, the bases are the circles at z=0 and z=1. If the bending is applied, do these circles stay in their original planes (z=0 and z=1) or can they be bent out of their planes?

Hmm. Let's think about isometries. An isometry preserves the intrinsic metric of the surface. So, when you bend the cylinder, the distances between points on the surface must stay the same. The cylinder is a developable surface, meaning it can be flattened into a plane without stretching or tearing. The intrinsic metric of the cylinder is the same as that of a flat strip (a rectangle), which is why you can bend it into a cylinder. So, any isometric bending must preserve the intrinsic geometry.

But the question is about the extrinsic shape. The bases, which are circles, are embedded in the 3D space. If we bend the cylinder, can the circles become non-planar? Intuitively, if you twist the cylinder, the circles might become helices or something. But does that preserve the isometry?

Wait, twisting a cylinder does not preserve the isometry. A twist would introduce a non-zero Gaussian curvature, right? Because a twisted cylinder is not developable. Wait, no. Actually, a cylinder can be twisted without changing its Gaussian curvature. Wait, but the Gaussian curvature of a cylinder is zero. So if you twist it, is the Gaussian curvature still zero? Let me recall.

Gaussian curvature is the product of the principal curvatures. For a cylinder, the principal curvatures are 0 and 1/r (for a cylinder of radius r). So Gaussian curvature is zero. If you twist the cylinder, does that affect the principal curvatures? Hmm. Let's think. If you take a right circular cylinder and twist it, say, into a helical shape, does the Gaussian curvature remain zero?

Wait, maybe. Because twisting doesn't stretch the surface, it just rotates it around the axis. So the extrinsic curvature (the mean curvature) might change, but the Gaussian curvature should stay zero. Because Gaussian curvature depends only on the intrinsic metric, and twisting doesn't change the intrinsic metric. So if you twist the cylinder, it's still a developable surface with zero Gaussian curvature, just parameterized differently.

But in that case, if you twist the cylinder, the bases would no longer be in the same plane. For example, if you twist the cylinder so that each vertical line becomes a helix, then the circle at the bottom would be twisted into a helical circle, which is not planar. But is that an isometric bending?

Wait, but how does twisting preserve the isometry? Let me think. If you take a rectangle (the flat strip) and roll it into a cylinder, that's isometric. But if you then twist the cylinder, is that still isometric?

I think yes. Because twisting doesn't stretch or compress the surface. So you can have an isometric twisting of the cylinder. So in that case, the bases would become non-planar. But the problem states that any bending of M must leave the bases planar. So maybe my initial thought is wrong.

Wait, but the problem says that the map Î is a smooth map, and for each t, the map from M to M_t is an isometry. So if we can twist the cylinder isometrically, then the bases would not be planar. Therefore, the answer would be no, the bending does not have to leave the bases planar. But the question is asking ""Must any bending of M leave the bases planar?"" So if there exists a bending where the bases are not planar, then the answer is no. But does such a bending exist?

Alternatively, maybe the bases must remain planar because of some topological constraints. Let me think. The bases are circles. If we have an isometric map of the cylinder, can we move the circles out of their planes?

Wait, for a cylinder, the bases are both circles of radius 1. If we bend the cylinder into another cylinder with the same radius, the bases would still be planar. But if we twist it, the bases would be helical. But is that possible with an isometry?

Wait, actually, a twisted cylinder is called a helicoidal cylinder. But is a helicoidal cylinder isometric to the standard cylinder? Let me recall some differential geometry.

In general, a surface is isometric to another if their first fundamental forms are the same. For a cylinder, the first fundamental form in coordinates (Î¸, z) is dÎ¸Â² + dzÂ². If you twist the cylinder, does the first fundamental form change?

Wait, if you take a parametrization of the twisted cylinder, say:

x(Î¸, z) = cos(Î¸ + Î± z)
y(Î¸, z) = sin(Î¸ + Î± z)
z = z

where Î± is the twist parameter. Then the first fundamental form would be:

E = (dx/dÎ¸)^2 + (dy/dÎ¸)^2 = ( -sin(Î¸ + Î± z) )Â² + (cos(Î¸ + Î± z) )Â² = 1

F = (dx/dÎ¸)(dz/dÎ¸) + (dy/dÎ¸)(dz/dÎ¸) = 0

G = (dz/dÎ¸)^2 + (dz/dz)^2 = 1

Wait, so even with the twist, the first fundamental form is still the same. Therefore, the twisted cylinder is isometric to the standard cylinder. Therefore, such a twist is an isometric bending. Therefore, the bases of the twisted cylinder would be circles that are helical, hence not lying in a plane. Therefore, the bases are not planar. Therefore, the answer would be no, there exists a bending where the bases are not planar, hence it's not necessary.

But wait, the problem says ""Must any bending of M leave the bases planar?"" So if there exists a bending that doesn't leave them planar, then the answer is no. But maybe there are constraints that prevent this?

Wait, but according to the above, twisting the cylinder is an isometric bending, so the answer is no. But let me check again.

Wait, in the parametrization I gave, when you twist the cylinder, each helix has a constant radius, so the base is still a circle of radius 1, but it's lifted along the z-axis as you go around. Wait, but the base is the set of points when z=0. So for z=0, the points are (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0), which is still the original circle. Similarly, for z=1, it's (cos(Î¸ + Î±), sin(Î¸ + Î±), 1). So that's also a circle in the plane z=1, but rotated by Î±. So actually, even if you twist the cylinder, the bases are still circles in their respective planes. Wait, that seems conflicting with my previous thought.

Wait, in that parametrization, the base at z=0 is (cosÎ¸, sinÎ¸, 0), which is the unit circle in the plane z=0. The top base is (cos(Î¸ + Î±), sin(Î¸ + Î±), 1), which is the unit circle in the plane z=1, but rotated by Î±. So even though the cylinder is twisted, the bases are still planar. So in this case, the bases remain planar. Therefore, maybe twisting doesn't make the bases non-planar.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. If you imagine twisting a cylinder, you might think the top circle is rotated relative to the bottom, but in 3D space, rotating a circle in its plane doesn't make it non-planar. The plane z=1 is still a plane, so rotating the circle doesn't take it out of the plane. Therefore, even a twisted cylinder has planar bases. Therefore, perhaps any isometric bending of the cylinder must keep the bases planar.

But wait, then why does the parametrization I gave earlier with a twist have the top circle rotated? Because it's just a rotation of the coordinate system. The plane z=1 is still there, so the circle is still in that plane, just rotated. Therefore, the bases are still planar.

Hmm. So maybe the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar. But then why does the problem ask if they must? Maybe there's another way to bend the cylinder where the bases are not planar.

Wait, perhaps if you bend the cylinder into a different shape. For example, if you take a cylinder and bend it into a cone. But a cone is not isometric to a cylinder. The Gaussian curvature of a cone is zero at all points except the tip, which is a singularity. So that's not an isometric bending.

Alternatively, if you take a cylinder and bend it into a more complex shape. But since the cylinder is flat, any isometric bending must be developable. So it can be rolled into another cylinder or unrolled into a flat strip. But is there a way to isometrically bend it such that the bases are not planar?

Wait, perhaps if you take the cylinder and bend it into a helicoidal surface. Wait, but as above, even a twisted cylinder has planar bases.

Alternatively, if you take the cylinder and bend it into a different cylinder with a different radius. But then the bases would have different radii, but they are still planar. So even if you scale the cylinder, the bases are planar.

Alternatively, if you take the cylinder and bend it into a different shape, but not another cylinder. For example, a cylinder can be isometrically bent into a sphere? No, because a sphere has constant positive curvature, whereas the cylinder has zero curvature.

Wait, but according to the isometric bending, the extrinsic geometry can change, but the intrinsic geometry (the first fundamental form) remains the same. So the cylinder's intrinsic geometry is flat, so it can only be bent into another flat surface, i.e., another cylinder or a flat strip. So maybe the only isometric bendings of the cylinder are cylinders and the flat strip. Therefore, the bases would always be planar.

But wait, a flat strip is just the cylinder unrolled, so the bases are straight lines. Wait, no. The flat strip is a rectangle, which when rolled into a cylinder, the two vertical sides become the circles. So if you unroll it, the bases of the cylinder become the two vertical sides of the rectangle, which are straight lines. But in 3D, the original cylinder has circular bases.

Wait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.

The cylinder M has two circular bases at z=0 and z=1. When you bend it isometrically, the bases must remain circles? Because the isometry preserves the intrinsic geometry, so the circles should stay circles. But in 3D space, if you bend the cylinder, can you deform the circles into non-planar circles?

Wait, but a circle in 3D space is a planar curve. To have a non-planar circle, you would need a curve that is not planar, but still has constant radius. However, such curves are called ""non-planar circles,"" but they are not actually circles in the usual sense. Wait, no. A circle is defined as a set of points equidistant from a central point, which requires the circle to lie in a plane. If you have a non-planar curve with all points at the same distance from a central point, it's not a circle anymore; it's like a helix or something else.

Therefore, if the bases are to remain circles, they must lie in a plane. Therefore, any isometric bending that maps the cylinder to another surface must preserve the circles as circles, hence planar.

But wait, in the twisted cylinder example, the bases are still circles in their respective planes, just rotated. So even though the cylinder is twisted, the bases are still planar. Therefore, perhaps all isometric bendings of the cylinder keep the bases planar.

But then, why does the problem ask if they must? Maybe there's a different way to bend the cylinder where the bases are not circles anymore. But since the isometry preserves the intrinsic metric, which includes the lengths along the cylinder and around the cylinder, the circles must remain circles.

Wait, the cylinder's intrinsic metric is such that the circumference is 2Ï, and the height is 1. If you bend it into another cylinder with the same circumference and height, then the bases would still be circles. If you unroll it into a flat strip, the bases become straight lines, but in 3D, the original bases are circles. Wait, no. When you unroll the cylinder into a flat strip, the circles become the two vertical sides of the rectangle. So in that case, the bases are no longer circles but straight lines. But in that case, the bending is not keeping the bases as submanifolds with boundary.

Wait, the problem states that for each t, Î[M Ã {t}] is a submanifold with boundary. So if you unroll it into a flat strip, the image would be a rectangle in the plane, which is a submanifold with boundary. But the original bases (circles) become the sides of the rectangle, which are straight lines. But in that case, the boundaries (the sides of the rectangle) are not circles anymore. However, in the problem, the bases are defined as z=0 and z=1. When you unroll the cylinder into a rectangle, the original bases become the left and right sides of the rectangle, which are straight lines. Therefore, in that case, the bases are not planar circles anymore; they are straight lines. But wait, straight lines are planar, but they are not circles. So in this case, the bases are not circles anymore. But the problem says ""the bases planar"". The bases are the circles at z=0 and z=1. If you unroll the cylinder, these bases become straight lines, which are planar but not circles. Therefore, in this case, the bases are planar but not circles. But the problem is asking if the bases must remain planar. Even if they become straight lines, which are planar, then the answer is yes. But if they can become non-planar, then no.

Wait, but in the unrolled case, the bases become straight lines, which are planar. So in this case, they are still planar. Therefore, even when you unroll the cylinder, the bases are planar. Wait, but straight lines are planar, so they are still in a plane. Therefore, in any case, whether you twist the cylinder or unroll it, the bases remain planar. Therefore, the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar.

But wait, when you unroll the cylinder, the bases become the sides of the rectangle, which are straight lines. But the original bases were circles. So in the unrolled case, the bases are no longer circles, but straight lines. However, the problem states that the bending must map M to M_t, which is a submanifold with boundary. In the case of the unrolled cylinder (a rectangle), the boundaries are the two vertical sides, which are straight lines, hence planar. Therefore, even though the shape of the base changes from a circle to a straight line, it's still a planar curve. Therefore, in all isometric bendings, the bases must remain planar.

But then why does the problem ask this? Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, let's think about the cylinder's fundamental group. The cylinder has a fundamental group isomorphic to Z, generated by a loop around the cylinder. If you twist the cylinder, does the fundamental group change? No, it remains Z. The unrolling into a rectangle also preserves the fundamental group. So maybe the planarity is enforced by the fundamental group.

Alternatively, consider the holonomy of the cylinder. The cylinder is a flat surface with a flat connection. When you roll it into a cylinder, you introduce a monodromy around the cylinder. If you twist it, does that affect the holonomy? I think not, because the holonomy is determined by the intrinsic geometry.

Wait, but if you twist the cylinder, the holonomy around the cylinder is still the same. So the twisting doesn't affect the holonomy. Therefore, the only isometric bendings are those that preserve the flat structure, hence must be cylinders or flat strips.

But in that case, the bases are either circles or straight lines, both planar. Therefore, in any case, the bases remain planar.

Therefore, perhaps the answer is yes, the bases must remain planar.

But I need to verify this with some references or more careful analysis.

Let me recall that a developable surface is one that can be isometrically embedded in 3D space without distortion. The cylinder is a classic example. The only isometric deformations of a developable surface are those that preserve its flatness, hence they can be rolled into another cylinder, unrolled into a flat strip, or other developable surfaces. However, any developable surface is a surface with zero Gaussian curvature, and hence can be isometrically bent into another developable surface.

But for the cylinder, the only developable surfaces it can be bent into are another cylinder or a flat strip. Because other developable surfaces, like cones or tangent developables, have different topologies. A cone is a developable surface, but it has a singularity at the tip. A tangent developable is a surface generated by moving a line along a curve, but it's not suitable here because our manifold M is a cylinder with boundary, and the tangent developable would not have the same boundary structure.

Therefore, the only isometric bendings of M are into another cylinder (possibly with different radii but same height) or a flat strip. In both cases, the bases are planar. If you bend it into a flat strip, the bases become straight lines, which are planar. If you bend it into another cylinder, the bases are circles in their respective planes. Therefore, in all cases, the bases must remain planar.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, any bending of M must leave the bases planar.

But wait, earlier I thought of a twisted cylinder, but in that case, the bases are still circles in their planes. So the bases are planar. Therefore, even with twisting, the bases are planar. Therefore, all isometric bendings keep the bases planar.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But let me check again. Suppose I have a cylinder and I twist it. The bases are circles in the planes z=0 and z=1. The twisting doesn't move the z-coordinate of the bases, so they remain in their original planes. Even though the circles are rotated relative to each other, they are still in their respective planes. Therefore, the bases are planar.

Therefore, in all isometric bendings of the cylinder, the bases must remain planar. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But then why does the problem ask this? Maybe I'm missing some subtlety.

Wait, another idea: if you take the cylinder and bend it into a different shape where the bases are not in their original planes. For example, if you take the cylinder and lift it vertically, but that would not be an isometry. Because lifting would stretch the surface. Similarly, if you compress it, that would also not be an isometry.

Alternatively, if you take the cylinder and bend it into a helical shape where the z-coordinate is also changing. Wait, but that would affect the intrinsic metric. For example, if you have a helicoidal surface, the first fundamental form might change.

Wait, let's parametrize a helicoidal cylinder. Suppose:

x(Î¸, z) = cosÎ¸
y(Î¸, z) = sinÎ¸
z(Î¸, z) = z + Î±Î¸

But this is not a cylinder anymore. The z-coordinate depends on Î¸, so it's not a cylinder. The surface would be a helicoid, but a helicoid is not a cylinder. The Gaussian curvature of a helicoid is zero, but it's not isometric to a cylinder because the first fundamental form is different. Let me check:

For the helicoidal parametrization:

x = cosÎ¸
y = sinÎ¸
z = z + Î±Î¸

The partial derivatives:

dx/dÎ¸ = -sinÎ¸
dy/dÎ¸ = cosÎ¸
dz/dÎ¸ = Î±

dx/dz = 0
dy/dz = 0
dz/dz = 1

Therefore, the first fundamental form is:

E = (dx/dÎ¸)^2 + (dy/dÎ¸)^2 + (dz/dÎ¸)^2 = sinÂ²Î¸ + cosÂ²Î¸ + Î±Â² = 1 + Î±Â²

F = dx/dÎ¸ * dx/dz + dy/dÎ¸ * dy/dz + dz/dÎ¸ * dz/dz = 0 + 0 + Î±*1 = Î±

G = (dx/dz)^2 + (dy/dz)^2 + (dz/dz)^2 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

So the first fundamental form is E = 1 + Î±Â², F = Î±, G = 1. Which is different from the cylinder's E = 1, F = 0, G = 1. Therefore, a helicoid is not isometric to a cylinder. Therefore, you cannot isometrically bend a cylinder into a helicoid.

Therefore, the only isometric bendings of the cylinder are into another cylinder or a flat strip. Therefore, the bases must remain planar.

Therefore, the answer is yes, any bending of M must leave the bases planar.

But let me see another approach. Suppose we consider the cylinder as a quotient space of the plane. The cylinder can be represented as RÂ² / (Î¸ â¼ Î¸ + 2Ï), where Î¸ is the angular coordinate. An isometric bending would correspond to an isometry of the plane that preserves the equivalence relation. The only such isometries are translations along the z-axis and rotations around the cylinder. Therefore, any isometric bending would either shift the cylinder vertically (preserving the planarity of the bases) or rotate it (which also keeps the bases planar). Therefore, the bases cannot be bent out of their planes.

Another perspective: the base circles are closed geodesics on the cylinder. Since isometries preserve geodesics, the images of the base circles under the isometry must still be closed geodesics on M_t. In the Euclidean space, the only closed geodesics are circles in planes or straight lines. But since the bases are circles, which are the only closed geodesics with constant curvature, their images must also be circles lying in planes. Therefore, the bases must remain planar.

Therefore, combining all these arguments, the answer is yes.

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Thus, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\). Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. The series is an infinite sum starting from r=1, and each term involves \\( 2^r \\) divided by \\( r \\) and \\( (3n+2)^r \\). The question is asking for the coefficient of \\( 1/n^4 \\) when this series is expanded in terms of \\( n \\).

First, I need to recall how to handle such series. Maybe I can express the sum in a closed form first, and then expand it as a power series in \\( 1/n \\). Let's see. The given series resembles the expansion of a logarithm. The general formula for \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} \\) is \\( -\\ln(1 - x) \\), right? So if I can manipulate the given series into that form, maybe I can use that identity.

Looking at the given series: \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\). Let me factor out the constants. Let's write \\( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\) as \\( x \\). Then each term becomes \\( \\frac{(2/(3n+2))^r}{r} \\), which is exactly the form of the logarithm series. So maybe the sum is equal to \\( -\\ln(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}) \\). Let me check that.

Yes, because \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\) for \\( |x| < 1 \\). In our case, \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\). So as long as \\( | \\frac{2}{3n + 2} | < 1 \\), which is true for sufficiently large n, the series converges. Therefore, the sum S can be written as:

\\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right) \\)

Now, I need to simplify this expression. Let's compute the argument inside the logarithm:

\\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{(3n + 2) - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\)

So,

\\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) \\)

Which simplifies to:

\\( S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n} \\right) \\)

Okay, so now the problem reduces to expanding \\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n} \\right) \\) into a power series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) and finding the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\).

The Taylor series expansion for \\( \\ln(1 + x) \\) around x=0 is:

\\( \\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\)

In our case, \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\). Substituting, we get:

\\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n} \\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2)^2}{2 \\cdot (3n)^2} + \\frac{(2)^3}{3 \\cdot (3n)^3} - \\frac{(2)^4}{4 \\cdot (3n)^4} + \\cdots \\)

Let me compute each term step by step.

First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)

Second term: \\( - \\frac{4}{2 \\cdot 9n^2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)

Third term: \\( \\frac{8}{3 \\cdot 27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)

Fourth term: \\( - \\frac{16}{4 \\cdot 81n^4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

Fifth term: \\( \\frac{32}{5 \\cdot 243n^5} \\), but since we are looking for the coefficient of \\( 1/n^4 \\), we can stop at the fourth term.

So the expansion up to \\( 1/n^4 \\) is:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Therefore, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\).

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations for each term to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First term: \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\), so first term is x = 2/(3n). Correct.

Second term: \\( -x^2/2 = - (4)/(2*(9n^2)) = -4/(18n^2) = -2/(9n^2). Correct.

Third term: \\( x^3/3 = (8)/(3*(27n^3)) = 8/(81n^3). Correct.

Fourth term: \\( -x^4/4 = -16/(4*(81n^4)) = -4/(81n^4). Correct.

So yes, the coefficient for \\( 1/n^4 \\) is indeed -4/81. Therefore, the answer should be \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But wait, the problem states ""the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\)"", so the answer is the numerical coefficient in front of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\), which is -4/81. Let me check if the question is expecting a positive coefficient or something else.

Wait, the original series is \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\). When we converted it to the logarithm, we had \\( S = \\ln(1 + 2/(3n)) \\), which gives the expansion as above. So the coefficient is indeed -4/81. But let me confirm once again.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's try expanding \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) using a binomial expansion for large n. Wait, but since we have \\( 1/n^4 \\), maybe expanding \\( \\frac{1}{3n + 2} \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{3n(1 + 2/(3n))} \\), which would be \\( \\frac{1}{3n} \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n} + \\frac{4}{(3n)^2} - \\frac{8}{(3n)^3} + \\cdots \\right) \\). Then, raising this to the power r would give terms in \\( 1/n^r \\), but since we have a sum over r, perhaps exchanging the sum and the expansion. Hmm, but that might complicate things. Let me see.

Alternatively, since \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1 + 2/(3n))^r} \\). Then, expanding \\( \\frac{1}{(1 + 2/(3n))^r} \\) using the binomial theorem:

\\( \\frac{1}{(1 + 2/(3n))^r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

But then, substituting back into S:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

This seems complicated because it's a double summation. Maybe interchanging the order of summation:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\)

But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions. Wait, but the previous approach using the logarithm seems more straightforward, and I already got an answer. But just to be thorough, let me verify by another method.

Alternatively, recognize that \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n + 2))^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)) \\) as before.

So, expanding \\( \\ln(1 + 2/(3n)) \\), which is the same as \\( \\ln(1 + 2/(3n)) \\), and the expansion is correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\( 1/n^4 \\) is indeed -4/81. Therefore, the answer should be \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\).

But let me check once again. Let's compute the expansion step by step:

\\( \\ln(1 + x) = x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + \\cdots \\)

Here, \\( x = 2/(3n) \\), so:

First term: \\( 2/(3n) \\)

Second term: \\( - (2/(3n))^2 / 2 = -4/(9n^2)/2 = -2/(9n^2) \\)

Third term: \\( (2/(3n))^3 /3 = 8/(27n^3)/3 = 8/(81n^3) \\)

Fourth term: \\( - (2/(3n))^4 /4 = -16/(81n^4)/4 = -4/(81n^4) \\)

Yes, exactly. So the coefficient is -4/81. Therefore, the answer is -4/81.

But just to make sure, let me check if there's an alternative way to compute the coefficient. For example, using the expansion of \\( \\ln(1 + y) \\) where \\( y = 2/(3n) \\), so the expansion is \\( y - y^2/2 + y^3/3 - y^4/4 + \\cdots \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\( y^k \\) is \\( (-1)^{k+1}/k \\). Therefore, for \\( y^4 \\), the coefficient is \\( (-1)^{5}/4 = -1/4 \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\( 1/n^4 \\) is \\( -1/4 \\times (2/(3n))^4 = -1/4 \\times 16/(81n^4) = -4/(81n^4) \\). So that's the same result. Therefore, this confirms the coefficient is -4/81.

Alternatively, if I were to compute the original series directly, expanding each term as a power series in \\( 1/n \\) and then summing over r. Let's see:

Each term in the sum is \\( \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\). Let me write \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1 + 2/(3n))^r} \\). Then, using the binomial expansion:

\\( \\frac{1}{(1 + 2/(3n))^r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

Therefore, the term becomes:

\\( \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

Then, expanding this as a double sum:

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

Interchanging the order of summation:

\\( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\)

Now, the inner sum is:

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\)

Let me denote \\( \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\). Then, the inner sum is:

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\)

Hmm, this seems complex. Let me see if I can find a generating function for the inner sum. Let's consider the sum over r:

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\)

Notice that \\( \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} = \\binom{r + k - 1}{r - 1} \\), which is the number of ways to distribute r indistinct items into k+1 distinct boxes, but maybe that's not helpful here.

Alternatively, recall that \\( \\sum_{r=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} x^r = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} \\). But here, we have an additional factor of \\( \\frac{2^r}{r} \\). So perhaps integrating term by term?

Wait, if I let \\( x = \\frac{2}{(3n)} \\), then:

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{3n} \\right)^r \\)

= \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r \\)

This is similar to \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} x^r \\), which is the generating function for \\( \\frac{1}{1 - x} \\cdot \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^{r - 1}}{r} \\), but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, recall that \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\). But here, we have an extra binomial coefficient. Hmm. Maybe differentiating both sides?

Alternatively, consider that \\( \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} = \\binom{r + k - 1}{r - 1} \\). So, the sum becomes:

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{r - 1} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{3n} \\right)^r \\)

= \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{r - 1} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{3n} \\right)^r \\)

Let me make a substitution m = r - 1, so r = m + 1, when r=1, m=0:

= \\( \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^{m + 1}}{m + 1} \\cdot \\binom{m + k}{m} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{3n} \\right)^{m + 1} \\)

= \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^{m}}{m + 1} \\cdot \\binom{m + k}{m} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{3n} \\right)^{m} \\)

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best. Let's return to the previous method.

Given that the first approach using the logarithm gives a straightforward answer, and cross-checking via the binomial expansion leads to the same result, perhaps I should stick with the logarithm method. Therefore, the coefficient of \\( 1/n^4 \\) is indeed -4/81.

Wait, but let me just compute the expansion once again step by step to make sure:

1. Start with \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\).

2. Recognize that \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\).

3. Let \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), so \\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right) \\).

4. Simplify the argument inside the log: \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\).

5. Therefore, \\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n} \\right) \\).

6. Expand \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) using the Taylor series:

   \\( \\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\), where \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\).

7. Substitute x into the expansion:

   \\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2)^2}{2 \\cdot (3n)^2} + \\frac{(2)^3}{3 \\cdot (3n)^3} - \\frac{(2)^4}{4 \\cdot (3n)^4} + \\cdots \\)

8. Calculate each term:

   - First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)
   - Second term: \\( -\\frac{4}{2 \\cdot 9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)
   - Third term: \\( \\frac{8}{3 \\cdot 27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)
   - Fourth term: \\( -\\frac{16}{4 \\cdot 81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

9. Therefore, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is -4/81.

All steps check out. Therefore, the answer should be \\( \\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}} \\).

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Thus, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, let's see. I need to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\). Hmm, first, I should try to understand what this series looks like. It's an infinite sum where each term has \\( 2^r \\) in the numerator, divided by \\( r \\) and \\( (3n + 2)^r \\). So maybe I can rewrite this series in a different form to make it easier to analyze.

Wait, the general term is \\( \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\). Let me factor out the \\( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\) part. If I let \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), then each term becomes \\( \\frac{x^r}{r} \\). So the series becomes \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} \\). Oh, that's a familiar series! That's the expansion for \\( -\\ln(1 - x) \\), right? Because the Taylor series for \\( \\ln(1 - x) \\) is \\( -\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} \\).

So substituting back, \\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right) \\). Let me check that again. If \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), then \\( 1 - x = 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n + 2 - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\). Therefore, \\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) \\). Simplifying that, \\( S = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) \\), which can be written as \\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\).

So now, the problem reduces to expanding \\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\) as a series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) and finding the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\).

I remember that the Taylor series expansion for \\( \\ln(1 + x) \\) around \\( x = 0 \\) is \\( x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\). So substituting \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\), we get:

\\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/3n)^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/3n)^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/3n)^4}{4} + \\cdots \\).

Simplifying each term:

- First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)
- Second term: \\( -\\frac{(4)}{2(9n^2)} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)
- Third term: \\( \\frac{8}{3(27n^3)} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)
- Fourth term: \\( -\\frac{16}{4(81n^4)} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)
- Fifth term: \\( \\frac{32}{5(243n^5)} = \\frac{32}{1215n^5} \\), and so on.

Therefore, the expansion up to \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is:

\\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\).

So the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with the expansion:

\\( \\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\).

Substituting \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\):

First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)

Second term: \\( - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} = - \\frac{4/(9n^2)}{2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)

Third term: \\( + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} = \\frac{8/(27n^3)}{3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)

Fourth term: \\( - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} = - \\frac{16/(81n^4)}{4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

Yes, that seems right. So the coefficient is indeed \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\).

But let me verify another way. Maybe by expanding the original series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\).

First, note that \\( (3n + 2)^r = (3n)^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r \\). So each term can be written as \\( \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r \\). Therefore, the series becomes:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r \\).

Hmm, but this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps using the expansion for \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) is the correct approach.

Alternatively, maybe we can expand \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) using the binomial theorem for \\( (3n + 2)^r \\), but that might not be straightforward because of the \\( r \\) in the denominator.

Wait, perhaps another approach: express \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) as a power series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\). Let me see.

Alternatively, note that \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\). Then, using the expansion \\( \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\). But this might get messy with the \\( \\frac{1}{r} \\) term.

Alternatively, maybe integrating term-by-term. Wait, but perhaps my initial approach was correct.

Wait, let's verify by computing the expansion of \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) up to \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\).

Alternatively, compute the expansion directly. Let me see:

\\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4 + \\cdots \\)

Calculating each term:

- First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)
- Second term: \\( - \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{9n^2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)
- Third term: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)
- Fourth term: \\( - \\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{16}{81n^4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)
- Fifth term: \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{32}{729n^5} = \\frac{32}{3645n^5} \\), etc.

So yes, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is indeed \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\).

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe by expanding the original series \\( S \\) directly.

The original series is \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\). Let's factor out \\( \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\):

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\).

But expanding \\( \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\) using the binomial theorem:

\\( \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\).

But this would give:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\).

But this seems quite complicated because of the double summation and the binomial coefficients with negative exponents. Perhaps this approach isn't the best. Let me see if I can interchange the sums or find a generating function.

Alternatively, maybe expressing \\( S \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^{r+1}}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\), but that might not help.

Alternatively, note that \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\). Let me set \\( t = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), so \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{t^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - t) \\). Then, \\( t = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), so \\( 1 - t = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\), so \\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\), which is the same as before.

Therefore, the expansion is correct, and the coefficient is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). However, the problem statement mentions that the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Wait, that contradicts my result. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, hold on, the problem says ""Find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\)"" in the series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\), and the user wrote ""the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)"". But according to my calculations, it's \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). So perhaps there is a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me check again.

Starting with the series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\).

Let me substitute \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), so the series becomes \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\).

Therefore, \\( S = -\\ln(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}) \\).

Simplify the argument inside the logarithm:

\\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n + 2 - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\).

Therefore, \\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\).

Expanding \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) as a series:

\\( \\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\), where \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\).

Thus:

\\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\cdots \\).

Calculating each term:

- First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)
- Second term: \\( - \\frac{4}{2(9n^2)} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)
- Third term: \\( \\frac{8}{3(27n^3)} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)
- Fourth term: \\( - \\frac{16}{4(81n^4)} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)
- Fifth term: \\( \\frac{32}{5(243n^5)} = \\frac{32}{1215n^5} \\), etc.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is indeed \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But the user mentioned that the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). There's a discrepancy here. Did I misread the problem?

Wait, the problem says ""Find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\)."" The user also wrote ""the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)"", but according to my calculations, it's \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). So either there's a mistake in my calculation, or perhaps the problem is different.

Wait, maybe I messed up the substitution. Let me check again.

Original series: \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\).

Let me factor out \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\), so \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\left( \\frac{1}{3n + 2} \\right)^r \\).

Let me set \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), so each term becomes \\( \\frac{x^r}{r} \\), so the sum is \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\). Therefore, \\( S = -\\ln(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}) \\).

But \\( 1 - x = 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n + 2 - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\), so \\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\).

Therefore, expanding \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) as a series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But the user says the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Hmm.

Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly? Or perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider expanding \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) first using the binomial theorem and then summing over r.

Let me try that approach. Let's expand \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) as \\( \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\).

Using the binomial expansion for \\( (1 + x)^{-r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} x^k \\), where \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\).

So, \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\).

Therefore, substituting back into S:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\).

But this seems complicated due to the double summation. Let me see if I can interchange the sums:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\).

Simplifying the inner sum:

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r \\binom{-r}{k} \\).

But the term \\( \\binom{-r}{k} \\) is equal to \\( (-1)^k \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\). Therefore:

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r (-1)^k \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\).

This seems quite involved. Maybe this approach is not the best.

Alternatively, maybe integrating term-by-term. Wait, perhaps not. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding \\( S \\) as a power series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\). Let me set \\( y = \\frac{1}{n} \\), so \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3 + 2y)^r} \\).

But expanding \\( \\frac{1}{(3 + 2y)^r} \\) as a series in y. Let's try:

\\( \\frac{1}{(3 + 2y)^r} = \\frac{1}{3^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2y}{3}\\right)^{-r} = \\frac{1}{3^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2y}{3} \\right)^k \\).

Therefore, \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2y}{3} \\right)^k \\).

Simplifying, \\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^k y^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^r \\binom{-r}{k} \\).

Again, similar to the previous approach, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a generating function relationship here.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the expansion of \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) as a Laurent series in n. Let me see.

But my initial approach gave \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\), but the user says the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). There must be a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the expansion of \\( \\ln(1 + x) \\). Let me confirm the expansion.

The Taylor series for \\( \\ln(1 + x) \\) around x=0 is \\( x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\). Yes, that's correct.

Substituting \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\):

First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)

Second term: \\( - \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2 = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)

Third term: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)

Fourth term: \\( - \\frac{1}{4} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4 = - \\frac{16}{4(81n^4)} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

Yes, so the coefficient is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). So unless there's a miscalculation here, this should be correct.

But the user says the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Maybe the problem was different? For example, if the coefficient was for \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), it would be \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). But the problem specifically asks for \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\).

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Or perhaps I made a mistake in substituting variables.

Wait, let me check once more:

Original series: \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\).

Let me compute the first few terms manually to see if they match the expansion.

For example, let's compute S up to r=4 and see.

For r=1: \\( \\frac{2}{1(3n + 2)^1} = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\).

For r=2: \\( \\frac{4}{2(3n + 2)^2} = \\frac{2}{(3n + 2)^2} \\).

For r=3: \\( \\frac{8}{3(3n + 2)^3} \\).

For r=4: \\( \\frac{16}{4(3n + 2)^4} = \\frac{4}{(3n + 2)^4} \\).

So S = \\( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} + \\frac{2}{(3n + 2)^2} + \\frac{8}{3(3n + 2)^3} + \\frac{4}{(3n + 2)^4} + \\cdots \\).

But expanding this as a series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), we need to expand each term using binomial expansion.

Let's take the first term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{2}{3n(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})} = \\frac{2}{3n} \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n} + \\frac{4}{(3n)^2} - \\frac{8}{(3n)^3} + \\cdots \\right) \\).

Similarly, the second term: \\( \\frac{2}{(3n + 2)^2} = \\frac{2}{(3n)^2(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})^2} = \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{3n} + \\frac{12}{(3n)^2} - \\cdots \\right) \\).

Third term: \\( \\frac{8}{3(3n + 2)^3} = \\frac{8}{3(3n)^3} \\left(1 - \\frac{6}{3n} + \\frac{24}{(3n)^2} - \\cdots \\right) \\).

Fourth term: \\( \\frac{4}{(3n + 2)^4} = \\frac{4}{(3n)^4} \\left(1 - \\frac{8}{3n} + \\frac{56}{(3n)^2} - \\cdots \\right) \\).

Now, let's collect terms up to \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\):

First term:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{4}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{27n^3} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Second term:

\\( \\frac{2}{9n^2} - \\frac{8}{27n^3} + \\frac{48}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Third term:

\\( \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Fourth term:

\\( \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Adding up all these terms:

- For \\( n^{-1} \\): \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)
- For \\( n^{-2} \\): \\( -\\frac{4}{9n^2} + \\frac{2}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)
- For \\( n^{-3} \\): \\( \\frac{8}{27n^3} - \\frac{8}{27n^3} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)
- For \\( n^{-4} \\): \\( -\\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\frac{48}{81n^4} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\frac{4}{81n^4} = (-16 + 48 -16 +4)/81n^4 = 20/81n^4 \\)

Wait, that gives the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) as \\( \\frac{20}{81} \\). But this contradicts both previous results. Hmm, clearly, this approach is leading to confusion.

Wait, this discrepancy suggests that there's a mistake in either the expansion method or the term-by-term addition. Let me check the expansion of each term again.

First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\)

Expressed as \\( \\frac{2}{3n(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})} = \\frac{2}{3n} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\).

So:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n} + \\frac{4}{9n^2} - \\frac{8}{27n^3} + \\frac{16}{81n^4} - \\cdots \\right) \\).

Therefore, expanding:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{4}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{27n^3} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\).

Second term: \\( \\frac{2}{(3n + 2)^2} \\)

Expressed as \\( \\frac{2}{(3n)^2(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})^2} = \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{k + 1}{1} (-1)^k \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\).

Wait, the expansion of \\( (1 + x)^{-2} \\) is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k (k + 1) x^k \\).

So:

\\( \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k (k + 1) \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\).

Therefore, expanding:

\\( \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\left(1 - 2\\frac{2}{3n} + 3\\frac{4}{9n^2} - 4\\frac{8}{27n^3} + 5\\frac{16}{81n^4} - \\cdots \\right) \\).

Simplifying:

\\( \\frac{2}{9n^2} - \\frac{8}{27n^3} + \\frac{24}{81n^4} - \\frac{64}{243n^5} + \\cdots \\).

Third term: \\( \\frac{8}{3(3n + 2)^3} \\)

Expressed as \\( \\frac{8}{3(3n)^3(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{k + 2}{2} (-1)^k \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\).

The expansion for \\( (1 + x)^{-3} \\) is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\binom{k + 2}{2} x^k \\).

Therefore:

\\( \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\left(1 - 3\\frac{2}{3n} + 6\\frac{4}{9n^2} - 10\\frac{8}{27n^3} + 15\\frac{16}{81n^4} - \\cdots \\right) \\).

Simplifying:

\\( \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{48}{243n^4} + \\frac{384}{2187n^5} - \\cdots \\).

Fourth term: \\( \\frac{4}{(3n + 2)^4} \\)

Expressed as \\( \\frac{4}{(3n)^4(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})^4} = \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{k + 3}{3} (-1)^k \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\).

The expansion for \\( (1 + x)^{-4} \\) is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\binom{k + 3}{3} x^k \\).

Therefore:

\\( \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\left(1 - 4\\frac{2}{3n} + 10\\frac{4}{9n^2} - 20\\frac{8}{27n^3} + 35\\frac{16}{81n^4} - \\cdots \\right) \\).

Simplifying:

\\( \\frac{4}{81n^4} - \\frac{128}{2187n^5} + \\cdots \\).

Now, let's collect all terms up to \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\):

From first term:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{4}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{27n^3} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} \\)

From second term:

\\( \\frac{2}{9n^2} - \\frac{8}{27n^3} + \\frac{24}{81n^4} \\)

From third term:

\\( \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{48}{243n^4} \\)

From fourth term:

\\( \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

Adding them up:

- \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\): \\( -\\frac{16}{81} + \\frac{24}{81} - \\frac{48}{243} + \\frac{4}{81} \\)

Convert all to denominator 243:

- \\( -\\frac{16}{81} = -\\frac{48}{243} \\)
- \\( \\frac{24}{81} = \\frac{72}{243} \\)
- \\( -\\frac{48}{243} \\)
- \\( \\frac{4}{81} = \\frac{12}{243} \\)

Adding: \\( -48 + 72 -48 +12 = (-48 +72) + (-48 +12) = 24 -36 = -12 \\)

Therefore, \\( \\frac{-12}{243} = \\frac{-4}{81} \\).

So the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\), which matches my previous result. However, the user mentioned that the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). There's clearly a discrepancy here. This suggests that either the user provided an incorrect answer, or there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Wait, perhaps the problem was to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), which would be \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). But as per the problem statement, it's \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\). Alternatively, maybe the problem was to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the expansion of \\( S \\) around \\( n = 0 \\), but the expansion we did was around \\( \\infty \\), since \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) is small.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the way the series is written. Let me check the original problem again.

The problem says: ""Find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\).""

Given that, according to my calculations, the coefficient is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But the user provided ""the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)"", which is conflicting. Therefore, I need to confirm my calculations once again.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the expansion of \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\).

Wait, let's compute the expansion up to \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) again:

\\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} \\)

Calculate each term:

- \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)
- \\( - \\frac{4}{2(9n^2)} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)
- \\( \\frac{8}{3(27n^3)} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)
- \\( - \\frac{16}{4(81n^4)} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

Yes, so the coefficient is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\).

Therefore, unless there's a mistake in the problem statement or the provided answer is incorrect, the correct coefficient should be \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\).

But maybe the problem was to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the expansion of \\( S \\) around \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n = 0 \\) makes the denominator \\( 3n + 2 = 2 \\), and the series becomes \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(2)^r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\), which diverges. Therefore, the expansion is valid for \\( |n| > 2/3 \\), but Laurent series around \\( n = 0 \\) isn't appropriate here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to expand \\( S \\) as a Laurent series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), which is what I did. In that case, the coefficient is indeed \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\).

Therefore, the user's provided answer of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) must be incorrect. Alternatively, there could be a misinterpretation of the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the expansion of \\( S \\) around \\( n = \\infty \\), which is the standard approach for such series. In this case, the expansion \\( S = \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) is valid for large \\( n \\), and the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\).

Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation I haven't detected, the correct answer should be \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). However, since the user insists the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), there might be a different approach expected here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was to compute the expansion of \\( S \\) as a power series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) but starting from \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), and the user made a mistake in stating the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the original series was different. For example, if the series was \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2)^r}{r(3n)^r} \\), then \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n))^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - 2/(3n)) = \\ln(1/(1 - 2/(3n))) \\), but this is a different series.

Alternatively, maybe the problem had a typo, and the coefficient is for \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), which is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\).

Given the conflicting information, but based on the detailed calculations, I believe the correct coefficient for \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). Therefore, there might be an error in the user's provided answer.

**Final Answer**
The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Thus, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the series given is an infinite sum where each term is \\(\\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). The variable here is \\(n\\), and the coefficient they're asking for is the one multiplied by \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\). So essentially, I need to expand this series as a Laurent series (since it might have negative powers of \\(n\\)) and find the coefficient of \\(n^{-4}\\).

Wait, the problem says \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). Let me write that out more clearly:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\)

First, maybe I can rewrite this series in a more familiar form. Let's see. The general term is \\(\\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let me factor out the constants:

\\( \\frac{2^r}{(3n + 2)^r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{r} = \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r \\)

So the series becomes:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r \\)

Hmm, this looks similar to the Taylor series expansion of the natural logarithm. Wait, the standard expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\) is \\( \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^r}{r} \\). So if I can express the given series in terms of a logarithm, maybe that would help.

Let me set \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\). Then the series becomes:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\)

Therefore, substituting back for \\( x \\):

\\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right) \\)

Simplify the argument inside the logarithm:

\\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{(3n + 2) - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\)

So,

\\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = -\\ln(3n) + \\ln(3n + 2) \\)

Alternatively, using logarithm properties:

\\( S = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\)

Ah, so \\( S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\). That's a simpler expression. Now, I need to expand this logarithm into a series and find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\).

Recall that the Taylor series expansion for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\) around \\(x = 0\\) is:

\\( \\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\)

So substituting \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\), we get:

\\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\cdots \\)

Let me compute each term up to \\(1/n^4\\):

First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)

Second term: \\( - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} = - \\frac{4}{9n^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)

Third term: \\( \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} = \\frac{8}{27n^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)

Fourth term: \\( - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} = - \\frac{16}{81n^4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

So combining these terms:

\\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Therefore, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But wait, the problem statement says the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). That contradicts my result. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let me check my steps again. Starting from the beginning:

The original series is \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\). I rewrote this as \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r \\). Then recognized that this is the expansion of \\( -\\ln(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}) \\). Simplifying the argument inside the log gave \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\). Then expanding that logarithm gives the series with coefficients I found.

But according to my calculation, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-4/81\\), but the problem says the answer is \\(2/3\\). There's a discrepancy here. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I messed up the logarithm expansion. Let me verify the steps:

Starting from \\( S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\). The expansion of \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\) is \\( x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + \\cdots \\). So substituting \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\):

First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)

Second term: \\( - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} = - \\frac{4}{9n^2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)

Third term: \\( \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} = \\frac{8}{27n^3} \\times \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)

Fourth term: \\( - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} = - \\frac{16}{81n^4} \\times \\frac{1}{4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

So yes, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-4/81\\). But the problem says the answer is \\(2/3\\). That suggests I might have a mistake in my approach.

Wait, let's check the original problem again. The user wrote: ""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)"".

Wait, maybe the user included a typo here? Because if they mention the answer is \\(2/3\\), but according to my steps, it's \\(-4/81\\). Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Wait, the user wrote:

""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)""

But this seems like the user might have included the answer in the problem statement. Wait, maybe the problem is written as:

""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)""

But that is confusing. Maybe the user intended to write ""the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)"", but that's not clear. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to expand the original series directly without converting it into a logarithm. Let me try that approach.

Original series: \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\)

Let me write \\( (3n + 2)^r \\) as \\( (3n + 2)^r = 3^r n^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r \\). Wait, but expanding this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out 3n from the denominator:

\\( (3n + 2)^r = 3^r \\left(n + \\frac{2}{3}\\right)^r \\)

But maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, let's write \\( (3n + 2)^r = (3n)^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r \\). Then,

\\( \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{2^r}{r \\cdot 3^r n^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Hmm, so:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, maybe use a substitution. Let me set \\( x = \\frac{1}{n} \\). Then, the series becomes:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3 + 2x)^r} \\)

But this might not help directly. Alternatively, expand \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) using binomial expansion.

Wait, \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

So,

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r (3n)^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Let me denote \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\), then:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n))^r}{r} \\left(1 + x\\right)^{-r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(x)^r}{r} (1 + x)^{-r} \\)

Hmm, but this seems like a hypergeometric series or something. Alternatively, perhaps this is a generating function.

Alternatively, note that \\( (1 + x)^{-r} \\) can be expressed as a binomial series:

\\( (1 + x)^{-r} = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{-r}{k} x^k \\)

But this might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps I can write:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Let me combine the terms:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{2}{3n}} \\right)^r = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r \\)

Wait, but this is the same as the original series. So that approach didn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I need to expand \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{3n} \\). Let me write \\( (3n + 2)^r = 3^r n^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r \\), so:

\\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Therefore, the original series becomes:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Simplify:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Let me denote \\( y = \\frac{2}{3n} \\). Then:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} y^r (1 + y)^{-r} \\)

Hmm, this is a series in \\( y \\), but \\( y \\) itself is \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\). Maybe I can express this as a generating function.

Alternatively, note that \\( y(1 + y) = \\frac{2}{3n}(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\), but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps expand \\( (1 + y)^{-r} \\) using the binomial theorem for negative exponents:

\\( (1 + y)^{-r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-y)^k \\)

So,

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} y^r \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-y)^k \\)

Interchange the sums:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} y^{r + k} \\)

Let me set \\( m = r + k \\), then \\( r = m - k \\), so when \\( r \\geq 1 \\), \\( m \\geq k + 1 \\). Therefore:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k \\sum_{m=k+1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m - k} \\binom{m - 1}{k} y^m \\)

This seems very complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best. Let me think again.

Earlier, I converted the series into a logarithm and expanded it, getting the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) as \\(-4/81\\), but the problem states the answer is \\(2/3\\). There's a conflict here. Did I make a mistake in the logarithm expansion?

Wait, let me check again the expansion of \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\). The standard expansion is \\(x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + \\dots\\), which is correct. So substituting \\(x = 2/(3n)\\), the expansion should be:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\dots \\)

Calculating each term:

1. \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)
2. \\( - \\frac{4}{9n^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)
3. \\( + \\frac{8}{27n^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = + \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)
4. \\( - \\frac{16}{81n^4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

So the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is indeed \\(-4/81\\). But the problem says the answer is \\(2/3\\). That's a big difference. Maybe I misread the problem?

Wait, the problem says ""the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\)"", but perhaps there's a miscalculation here. Alternatively, maybe the original series wasn't converted correctly into a logarithm.

Wait, let me verify the initial step where I converted the series into a logarithm. The original series is \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\). Let me factor out the constants:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r \\)

Then, recognizing that \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\), so substituting \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\):

\\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right) \\)

Simplify the argument:

\\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n + 2 - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\)

Therefore,

\\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = -\\left[ \\ln(3n) - \\ln(3n + 2) \\right] = \\ln(3n + 2) - \\ln(3n) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\)

So that's correct. Then expanding \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) gives the series up to \\(1/n^4\\) as \\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\dots \\). So the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is indeed \\(-4/81\\).

But the problem states the answer is \\(2/3\\). This suggests either a mistake in my calculation or a misunderstanding of the problem. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I should have expanded \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) differently. Let's try expanding \\( \\ln(1 + x) \\) where \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\), but perhaps express it as a Laurent series in \\( n \\). Let's see:

\\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln(3n + 2) - \\ln(3n) \\)

Alternatively, expand \\( \\ln(3n + 2) \\) as \\( \\ln(3n(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})) = \\ln(3n) + \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\), so:

\\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) = \\ln(3n + 2) - \\ln(3n) \\)

But this doesn't help. Alternatively, perhaps expanding \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) as a series in \\(1/n\\):

Let me set \\( x = \\frac{1}{n} \\), so the expression becomes \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3}x) \\). Expanding this in powers of \\( x \\):

\\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3}x) = \\frac{2}{3}x - \\frac{(2/3)^2}{2}x^2 + \\frac{(2/3)^3}{3}x^3 - \\frac{(2/3)^4}{4}x^4 + \\dots \\)

Substituting back \\( x = \\frac{1}{n} \\):

\\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\dots \\)

Same as before. So the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-4/81\\), which is approximately \\(-0.0494\\). But the problem mentions the answer is \\(2/3\\), which is about \\(0.6667\\). These are vastly different. There must be a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in converting the original series into a logarithm. Let me verify again:

Original series: \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\)

Let me consider \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r \\)

Let \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), then the series is \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\). Therefore, \\( S = -\\ln(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}) \\). Simplify:

\\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\), so \\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\). Correct.

Then expanding \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) gives the series as above. So unless there's an error in the problem statement, my answer is \\(-4/81\\). But the user mentions the answer is \\(2/3\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem was to find the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) instead of \\(1/n^4\\), but that's unlikely.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial step. Let's check with another approach.

Alternative approach: Express the original series as a power series in \\(1/n\\).

Given \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\)

Let me write \\( (3n + 2)^r = (3n)^r (1 + \\frac{2}{3n})^r \\), so:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r (3n)^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Let me denote \\( x = \\frac{1}{n} \\), then:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^r x^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3}x \\right)^{-r} \\)

So,

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3}x \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{2}{3}x} \\right)^r = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}x}{1 + \\frac{2}{3}x} \\right)^r \\)

Let me set \\( y = \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}x}{1 + \\frac{2}{3}x} \\). Then,

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{y^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - y) \\)

Substituting back \\( y \\):

\\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{\\frac{2}{3}x}{1 + \\frac{2}{3}x}\\right) = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{1 + \\frac{2}{3}x - \\frac{2}{3}x}{1 + \\frac{2}{3}x} \\right) = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{2}{3}x} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3}x\\right) \\)

Which is the same as before. So again, \\( S = \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3}x) \\), where \\( x = \\frac{1}{n} \\). Therefore, expanding this gives the same coefficients as before. So the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-4/81\\).

But the problem says the answer is \\(2/3\\). This is confusing. Maybe the user made a typo, or perhaps I miscalculated.

Wait, let's compute \\(-4/81\\). If I convert this to a fraction, it's \\(-4/81\\). But maybe the problem is asking for the absolute value or something. But no, the coefficient is negative.

Alternatively, maybe I should have expanded the original series using a different method. Let's try expanding \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) directly using the binomial theorem.

Wait, \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Expanding \\( \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\) using the binomial series for negative exponents:

\\( \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

But this seems complicated. However, maybe we can interchange the sums:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

Interchanging the sums:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

Simplify:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\)

This seems very involved. Let me compute the inner sum for each \\(k\\).

For \\(k=0\\):

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{0} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\cdot 1 = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n} \\right) \\)

For \\(k=1\\):

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{1} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} (-r) = - \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{(3n)^r} = - \\frac{\\frac{2}{3n}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3n}} = - \\frac{2}{3n - 2} \\)

Similarly, for \\(k=2\\):

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{2} \\)

This is getting too complicated. Maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding the original series as a Laurent series around \\(n = \\infty\\). Since we are looking for the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\), we can expand each term in the series as a Laurent series in \\(1/n\\) and then collect the coefficients.

Given \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\)

Let me write \\( (3n + 2)^r = 3^r n^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r \\), so:

\\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Therefore,

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Let me denote \\( x = \\frac{1}{n} \\), so:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^r x^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3}x \\right)^{-r} \\)

Now, extend this as a power series in \\(x\\):

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^r x^r \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3}x \\right)^k \\)

Interchanging the sums:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^r x^{r + k} \\)

Let me change variables: let \\( m = r + k \\), so \\( r = m - k \\). Then:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^k \\sum_{m=k+1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m - k} \\binom{-(m - k)}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^{m - k} x^m \\)

This is extremely complicated. It seems that expanding this way is not practical. Perhaps the initial approach using the logarithm is the correct path, even though it leads to a different answer than what the problem suggests.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) instead of \\(1/n^4\\). If that were the case, then we would need to look for terms involving \\(n^4\\), but given the original series has terms like \\(1/(3n + 2)^r\\), which for large \\(n\\) behaves like \\(1/(3n)^r\\), so the series decays as \\(1/n^r\\), which for \\(r=1\\) is \\(1/n\\), \\(r=2\\) is \\(1/n^2\\), etc. Therefore, the series only contains negative powers of \\(n\\), so there are no positive powers of \\(n\\), including \\(n^4\\). Hence, the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) would be zero. But the problem mentions \\(1/n^4\\), so that is plausible.

Given that, and my calculation giving \\(-4/81\\), but the problem stating \\(2/3\\), I need to reconcile this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial logarithm conversion. Let me check the identity again.

Given \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\), and the identity \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\). Therefore, substituting \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\):

\\( S = -\\ln(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}) \\)

Simplify inside the log:

\\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n + 2 - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\)

Thus,

\\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = -\\ln(3n) + \\ln(3n + 2) \\)

But \\( \\ln(3n + 2) = \\ln(3n(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})) = \\ln(3n) + \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\), so:

\\( S = -\\ln(3n) + \\ln(3n) + \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) = \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\)

Therefore, this is correct. So the expansion is indeed \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\), which expands to the series I computed earlier.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is in the original series. Maybe the series is supposed to be \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\), but the user made a typo and it should be \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(3n)^r}{r(2)^r} \\), but that's speculation.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider expanding the original series in terms of \\(1/n\\) using a different method.

Let me try expanding \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) as a power series in \\(1/n\\):

\\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

Therefore, the original series becomes:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

Interchanging the sums:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

Simplify:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\)

This is the same expression as before. Let's compute the inner sum for each \\(k\\):

For \\(k=0\\):

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{0} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n} \\right) \\)

For \\(k=1\\):

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{1} = - \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} r = - \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{(3n)^r} = - \\frac{\\frac{2}{3n}}{1 - \\frac{2}{3n}} = - \\frac{2}{3n - 2} \\)

For \\(k=2\\):

\\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{2} \\)

This is getting too complicated. Maybe this approach is not helpful.

Given that, perhaps my initial approach is the correct one, leading to the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) being \\(-4/81\\). But since the problem states the answer is \\(2/3\\), there must be a mistake somewhere.

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) in the expansion of \\(S\\), but \\(S\\) only has negative powers of \\(n\\). Alternatively, perhaps there is a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe the original series is written incorrectly. If the series were \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(3n)^r}{r(2)^r} \\), then it would be a different problem. But as given, the series is \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\).

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^{r}} \\), but with a different exponent, such as \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^{r}} \\) but with \\(n\\) in the numerator. But that's just speculation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the sign when converting the logarithm. Let me check again:

\\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right) \\)

But \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\), so:

\\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\)

Yes, that's correct. Then expanding \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) gives the series as calculated.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(n^{-4}\\), which is \\( -4/81 \\), but the user wrote \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should compute the expansion up to \\(1/n^4\\) using a different method.

Let me try expanding \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) as a power series in \\(1/n\\) directly.

\\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\)

Expand \\( \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} \\) using the binomial series:

\\( \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{ -r }{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

Therefore,

\\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{ -r }{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{ -r }{k} \\frac{2^k}{3^{k + r} n^{k + r}} \\)

Substitute this into the original series:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{ -r }{k} \\frac{2^k}{3^{k + r} n^{k + r}} \\)

Interchange the sums:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\binom{ -r }{k} \\frac{2^k}{3^{k + r} n^{k + r}} \\)

Simplify:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^k}{3^k} \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\binom{ -r }{k} \\frac{1}{3^r n^{k + r}} \\)

Let me denote \\( m = k + r \\), so \\( r = m - k \\). Then:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^k}{3^k} \\sum_{m=k+1}^\\infty \\frac{2^{m - k}}{m - k} \\binom{ -(m - k) }{k} \\frac{1}{3^{m - k} n^m} \\)

This is very complicated. However, perhaps for each \\(m\\), the coefficient can be computed by summing over \\(k\\) from 0 to \\(m - 1\\):

\\( S = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{n^m} \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\frac{2^k}{3^k} \\cdot \\frac{2^{m - k}}{m - k} \\binom{ -(m - k) }{k} \\frac{1}{3^{m - k}} \\)

Simplify the expression inside the summation:

\\( \\frac{2^k}{3^k} \\cdot \\frac{2^{m - k}}{m - k} \\binom{ -(m - k) }{k} \\frac{1}{3^{m - k}} = \\frac{2^m}{m - k} \\binom{ -(m - k) }{k} \\frac{1}{3^m} \\)

Therefore,

\\( S = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^m}{3^m n^m} \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\frac{1}{m - k} \\binom{ -(m - k) }{k} \\)

This is still complicated, but perhaps for \\(m = 4\\), we can compute the coefficient.

For \\(m = 4\\), the coefficient is:

\\( \\frac{2^4}{3^4} \\sum_{k=0}^{3} \\frac{1}{4 - k} \\binom{ -(4 - k) }{k} \\)

Compute each term for \\(k = 0, 1, 2, 3\\):

For \\(k = 0\\):

\\( \\frac{1}{4} \\binom{ -4 }{0} = \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{1}{4} \\)

For \\(k = 1\\):

\\( \\frac{1}{3} \\binom{ -3 }{1} = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot (-3) = -1 \\)

For \\(k = 2\\):

\\( \\frac{1}{2} \\binom{ -2 }{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{(-2)(-3)}{2} = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 = \\frac{3}{2} \\)

For \\(k = 3\\):

\\( \\frac{1}{1} \\binom{ -1 }{3} = \\frac{1}{1} \\cdot \\frac{(-1)(-2)(-3)}{6} = \\frac{1}{1} \\cdot (-1) = -1 \\)

Summing these up:

\\( \\frac{1}{4} -1 + \\frac{3}{2} -1 = \\frac{1}{4} -1 + 1.5 -1 = \\frac{1}{4} - 0.5 = -\\frac{1}{4} \\)

Therefore, the coefficient for \\(m = 4\\) is:

\\( \\frac{16}{81} \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{4}) = -\\frac{4}{81} \\)

Which matches my previous result. So the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is indeed \\(-4/81\\).

Given that, I must conclude that either the problem statement is incorrect, or there is a misunderstanding. The answer should be \\(-4/81\\), but the problem mentions \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Maybe the user intended to ask for the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) in a different expansion, or there was a typo in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps I missed a negative sign somewhere. Let me check the logarithm expansion again.

The expansion of \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\) is \\(x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + \\cdots\\), so substituting \\(x = 2/(3n)\\):

\\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\cdots \\)

Calculating each term:

1. \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)
2. \\( - \\frac{4}{9n^2} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)
3. \\( \\frac{8}{27n^3} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)
4. \\( - \\frac{16}{81n^4} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

Yes, the fourth term is \\(-4/81n^4\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(-4/81\\).

Given this thorough process, I can only conclude that the correct coefficient is \\(-4/81\\), and there might be an error in the problem statement or the provided answer. However, based on the calculations and multiple approaches confirming the same result, I believe the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-4/81\\).

**Final Answer**
The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series is \\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}.

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Thus, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

","Okay, let me try to figure out how to find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). Hmm, first, I need to understand the structure of this series. It looks like a summation involving \\(r\\) from 1 to infinity, with terms that have \\(2^r\\) in the numerator and \\(r(3n + 2)^r\\) in the denominator. 

Maybe I can rewrite the general term of the series to simplify it. Let's see. The term inside the summation is \\(\\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). If I factor out \\(\\frac{1}{3n + 2}\\), I get \\(\\frac{1}{3n + 2} \\cdot \\frac{2^r}{(3n + 2)^{r - 1}}\\). Wait, but that might not be the most helpful way. Alternatively, perhaps I can factor out \\(\\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r}\\) and write the term as \\(\\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r}\\). 

Hold on, the sum is over \\(r\\), so maybe if I can express \\(r\\) as an exponent, I can relate this to a known series expansion. Let me recall that the Taylor series expansion of \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\) is \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r}\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\). Comparing this to the given series, perhaps there's a connection. If I set \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\), then the summation becomes \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\), which is exactly the form of the \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\) series. 

Therefore, the series \\(S\\) can be expressed as \\(S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). Let me check that substitution again. If \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\), then \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x)\\). So yes, substituting back, \\(S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). 

Now, simplifying the argument inside the logarithm. Let's compute \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\). That would be \\(\\frac{(3n + 2) - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\). Therefore, \\(S = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). Simplifying further, that's the same as \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n + 2}{3n}\\right)\\) because \\(-\\ln(a/b) = \\ln(b/a)\\). So \\(S = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3n + 2}{3n}\\right)\\). 

Alternatively, we can write this as \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). That might be a more useful form for expanding in a series. Because \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\) has a known Taylor expansion around \\(x = 0\\), which is \\(x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\). In our case, \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\), so we can expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) as a series in powers of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\).

Let's write that out:

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 + \\cdots
\\]

Simplifying each term:

First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)

Second term: \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)

Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

And so on. Therefore, the expansion up to the \\(1/n^4\\) term is:

\\[
\\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots
\\]

But the problem asks for the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\). Looking at the expansion, the coefficient is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). Wait, but let me verify the calculations step by step to make sure I didn't make any errors.

Starting with the logarithm expansion:

\\[
\\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Substituting \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\):

First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)

Second term: \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)

Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 = -\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

Yes, that seems correct. So the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is indeed \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). But wait, the problem states that the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which contradicts this result. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake in the steps.

Let me retrace my steps. Starting from the original series:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\)

I recognized the sum as \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\) where \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\). Then, \\(S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\), so \\(S = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3n + 2}{3n}\\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). That seems right.

Expanding \\(\\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})\\) into the Taylor series gives the terms I calculated. But according to my calculation, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). However, the user mentioned that the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which is a positive number. Maybe there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, perhaps the original problem is different. Let me check again. The user wrote: ""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). The answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)."" But according to my calculation, it's \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). That's a significant discrepancy. Maybe I made an error in the steps.

Wait, let's check the substitution again. The sum is \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let me factor out \\(\\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r}\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r
\\]

Which is exactly the form of the \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\) series where \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\). Therefore, \\(S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). So that's correct.

Then simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\). Therefore, \\(S = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3n + 2}{3n}\\right)\\). That step is also correct.

Then, writing \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n + 2}{3n}\\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). Correct.

Expanding \\(\\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})\\) using the Taylor series:

\\[
\\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term:

First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)

Second term: \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)

Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

So, up to the \\(1/n^4\\) term, the coefficient is indeed \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). But the user claims the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). That's a contradiction. Maybe the problem was stated incorrectly, or perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The user wrote: ""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). The answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)."" Wait, but according to my calculations, it's \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). Maybe the user made a mistake, or maybe I'm missing something.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) in the expansion of \\(S\\) around \\(n = \\infty\\), but in that case, the expansion I did is correct. Hmm. Let me check if there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, maybe expanding \\(1/(3n + 2)^r\\) as a binomial expansion for large \\(n\\), and then summing over \\(r\\). Let's try that.

First, note that \\(3n + 2 = 3n(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})\\), so \\(\\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})^r}\\). Then, using the binomial expansion for \\(\\frac{1}{(1 + x)^r}\\) where \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\):

\\[
\\frac{1}{(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})^r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k
\\]

But since we're interested in the expansion up to \\(1/n^4\\), we can truncate the series at \\(k = 4\\). However, this might complicate things because we have to sum over both \\(r\\) and \\(k\\). Let's see.

Substituting back into the original sum:

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k
\\]

But this seems more complicated. Let's try to interchange the sums:

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r (3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k
\\]

= \\(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r (3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k\\)

= \\(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r (3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\frac{2^k}{(3n)^k}\\)

= \\(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^k}{(3n)^k} \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r (3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k}\\)

But this seems complicated. Let's compute each coefficient for \\(n^4\\). Let me see. To find the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\), we need to look for terms where the total power of \\(1/n\\) is 4. Each term in the double sum has a power of \\(1/n^{k + r}\\). Therefore, \\(k + r = 4\\). So, possible values of \\(k\\) and \\(r\\) such that \\(k + r = 4\\) and \\(r \\geq 1\\), \\(k \\geq 0\\). Therefore:

For \\(r = 1\\), \\(k = 3\\)

For \\(r = 2\\), \\(k = 2\\)

For \\(r = 3\\), \\(k = 1\\)

For \\(r = 4\\), \\(k = 0\\)

So, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is the sum over these terms.

Let's compute each term:

1. For \\(r = 1\\), \\(k = 3\\):

Term: \\(\\frac{2^1}{1 (3n)^1} \\binom{-1}{3} \\frac{2^3}{(3n)^3}\\)

Compute \\(\\binom{-1}{3}\\):

Using the generalized binomial coefficient: \\(\\binom{-1}{k} = (-1)^k \\binom{k + 0}{k} = (-1)^k\\). Wait, no, actually, \\(\\binom{-1}{k} = (-1)^k \\binom{k + 0}{k} = (-1)^k\\). Wait, let's verify:

\\[
\\binom{-1}{k} = \\frac{(-1)(-2)(-3)\\cdots(-1 - k + 1)}{k!} = (-1)^k \\frac{(1)(2)(3)\\cdots k}{k!} = (-1)^k
\\]

Therefore, \\(\\binom{-1}{3} = (-1)^3 = -1\\)

So the term becomes:

\\(\\frac{2}{3n} \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{2}{3n} \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\frac{8}{27n^3} = -\\frac{16}{81n^4}\\)

2. For \\(r = 2\\), \\(k = 2\\):

Term: \\(\\frac{2^2}{2 (3n)^2} \\binom{-2}{2} \\frac{2^2}{(3n)^2}\\)

Compute \\(\\binom{-2}{2}\\):

\\[
\\binom{-2}{2} = \\frac{(-2)(-3)}{2!} = \\frac{6}{2} = 3
\\]

But wait, the generalized binomial coefficient formula is:

\\[
\\binom{-m}{k} = (-1)^k \\binom{m + k - 1}{k}
\\]

So for \\(m = 2\\), \\(k = 2\\):

\\[
\\binom{-2}{2} = (-1)^2 \\binom{2 + 2 - 1}{2} = 1 \\cdot \\binom{3}{2} = 3
\\]

Therefore, the term becomes:

\\(\\frac{4}{9n^2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9n^2} = \\frac{4}{9n^2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9n^2} = \\frac{48}{81n^4} = \\frac{16}{27n^4}\\)

3. For \\(r = 3\\), \\(k = 1\\):

Term: \\(\\frac{2^3}{3 (3n)^3} \\binom{-3}{1} \\frac{2^1}{(3n)^1}\\)

Compute \\(\\binom{-3}{1}\\):

Using the formula:

\\[
\\binom{-3}{1} = (-1)^1 \\binom{3 + 1 - 1}{1} = -1 \\cdot \\binom{3}{1} = -3
\\]

So the term becomes:

\\(\\frac{8}{81n^3} \\cdot (-3) \\cdot \\frac{2}{3n} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\cdot (-6) \\cdot \\frac{1}{n} = -\\frac{48}{81n^4} = -\\frac{16}{27n^4}\\)

4. For \\(r = 4\\), \\(k = 0\\):

Term: \\(\\frac{2^4}{4 (3n)^4} \\binom{-4}{0} \\frac{2^0}{(3n)^0}\\)

Compute \\(\\binom{-4}{0}\\):

Any binomial coefficient with \\(k = 0\\) is 1, regardless of the upper parameter. So \\(\\binom{-4}{0} = 1\\). Therefore:

The term becomes:

\\(\\frac{16}{81n^4} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{16}{81n^4}\\)

Now, summing all these terms:

- From \\(r=1\\): \\(-\\frac{16}{81n^4}\\)

- From \\(r=2\\): \\(\\frac{16}{27n^4}\\)

- From \\(r=3\\): \\(-\\frac{16}{27n^4}\\)

- From \\(r=4\\): \\(\\frac{16}{81n^4}\\)

Adding them together:

\\(-\\frac{16}{81} + \\frac{16}{27} - \\frac{16}{27} + \\frac{16}{81}\\)

Simplify term by term:

- \\(-\\frac{16}{81} + \\frac{16}{81} = 0\\)

- \\(\\frac{16}{27} - \\frac{16}{27} = 0\\)

Wait, that can't be right. All terms cancel out? That would mean the coefficient is zero, which contradicts the previous result. But how?

Wait, this is confusing. Let me recheck the calculations.

For \\(r=1, k=3\\):

Term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n} \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\frac{8}{27n^3} = -\\frac{16}{81n^4}\\) âï¸

For \\(r=2, k=2\\):

Term: \\(\\frac{4}{9n^2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9n^2} = \\frac{48}{81n^4} = \\frac{16}{27n^4}\\) âï¸

For \\(r=3, k=1\\):

Term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3} \\cdot (-3) \\cdot \\frac{2}{3n} = -\\frac{48}{81n^4} = -\\frac{16}{27n^4}\\) âï¸

For \\(r=4, k=0\\):

Term: \\(\\frac{16}{81n^4} \\cdot 1 = \\frac{16}{81n^4}\\) âï¸

Adding them:

- \\(-\\frac{16}{81} + \\frac{16}{27} - \\frac{16}{27} + \\frac{16}{81}\\)

Convert all to 81 denominators:

- \\(-\\frac{16}{81} + \\frac{48}{81} - \\frac{48}{81} + \\frac{16}{81}\\) = \\((-16 + 48 - 48 + 16)/81 = 0/81 = 0\\)

Wait, that's zero? But how? That contradicts the previous result of \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). There must be a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps the approach of expanding using the binomial theorem for negative exponents is leading to cancellation due to the alternating sums. But why?

Wait, maybe the mistake is that the binomial expansion for \\((1 + x)^{-r}\\) is valid for \\(|x| < 1\\), which is the case here since \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\) and \\(n\\) is large. However, when we interchange the sums, we might be missing some terms or introducing convergence issues. Alternatively, perhaps the first method using the logarithm is more straightforward and correct, but why does the second method give zero?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that when we expand using the binomial theorem, the higher-order terms are not being considered properly. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, when we expand \\(\\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r}\\) using the binomial theorem, we have:

\\[
\\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k
\\]

But then, when we substitute back into the original sum:

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k
\\]

Interchanging the sums:

\\[
S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r (3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k
\\]

= \\(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^k}{(3n)^k} \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r (3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k}\\)

But when summing over \\(r\\), the inner sum is \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\binom{-r}{k} (3n)^{-r}\\). Let's denote \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\), then the inner sum becomes \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} \\binom{-r}{k}\\). 

But \\(\\binom{-r}{k} = (-1)^k \\binom{r + k - 1}{k}\\). Therefore:

Inner sum: \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} (-1)^k \\binom{r + k - 1}{k}\\)

= \\((-1)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\frac{x^r}{r}\\)

Hmm, this seems non-trivial. Maybe there's a generating function or identity that can simplify this sum. Alternatively, perhaps generating functions for the binomial coefficients multiplied by \\(1/r\\).

Alternatively, recall that \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\frac{x^r}{r}\\) is related to the logarithm function. Let me check:

We know that \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} x^r = \\frac{x^k}{(1 - x)^{k + 1}}}\\). But here, we have an extra factor of \\(1/r\\). So perhaps integrating or differentiating the standard generating function.

Alternatively, consider that:

Let \\(S_k = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\frac{x^r}{r}\\)

We can write this as \\(x^{k} \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\frac{(x)^{r - k}}{r}\\)

But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, consider that:

\\(S_k = \\int_0^x \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} t^{r - 1} dt\\)

= \\(\\int_0^x \\frac{1}{(1 - t)^{k + 1}}} dt\\)

= \\(\\int_0^x (1 - t)^{-(k + 1)} dt\\)

= \\(\\left[ \\frac{(1 - t)^{-(k)} }{k} \\right]_0^x\\)

= \\(\\frac{1 - (1 - x)^k}{k}\\)

Therefore, \\(S_k = \\frac{1 - (1 - x)^k}{k}\\)

But this seems too simplistic. Wait, let's verify with \\(k = 0\\):

If \\(k = 0\\), then \\(S_0 = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x)\\), which matches our earlier result. For \\(k = 1\\):

\\(S_1 = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r}{1} \\frac{x^r}{r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{r x^r}{r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty x^r = \\frac{x}{1 - x}\\)

Using the formula \\(S_1 = \\frac{1 - (1 - x)^1}{1} = \\frac{1 - (1 - x)}{1} = x\\), which matches. Similarly, for \\(k = 2\\):

\\(S_2 = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + 1}{2} \\frac{x^r}{r}\\)

Using the formula \\(S_2 = \\frac{1 - (1 - x)^2}{2} = \\frac{1 - (1 - 2x + x^2)}{2} = \\frac{2x - x^2}{2} = x - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\)

But computing directly:

\\(S_2 = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + 1}{2} \\frac{x^r}{r}\\)

= \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(r + 1)r}{2} \\frac{x^r}{r}\\)

= \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty (r + 1) x^r\\)

= \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty r x^r + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty x^r\\)

= \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x}{(1 - x)^2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x}{1 - x}\\)

= \\(\\frac{x}{2(1 - x)^2} + \\frac{x}{2(1 - x)}\\)

= \\(\\frac{x(1 - x) + x(1 - x)^2}{2(1 - x)^2}\\)

= \\(\\frac{x(1 - x + 1 - 2x + x^2)}{2(1 - x)^2}\\)

= \\(\\frac{x(2 - 3x + x^2)}{2(1 - x)^2}\\)

Hmm, this doesn't match the formula \\(S_2 = x - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\). Therefore, there must be an error in the derivation. Let's check the integral approach again.

Earlier, I wrote:

\\(S_k = \\int_0^x \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} t^{r - 1} dt\\)

= \\(\\int_0^x \\frac{1}{(1 - t)^{k + 1}}} dt\\)

But wait, the generating function for \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} t^{r - 1}\\) is indeed \\(\\frac{1}{(1 - t)^{k + 1}}} \\), starting from \\(r = 1\\), so \\(t^{r - 1}\\) starts from \\(t^0\\). Therefore, integrating from 0 to x gives:

\\(\\int_0^x \\frac{1}{(1 - t)^{k + 1}}} dt = \\left[ \\frac{(1 - t)^{-(k)} }{k} \\right]_0^x = \\frac{1 - (1 - x)^k}{k}\\)

But when we computed for \\(k = 2\\), this gives \\(S_2 = \\frac{1 - (1 - x)^2}{2} = \\frac{2x - x^2}{2} = x - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\), but when we compute directly, we get a different expression. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the direct computation.

Wait, let's recalculate \\(S_2\\) directly. 

\\(S_2 = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\binom{r + 1}{2} \\frac{x^r}{r}\\)

= \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(r + 1) r}{2} \\frac{x^r}{r}\\)

= \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(r + 1)}{2} x^r\\)

= \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty (r + 1) x^r\\)

= \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty r x^r + \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty x^r\\)

= \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x}{(1 - x)^2} + \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{x}{1 - x}\\)

= \\(\\frac{x}{2(1 - x)^2} + \\frac{x}{2(1 - x)}\\)

Combine the terms:

= \\(\\frac{x + x(1 - x)}{2(1 - x)^2}\\)

= \\(\\frac{x + x - x^2}{2(1 - x)^2}\\)

= \\(\\frac{2x - x^2}{2(1 - x)^2}\\)

= \\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{2(1 - x)^2}\\)

But according to the integral method, \\(S_2 = x - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\). These two expressions must be equal:

\\(\\frac{x(2 - x)}{2(1 - x)^2} = x - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\)

Let's test with x = 0.5:

Left side: (0.5)(2 - 0.5)/(2*(1 - 0.5)^2) = (0.5)(1.5)/(2*0.25) = 0.75 / 0.5 = 1.5

Right side: 0.5 - 0.5^2 / 2 = 0.5 - 0.125 = 0.375

Not equal. Therefore, the integral approach must be incorrect.

This suggests that my earlier derivation is flawed. Therefore, the approach of expanding via binomial theorem and interchanging sums is leading to inconsistencies, likely due to the complexity of handling the double sums and generalized binomial coefficients.

Given that, perhaps the first method using the logarithm expansion is more reliable and correct. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). However, the user claims the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which is positive and doesn't match. There must be a mistake either in the problem statement or in the user's provided answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem was to find the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) in the polynomial expansion of \\(S\\), but that doesn't make sense because \\(S\\) is a series in \\(1/n\\). Alternatively, perhaps the problem was stated differently, such as finding the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) in some expression related to \\(S\\), but as stated, it's about \\(1/n^4\\).

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and the answer should be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). Alternatively, perhaps I missed a negative sign somewhere.

Wait, going back to the first method:

\\(S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\)

Expanding this as a Taylor series gives:

\\[
\\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots
\\]

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). This is approximately \\(-0.0494\\), while \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is approximately 0.6667, which are very different. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation, the correct answer should be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement or the provided answer. Alternatively, maybe I misapplied the logarithm expansion.

Wait, let's compute the expansion again step by step.

Given \\(S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\)

Let me denote \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\), then:

\\[
\\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Substitute \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\):

First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)

Second term: \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)

Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 = -\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). Therefore, unless there's a different interpretation of the problem, this should be the correct answer.

Given that the user provided an answer of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which is positive and doesn't match the derived result, there might be a misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem was to find the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) in the expansion of \\(S\\) around \\(n = 0\\), but that would be different. Alternatively, perhaps the problem was stated incorrectly, and the summation is over \\(r\\) with a different exponent.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem was to find the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) in the expansion of \\(S\\) as a polynomial in \\(n\\), but since \\(S\\) is a series in \\(1/n\\), that wouldn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) in the series expansion of \\(S\\) as a Laurent series around \\(n = \\infty\\), which is exactly what I did, and the answer is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Given all this, I think the correct answer is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). The user's stated answer of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is likely incorrect, possibly due to a miscalculation or misstatement.

**Final Answer**
The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Thus, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

","Okay, let's see. I need to find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the series S, which is given by the sum from r=1 to infinity of 2^r divided by [r(3n + 2)^r]. Hmm, so the series is S = Î£_{r=1}^â [2^r / (r(3n + 2)^r)]. The question is asking for the coefficient of 1/n^4 in this series. 

First, let me try to understand the structure of the series. Each term in the series is 2^r divided by r times (3n + 2)^r. So, each term is of the form (2/(3n + 2))^r / r. Wait, that's interesting. Because 2^r / (3n + 2)^r is the same as (2/(3n + 2))^r. So the series becomes S = Î£_{r=1}^â [ (2/(3n + 2))^r / r ].

Now, I recall that the Taylor series expansion for -ln(1 - x) is Î£_{r=1}^â x^r / r. So if I can express the given series in terms of a logarithm, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for S, and then expand that into a series in 1/n to find the coefficient of 1/n^4.

Let me verify that. The series Î£_{r=1}^â x^r / r is indeed equal to -ln(1 - x) for |x| < 1. So, if I let x = 2/(3n + 2), then the given series S would be equal to -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)). Let me check that substitution:

S = Î£_{r=1}^â [ (2/(3n + 2))^r / r ] = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)).

Yes, that seems right. So, simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

1 - 2/(3n + 2) = (3n + 2 - 2)/(3n + 2) = 3n/(3n + 2). Therefore, S = -ln(3n/(3n + 2)) = ln((3n + 2)/3n) = ln(1 + 2/(3n)).

Wait, so S = ln(1 + 2/(3n)). That's a simpler expression. Now, the problem is to find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the expansion of this logarithm.

So, we need to expand ln(1 + 2/(3n)) as a series in terms of 1/n, up to the 1/n^4 term. Let me recall the Taylor series expansion for ln(1 + x). The expansion is x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ... for |x| < 1. 

Here, x = 2/(3n). So substituting x into the expansion:

ln(1 + 2/(3n)) = (2/(3n)) - (2/(3n))^2 / 2 + (2/(3n))^3 / 3 - (2/(3n))^4 / 4 + ... 

Therefore, expanding each term:

First term: 2/(3n)

Second term: - (4)/(9n^2) / 2 = -2/(9n^2)

Third term: (8)/(27n^3) / 3 = 8/(81n^3)

Fourth term: - (16)/(81n^4) / 4 = -4/(81n^4)

Wait, hold on. Let me compute each term step by step.

Term 1: x = 2/(3n) => coefficient of 1/n is 2/3.

Term 2: x^2 / 2 = (4/(9n^2)) / 2 = (4/18)/n^2 = 2/9. So the coefficient is -2/9 for 1/n^2.

Term 3: x^3 / 3 = (8/(27n^3)) / 3 = 8/(81n^3). So the coefficient is +8/81 for 1/n^3.

Term 4: x^4 / 4 = (16/(81n^4)) / 4 = 4/(81n^4). So the coefficient is -4/81 for 1/n^4.

Therefore, the expansion up to 1/n^4 is:

ln(1 + 2/(3n)) = (2/3)(1/n) - (2/9)(1/n^2) + (8/81)(1/n^3) - (4/81)(1/n^4) + ... 

Therefore, the coefficient of 1/n^4 is -4/81.

Wait, but let me verify that again. Let's compute term by term:

Term 1: x = 2/(3n) => coefficient is 2/3 for 1/n.

Term 2: x^2 / 2 = (2/(3n))^2 / 2 = (4/(9n^2)) / 2 = 2/(9n^2). So coefficient is -2/9 for 1/n^2.

Term 3: x^3 / 3 = (2/(3n))^3 / 3 = (8/(27n^3)) / 3 = 8/(81n^3). Coefficient is +8/81 for 1/n^3.

Term 4: x^4 / 4 = (2/(3n))^4 / 4 = (16/(81n^4)) / 4 = 4/(81n^4). Coefficient is -4/81 for 1/n^4.

Yes, that seems correct. So the coefficient of 1/n^4 is -4/81.

But wait, the problem statement mentions that the answer is 2/3. Hmm, that can't be. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, let me check again. The original series was S = sum_{r=1}^infty [2^r / (r(3n + 2)^r)]. Then I rewrote it as sum_{r=1}^infty [ (2/(3n + 2))^r / r ] which is equal to -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)) as per the logarithm series. Then I simplified the argument inside the logarithm to get ln(1 + 2/(3n)). Then expanded that into a series in terms of 1/n. And found the coefficient of 1/n^4 as -4/81. But the problem says the answer is 2/3. That must be incorrect. Wait, maybe I did something wrong here.

Wait, maybe the problem is written differently. Let me check again. The problem says ""Find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the series S = sum_{r=1}^\\infty [2^r/(r(3n + 2)^r)]. The answer is 2/3."" So according to the user, the answer is 2/3, but according to my calculation, it's -4/81. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, likely I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps I messed up the substitution. Let me check again.

Original series: S = sum_{r=1}^\\infty [2^r / (r(3n + 2)^r)].

Let me factor out 1/(3n + 2)^r: S = sum_{r=1}^\\infty [ (2/(3n + 2))^r / r ].

Yes, that's correct. Then, the series sum_{r=1}^\\infty x^r / r = -ln(1 - x). So substituting x = 2/(3n + 2), S = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)).

Simplify the argument: 1 - 2/(3n + 2) = (3n + 2 - 2)/(3n + 2) = 3n/(3n + 2). Therefore, S = -ln(3n/(3n + 2)) = ln((3n + 2)/3n) = ln(1 + 2/(3n)). So that's correct.

Therefore, expanding ln(1 + 2/(3n)) as a series in 1/n. Let me note that 2/(3n) is a small term if n is large. So the expansion is valid.

But let's write the expansion again:

ln(1 + x) = x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ... where x = 2/(3n). Therefore:

ln(1 + 2/(3n)) = (2/(3n)) - (2/(3n))^2 / 2 + (2/(3n))^3 / 3 - (2/(3n))^4 / 4 + ... 

Calculating each term:

First term: 2/(3n) = (2/3)(1/n)

Second term: - (4/(9n^2)) / 2 = - (4/18)(1/n^2) = - (2/9)(1/n^2)

Third term: (8/(27n^3)) / 3 = (8/81)(1/n^3)

Fourth term: - (16/(81n^4)) / 4 = - (4/81)(1/n^4)

Fifth term: (32/(243n^5)) / 5 = (32/1215)(1/n^5)

And so on. Therefore, the expansion is:

(2/3)(1/n) - (2/9)(1/n^2) + (8/81)(1/n^3) - (4/81)(1/n^4) + (32/1215)(1/n^5) - ... 

Therefore, the coefficient of 1/n^4 is -4/81. But the user says the answer is 2/3. Hmm. There must be a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the logarithm simplification. Let me check:

S = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)) = -ln( (3n + 2 - 2)/(3n + 2) ) = -ln(3n/(3n + 2)) = ln( (3n + 2)/3n ) = ln(1 + 2/(3n)). Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written differently. Wait, perhaps the series is S = sum_{r=1}^\\infty [2^r / (r(3n + 2)^r)], and we need the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the expansion of S.

But according to my calculation, that's -4/81. But the user says the answer is 2/3. Therefore, perhaps I need to check again.

Wait, let's try another approach. Maybe instead of using the logarithm, expand each term in the series and collect terms up to 1/n^4. Let's see.

Each term in the series is (2/(3n + 2))^r / r. Let's write 3n + 2 = 3n(1 + 2/(3n)). Therefore, 1/(3n + 2)^r = 1/(3^n n^r (1 + 2/(3n))^r). So the term becomes (2^r)/(3^r n^r (1 + 2/(3n))^r) / r = (1/(3n))^r (1 + 2/(3n))^{-r} / r.

But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps expand 1/(3n + 2)^r as a series in 1/n.

Let me write 3n + 2 = 3n(1 + 2/(3n)), so 1/(3n + 2)^r = (1/(3n)^r)(1 + 2/(3n))^{-r}. Then using the binomial expansion for (1 + x)^{-r} where x = 2/(3n), which is small for large n.

So, (1 + 2/(3n))^{-r} = Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) (2/(3n))^k.

Therefore, each term in the original series is:

(2/(3n))^r / r * (1 + 2/(3n))^{-r} = (2/(3n))^r / r * Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) (2/(3n))^k.

Therefore, expanding each term:

= Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) (2/(3n))^k * (2/(3n))^r / r

= Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) (2^{k + r})/(3^{k + r} n^{k + r}) / r

= Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) 2^{r + k} / (3^{r + k} r n^{r + k})

Then, the original series S is the sum over r from 1 to infinity of this expression. Therefore:

S = Î£_{r=1}^\\infty [ Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) 2^{r + k} / (3^{r + k} r n^{r + k}) ]

This looks complicated. Maybe swap the order of summations:

S = Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k 2^k / 3^k Î£_{r=1}^\\infty [ C(r + k - 1, k) 2^r / (3^r r n^{r + k}) ]

Let me denote m = r + k, but this might not help. Alternatively, notice that C(r + k - 1, k) is the same as C(r + k - 1, r - 1). Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps change variables: let m = r + k. Then, for each m >= 1 + 0 = 1, k can go from 0 to m - 1. So:

S = Î£_{m=1}^\\infty [ Î£_{k=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^k C(m - 1, k) 2^{m - k} / (3^{m - k} (m - k) n^m) ) ]

But this seems even more complicated. Maybe this approach is not the best.

Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding each term (2/(3n + 2))^r / r as a series in 1/n, then sum over r. Let's try that.

First, let's write 3n + 2 = 3n(1 + 2/(3n)). Then, 1/(3n + 2) = 1/(3n) * 1/(1 + 2/(3n)) = 1/(3n) * Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k (2/(3n))^k, for |2/(3n)| < 1, which is true for large n.

Therefore, 1/(3n + 2)^r = [1/(3n)]^r Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) (2/(3n))^k.

Therefore, (2/(3n + 2))^r = 2^r / (3n + 2)^r = 2^r [1/(3n)]^r Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) (2/(3n))^k.

Therefore, each term in the series S is:

(2/(3n + 2))^r / r = 2^r / r [1/(3n)]^r Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) (2/(3n))^k.

= Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) 2^{r + k} / (3^{r + k} r n^{r + k}).

Thus, S = Î£_{r=1}^\\infty Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) 2^{r + k} / (3^{r + k} r n^{r + k}).

Again, swapping the order of summation:

S = Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k 2^k / 3^k Î£_{r=1}^\\infty [ C(r + k - 1, k) 2^r / (3^r r n^{r + k}) ].

Let me denote m = r + k. Then, for each k >= 0, r = m - k, starting from m = k + 1. So:

S = Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k 2^k / 3^k Î£_{m = k + 1}^\\infty [ C(m - 1, k) 2^{m - k} / (3^{m - k} (m - k) n^m) ].

Again, this seems complicated, but maybe we can change variables to m:

S = Î£_{m=1}^\\infty [ Î£_{k=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^k 2^k / 3^k C(m - 1, k) 2^{m - k} / (3^{m - k} (m - k) n^m) ].

Simplifying inside the inner sum:

= Î£_{m=1}^\\infty [ Î£_{k=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^k 2^{k + m - k} / (3^{k + m - k}) C(m - 1, k) / (m - k) n^m ]

= Î£_{m=1}^\\infty [ Î£_{k=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^k 2^m / 3^m C(m - 1, k) / (m - k) n^m ]

Factor out 2^m / 3^m n^m:

= Î£_{m=1}^\\infty [ (2^m / 3^m n^m) Î£_{k=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^k C(m - 1, k) / (m - k) ) ]

Now, focus on the inner sum: Î£_{k=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^k C(m - 1, k) / (m - k)

Let me substitute l = m - k. Then, when k = 0, l = m; when k = m - 1, l = 1. So reversing the order:

Î£_{l=1}^m (-1)^{m - l} C(m - 1, m - l) / l

= Î£_{l=1}^m (-1)^{m - l} C(m - 1, l - 1) / l

But C(m - 1, l - 1) = C(m - 1, l - 1) and (-1)^{m - l} = (-1)^{m} (-1)^{-l} = (-1)^m (-1)^l.

Therefore, the inner sum becomes:

(-1)^m Î£_{l=1}^m (-1)^l C(m - 1, l - 1) / l

Let me set j = l - 1, so j goes from 0 to m - 1:

= (-1)^m Î£_{j=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^{j + 1} C(m - 1, j) / (j + 1)

= (-1)^m (-1) Î£_{j=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^j C(m - 1, j) / (j + 1)

= (-1)^{m + 1} Î£_{j=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^j C(m - 1, j) / (j + 1)

Hmm, now this seems challenging. Maybe there's a generating function or known identity for this sum.

Recall that Î£_{j=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^j C(m - 1, j) / (j + 1) = [1/m] Î£_{j=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^j C(m, j + 1).

Because C(m - 1, j) = C(m, j + 1) * (j + 1)/m. Wait, let's check:

C(m, j + 1) = m! / [(j + 1)! (m - j - 1)!] = [m / (j + 1)] * [(m - 1)! / (j! (m - j - 1)! )] = [m / (j + 1)] C(m - 1, j).

Therefore, C(m - 1, j) = C(m, j + 1) * (j + 1)/m.

Therefore, Î£_{j=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^j C(m - 1, j) / (j + 1) = Î£_{j=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^j C(m, j + 1)/m = (1/m) Î£_{j=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^j C(m, j + 1).

Let me change variables: let k = j + 1. Then, k goes from 1 to m.

= (1/m) Î£_{k=1}^m (-1)^{k - 1} C(m, k)

= (1/m) [ Î£_{k=0}^m (-1)^k C(m, k) - (-1)^0 C(m, 0) ]

= (1/m) [ (1 - 1)^m - 1 ] = (1/m) [ 0 - 1 ] = -1/m.

Therefore, the inner sum Î£_{j=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^j C(m - 1, j) / (j + 1) = -1/m.

Therefore, going back to the previous expression:

Inner sum = (-1)^{m + 1} * (-1/m) = (-1)^{m + 1} * (-1)/m = (-1)^{m + 2}/m = (-1)^m / m.

Wait, let's check:

We had:

Inner sum = (-1)^{m + 1} * [-1/m] = (-1)^{m + 1} * (-1/m) = (-1)^{m} / m.

Yes, because (-1)^{m + 1} * (-1) = (-1)^{m + 2} = (-1)^m.

Therefore, the inner sum is (-1)^m / m.

Therefore, going back to S:

S = Î£_{m=1}^\\infty [ (2^m / 3^m n^m) * (-1)^m / m ]

= Î£_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-2/3)^m / m * 1/n^m ]

= Î£_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-2/(3n))^m / m ]

Which is exactly the series for -ln(1 + 2/(3n)), which matches our previous result. Therefore, this confirms that S = -ln(1 + 2/(3n)) = ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)) as before.

Therefore, the expansion is indeed (2/3)(1/n) - (2/9)(1/n^2) + (8/81)(1/n^3) - (4/81)(1/n^4) + ... So the coefficient of 1/n^4 is -4/81.

But the user says the answer is 2/3. There must be a mistake somewhere. Let me check once again.

Wait, maybe I need to consider the expansion of S as a Laurent series around n = 0? Wait, but n is a variable here, not a small parameter. Wait, the problem is to find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the series S. But S is expressed as a sum over r, and we need to expand that sum into a series in 1/n. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or maybe I misread it. Let me check again.

The problem is to find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the series S = Î£_{r=1}^\\infty [2^r/(r(3n + 2)^r)]. The answer is given as 2/3. But according to my calculations, the coefficient is -4/81. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written differently. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe the series is S = Î£_{r=1}^\\infty [2^r/(r(3n + 2)^r)], and we need to find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in this series. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider expanding each term in the series as a power series in 1/n and then summing the coefficients up to 1/n^4. Let's try this approach.

Each term in the series is (2/(3n + 2))^r / r. Let's expand 1/(3n + 2) as a series in 1/n:

1/(3n + 2) = 1/(3n(1 + 2/(3n))) = (1/(3n)) * Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k (2/(3n))^k, valid for |2/(3n)| < 1, i.e., |n| > 2/3. 

Therefore, (2/(3n + 2))^r = 2^r / (3n + 2)^r = 2^r [1/(3n)]^r Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) (2/(3n))^k.

Therefore, each term in the series is:

(2/(3n + 2))^r / r = Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) 2^{r + k} / (3^{r + k} r n^{r + k}).

Therefore, the entire series S is:

S = Î£_{r=1}^\\infty Î£_{k=0}^\\infty (-1)^k C(r + k - 1, k) 2^{r + k} / (3^{r + k} r n^{r + k}).

To find the coefficient of 1/n^4, we need to collect all terms where r + k = 4. So, for each m = 4, we have r and k such that r + k = 4, with r >= 1 and k >= 0. Therefore, possible pairs (r, k) are:

r = 1, k = 3

r = 2, k = 2

r = 3, k = 1

r = 4, k = 0

For each of these pairs, compute the coefficient and sum them up.

Let's compute each term:

1. For r = 1, k = 3:

Coefficient = (-1)^3 C(1 + 3 - 1, 3) 2^{1 + 3} / (3^{1 + 3} * 1 * n^{4})

= (-1)^3 C(3, 3) 2^4 / (3^4 * 1)

= (-1)^3 * 1 * 16 / (81)

= (-1) * 16 / 81 = -16/81

2. For r = 2, k = 2:

Coefficient = (-1)^2 C(2 + 2 - 1, 2) 2^{2 + 2} / (3^{2 + 2} * 2 * n^{4})

= 1 * C(3, 2) * 16 / (81 * 2)

= 1 * 3 * 16 / 162

= 48 / 162 = 8 / 27 â 0.296...

3. For r = 3, k = 1:

Coefficient = (-1)^1 C(3 + 1 - 1, 1) 2^{3 + 1} / (3^{3 + 1} * 3 * n^{4})

= (-1) * C(3, 1) * 16 / (81 * 3)

= (-1) * 3 * 16 / 243

= -48 / 243 = -16 / 81 â -0.197...

4. For r = 4, k = 0:

Coefficient = (-1)^0 C(4 + 0 - 1, 0) 2^{4 + 0} / (3^{4 + 0} * 4 * n^{4})

= 1 * C(3, 0) * 16 / (81 * 4)

= 1 * 1 * 16 / 324

= 16 / 324 = 4 / 81 â 0.049...

Now, summing all these coefficients:

-16/81 + 8/27 + (-16/81) + 4/81

Convert all to 81 denominator:

-16/81 + 24/81 -16/81 + 4/81 = (-16 + 24 -16 + 4)/81 = (-16 + 24) = 8; 8 -16 = -8; -8 +4 = -4. So total is -4/81.

Therefore, the coefficient of 1/n^4 is -4/81. But the user says the answer is 2/3. There's a discrepancy here. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check the individual terms again.

First term (r=1, k=3):

C(3,3) = 1, 2^4 = 16, 3^4 = 81, denominator is 1 * 81. So coefficient is (-1)^3 * 1 * 16 / (81) = -16/81.

Second term (r=2, k=2):

C(3,2) = 3, 2^4 = 16, 3^4 = 81, denominator is 2 * 81. So coefficient is 1 * 3 * 16 / (2 * 81) = (48)/(162) = 8/27.

Third term (r=3, k=1):

C(3,1) = 3, 2^4 = 16, 3^4 = 81, denominator is 3 * 81. Coefficient is (-1) * 3 * 16 / (3 * 81) = (-16)/81.

Fourth term (r=4, k=0):

C(3,0) = 1, 2^4 = 16, 3^4 = 81, denominator is 4 * 81. Coefficient is 1 * 1 * 16 / (4 * 81) = 16 / 324 = 4/81.

Adding them up:

-16/81 + 8/27 + (-16/81) + 4/81.

Convert 8/27 to 24/81:

-16/81 + 24/81 -16/81 +4/81 = (-16 +24 -16 +4)/81 = (-16 +24) = 8; 8 -16 = -8; -8 +4 = -4. So total is -4/81.

This confirms the previous result. Therefore, the coefficient of 1/n^4 is indeed -4/81, not 2/3. Therefore, either the user provided the wrong answer, or there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of n^4 instead of 1/n^4? But the user clearly says 1/n^4. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the expansion. Let me check the expansion of ln(1 + 2/(3n)) again.

We have:

ln(1 + x) = x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ... where x = 2/(3n).

So:

ln(1 + 2/(3n)) = (2/(3n)) - (2/(3n))^2 / 2 + (2/(3n))^3 / 3 - (2/(3n))^4 / 4 + ... 

Calculating each term:

First term: 2/(3n) = (2/3)(1/n)

Second term: - (4/(9n^2)) / 2 = -2/(9n^2)

Third term: (8/(27n^3)) / 3 = 8/(81n^3)

Fourth term: - (16/(81n^4)) / 4 = -4/(81n^4)

Fifth term: + (32/(243n^5)) / 5 = 32/(1215n^5)

Etc. So the expansion is correct up to 1/n^4.

Therefore, the coefficient of 1/n^4 is indeed -4/81. Therefore, the correct answer should be -4/81, not 2/3. 

But the user mentioned that the answer is 2/3. This suggests either a mistake in the problem statement or perhaps a miscalculation by the user. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the series.

Wait, let's re-examine the original series:

S = Î£_{r=1}^\\infty [2^r / (r(3n + 2)^r)].

Is there a different way to interpret this series? For example, perhaps the summation is over n instead of r? But no, the summation is over r from 1 to infinity, and n is a variable. So the series is in terms of 1/n.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of n^4 instead of 1/n^4. If that were the case, the coefficient would be zero because the series only has negative powers of n. But the user says 1/n^4.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves expanding around a different point. For example, expanding around n = something else. But no, the problem is straightforward: find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the series.

Given that both approachesâdirect expansion of the logarithm and expanding each term and summingâgive the same result of -4/81, and the user's claim of 2/3 is inconsistent, I must conclude that the correct answer is -4/81. Therefore, there might be an error in the user's provided answer.

But to be thorough, let me check once again.

Alternative approach: Let's compute the expansion of S up to 1/n^4 directly.

Given S = ln(1 + 2/(3n)).

Expand this using the Taylor series:

ln(1 + x) = x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + ..., x = 2/(3n).

So:

S = (2/(3n)) - (2/(3n))^2 / 2 + (2/(3n))^3 / 3 - (2/(3n))^4 / 4 + ... 

Compute each term:

First term: 2/(3n) = (2/3)(1/n)

Second term: - (4/(9n^2)) / 2 = - (2/9)(1/n^2)

Third term: + (8/(27n^3)) / 3 = + (8/81)(1/n^3)

Fourth term: - (16/(81n^4)) / 4 = - (4/81)(1/n^4)

Fifth term: + (32/(243n^5)) / 5 = + (32/1215)(1/n^5)

So indeed, the coefficient of 1/n^4 is -4/81. 

Therefore, the answer must be -4/81. The user's claim of 2/3 is incorrect. Perhaps the user confused the coefficient with something else, or there's a typo in the problem. However, based on the calculations, the correct coefficient is -4/81.

**Final Answer**

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of 1/nâ´ in the series S, which is given by the sum from r=1 to infinity of (2^r)/(r(3n + 2)^r). Hmm, let's see. I remember that such series might be related to logarithmic expansions or something like that. Let me think step by step.

First, the general term in the series is (2^r)/(r(3n + 2)^r). Maybe I can rewrite this term in a way that makes the series more familiar. Let's factor out the constants. The denominator is r times (3n + 2)^r. The numerator is 2^r. So, combining those, the term becomes (2/(3n + 2))^r / r. 

Wait, that looks similar to the terms in the Taylor series expansion of a logarithm. The standard expansion for -ln(1 - x) is x + xÂ²/2 + xÂ³/3 + xâ´/4 + ... for |x| < 1. So, if I can express the given series in terms of such a logarithmic expansion, maybe I can find the coefficient.

Let me check: If I let x = 2/(3n + 2), then the term becomes x^r / r. So the sum from r=1 to infinity of x^r / r is indeed -ln(1 - x). Therefore, the original series S is equal to -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)). Let me verify that:

S = sum_{r=1}^â [2^r / (r(3n + 2)^r)] = sum_{r=1}^â [ (2/(3n + 2))^r / r ] = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)).

Yes, that seems correct. So, S = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)). Let me simplify the argument inside the logarithm:

1 - 2/(3n + 2) = (3n + 2 - 2)/(3n + 2) = 3n/(3n + 2). Therefore, S = -ln(3n/(3n + 2)) = ln((3n + 2)/3n) = ln(1 + 2/(3n)).

Wait, that's a better way to write it. So S = ln(1 + 2/(3n)). Now, the task is to find the coefficient of 1/nâ´ in the expansion of this logarithm. So I need to expand ln(1 + 2/(3n)) as a series in powers of 1/n and find the term with 1/nâ´.

To do this, I can use the Taylor series expansion for ln(1 + x), which is x - xÂ²/2 + xÂ³/3 - xâ´/4 + ... for |x| < 1. Here, x = 2/(3n). So substituting x into the expansion:

ln(1 + 2/(3n)) = (2/(3n)) - (2/(3n))Â²/2 + (2/(3n))Â³/3 - (2/(3n))â´/4 + ... 

Let me compute each term up to 1/nâ´:

First term: 2/(3n) = (2/3)/n

Second term: -( (2/(3n))Â² ) / 2 = - (4/(9nÂ²)) / 2 = -2/(9nÂ²)

Third term: ( (2/(3n))Â³ ) / 3 = (8/(27nÂ³)) / 3 = 8/(81nÂ³)

Fourth term: - ( (2/(3n))â´ ) / 4 = - (16/(81nâ´)) / 4 = -4/(81nâ´)

So the expansion up to the 1/nâ´ term is:

(2/3)/n - 2/(9nÂ²) + 8/(81nÂ³) - 4/(81nâ´) + ...

Therefore, the coefficient of 1/nâ´ is -4/81. But wait, the question says to find the coefficient of 1/nâ´ in the series S. However, in the problem statement, the user wrote ""Find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the series S = sum_{r=1}^\\infty 2^r/(r(3n+2)^r).frac{2}{3}"". Wait, the last part with .frac{2}{3} seems like a typo or maybe a misplaced fraction. But assuming the original problem is correctly stated, the coefficient is -4/81.

But let me check again. The user might have intended to write the problem as S = sum_{r=1}^\\infty 2^r/(r(3n+2)^r), and then the answer is -4/81. But just to be sure, let's re-examine the steps.

Starting with S = sum_{r=1}^â [2^r/(r(3n + 2)^r)] = sum_{r=1}^â [ (2/(3n + 2))^r / r ] = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)). Then simplifying that expression gives ln((3n + 2)/3n) = ln(1 + 2/(3n)). Expanding that logarithm as a Taylor series gives the terms up to 1/n^4 as calculated. So the coefficient is indeed -4/81.

Wait, but maybe I made a miscalculation in the expansion. Let me verify each term again:

First term: x = 2/(3n), so the first term is x = 2/(3n).

Second term: -xÂ²/2 = - (4/(9nÂ²))/2 = -2/(9nÂ²). Correct.

Third term: xÂ³/3 = (8/(27nÂ³))/3 = 8/(81nÂ³). Correct.

Fourth term: -xâ´/4 = - (16/(81nâ´))/4 = -4/(81nâ´). Correct.

So yes, the coefficient of 1/n^4 is -4/81. Therefore, the answer should be -4/81. However, the problem statement mentions ""frac{2}{3}"" at the end, which might be a red herring or a typo. If the problem had asked for the coefficient of 1/n in a different context, but as written, the answer is -4/81.

Wait, but let me check if I interpreted the original series correctly. The series is sum_{r=1}^â (2^r)/(r(3n + 2)^r). Let me check if there's a different approach. For example, maybe expanding 1/(3n + 2)^r as a series in terms of 1/n. Let's try that.

First, note that 1/(3n + 2)^r = (1/(3n))^r * (1/(1 + 2/(3n)))^r = (1/(3n))^r * (1 - 2/(3n) + (2/(3n))Â² - (2/(3n))Â³ + ... )^r, using the binomial expansion for (1 + x)^{-r} where x = -2/(3n). But this might get complicated for higher r. Alternatively, maybe using generating functions or considering the series as a function of n.

But the approach I took earlier seems correct because the sum over r of x^r / r is -ln(1 - x), so substituting x = 2/(3n + 2) gives the expression. Then simplifying the logarithm gives the expansion in terms of 1/n. Therefore, I think the coefficient is indeed -4/81.

Wait, but let me check if there's an alternative way. Suppose I write S as sum_{r=1}^â (2/(3n + 2))^r / r = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)), which is correct. Then, let me compute 1 - 2/(3n + 2) = (3n + 2 - 2)/(3n + 2) = 3n/(3n + 2). So S = -ln(3n/(3n + 2)) = ln((3n + 2)/3n) = ln(1 + 2/(3n)). So yes, same as before.

Therefore, expanding ln(1 + 2/(3n)) as a Taylor series in terms of 1/n, the expansion is:

2/(3n) - (2/(3n))Â²/2 + (2/(3n))Â³/3 - (2/(3n))â´/4 + ... 

So each term is (2/(3n))^k / k with alternating signs starting from positive. Therefore, the coefficient for 1/n^4 term is - (2^4)/(3^4 * 4) = -16/(81*4) = -4/81. So that's correct.

Therefore, the coefficient of 1/n^4 is -4/81. However, the problem statement mentions ""frac{2}{3}"" at the end. Maybe there was a misinterpretation. Wait, perhaps the original problem had a different exponent or coefficient? Let me recheck the problem statement.

Original problem: ""Find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the series S = sum_{r=1}^\\infty 2^r/(r(3n+2)^r).frac{2}{3}"". The "".frac{2}{3}"" seems like a misplaced fraction or perhaps a typo. If the problem is correctly stated, the answer is -4/81. Alternatively, if there was a different exponent or coefficient in the original problem, the answer would differ. But based on the given information, the steps are correct, and the coefficient is -4/81.

Wait, but maybe I need to check if the expansion is correct. Let me compute the expansion step by step again.

Let x = 2/(3n). Then ln(1 + x) = x - xÂ²/2 + xÂ³/3 - xâ´/4 + xâµ/5 - ... So substituting x:

ln(1 + 2/(3n)) = (2/(3n)) - (2/(3n))Â²/2 + (2/(3n))Â³/3 - (2/(3n))â´/4 + ...

Calculating each term:

- First term: 2/(3n)

- Second term: -(4/(9nÂ²))/2 = -2/(9nÂ²)

- Third term: (8/(27nÂ³))/3 = 8/(81nÂ³)

- Fourth term: -(16/(81nâ´))/4 = -4/(81nâ´)

So yes, the coefficient of 1/n^4 is -4/81.

Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}.

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Thus, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). Hmm, let's start by understanding what the series is. The series is an infinite sum starting from \\(r=1\\) to infinity, with each term being \\(\\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). 

First, maybe I can rewrite the general term in a more manageable form. Let's see, the denominator is \\(r(3n+2)^r\\), and the numerator is \\(2^r\\). So each term is \\(\\frac{(2/(3n+2))^r}{r}\\). That looks familiar. Wait, that's similar to the expansion of a logarithm. The Taylor series for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\) is \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r}\\). So if I can express the given series in terms of such a logarithm, maybe I can find a closed-form expression for \\(S\\) and then expand it to find the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\).

Let's try that. Let me set \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\). Then the series becomes \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x)\\). Therefore, \\(S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). Let me check that substitution again. Yes, if \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\), then the term is \\(\\frac{(2/(3n+2))^r}{r}\\), which matches the series expansion of \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\). So that's a good step.

Now, simplifying the argument inside the logarithm: \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\). Let's compute that. 

\\(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{(3n + 2) - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\). Therefore, the series \\(S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right)\\). Alternatively, this can be written as \\(\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right)\\) since logarithm properties allow us to flip the argument by taking the negative. So \\(S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). Wait, let me verify that step again. 

Starting from \\(S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right)\\), that's equivalent to \\(\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right)\\), which simplifies to \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). Yes, that's correct. So \\(S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). 

Now, I need to expand this logarithm into a power series in terms of \\(1/n\\) and find the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\). The function \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\) has a Taylor series expansion around \\(x = 0\\) given by \\(x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots\\). However, in this case, our \\(x\\) is \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\), which is a small term as \\(n\\) becomes large. So substituting \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\) into the expansion, we get:

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 + \\cdots
\\]

Simplifying each term:

First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)

Second term: \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)

Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

And so on. Therefore, the expansion up to \\(1/n^4\\) is:

\\[
\\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots
\\]

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). Wait, but the problem states that the answer should be \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Hmm, that's conflicting. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, perhaps I need to check my steps again. Let's go back.

First, the original series is \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). I set \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\), then \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x)\\). So substituting back, \\(S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). Then simplifying the argument:

\\(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\). So \\(S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right)\\). Then, as before, this is \\(\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). Then expanding \\(\\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})\\):

Yes, that expansion is correct. The series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\) is indeed \\(x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots\\). So substituting \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\), we get the terms as calculated. So the coefficient for \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). But the problem says the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). That's a contradiction. Did I miscalculate?

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement? Or maybe my approach is wrong. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\), and the user wants the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) in the expansion of \\(S\\). According to my calculation, it's \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). But the user says the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Hmm. Maybe I need to re-express \\(S\\) differently.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the logarithm step. Let me verify:

Starting with \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let's factor out \\(1/(3n + 2)\\):

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n + 2))^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2))\\). Yes, that's correct. So \\(S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right)\\). Then, writing this as \\(\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right)\\) which is \\(\\ln(1 + 2/(3n))\\). Then expanding in terms of \\(1/n\\):

Yes, the expansion is \\(2/(3n) - (2/(3n))^2/2 + (2/(3n))^3/3 - (2/(3n))^4/4 + \\cdots\\). So, when expanded, each term is:

First term: \\(2/(3n)\\)

Second term: \\(- (4/(9n^2))/2 = -2/(9n^2)\\)

Third term: \\(8/(27n^3)/3 = 8/(81n^3)\\)

Fourth term: \\(-16/(81n^4)/4 = -4/(81n^4)\\)

So indeed, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-4/81\\). But the problem states the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). That's a big discrepancy. Maybe there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, perhaps the original problem is written differently. Let me check again the problem statement: ""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\)."" The user also mentions ""the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)"", but according to my calculations, it's \\(-4/81\\). Maybe I made a mistake in the expansion steps.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is to find the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) in the expansion of \\(S\\) around \\(n = 0\\), but \\(n\\) is in the denominator here, so maybe expanding around \\(1/n = 0\\), treating \\(1/n\\) as a small parameter. But in that case, the expansion is as done above.

Wait, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider expanding \\(S\\) as a power series in \\(1/n\\). Let me write \\(S\\) as:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let's factor out \\(1/(3n + 2)\\):

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n + 2))^r}{r}\\). Let me set \\(x = 2/(3n + 2)\\). Then, \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x)\\). So, \\(S = -\\ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2))\\). Then, expanding this logarithm.

But if I want to expand \\(S\\) as a power series in \\(1/n\\), maybe I need to express \\(1/(3n + 2)\\) as a series in \\(1/n\\). Let's do that.

First, \\(1/(3n + 2) = \\frac{1}{3n(1 + 2/(3n))} = \\frac{1}{3n} \\times \\frac{1}{1 + 2/(3n)}\\). Then, using the expansion \\(\\frac{1}{1 + x} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\cdots\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\), so here \\(x = 2/(3n)\\). Therefore,

\\(1/(3n + 2) = \\frac{1}{3n}\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n} + \\frac{4}{9n^2} - \\frac{8}{27n^3} + \\cdots \\right)\\).

Therefore, \\(2/(3n + 2) = 2 \\times \\frac{1}{3n}\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n} + \\frac{4}{9n^2} - \\frac{8}{27n^3} + \\cdots \\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{4}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{27n^3} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\cdots\\).

Then, \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n + 2))^r}{r}\\). Let me denote \\(x = 2/(3n + 2)\\), so \\(S = -\\ln(1 - x)\\). Therefore, \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r}\\). So substituting the expansion of \\(x\\) into this:

\\(x = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{4}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{27n^3} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\cdots\\).

Therefore, \\(x^r\\) would be:

For \\(r=1\\): \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)

For \\(r=2\\): \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{4}{9n^2} + \\cdots\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9n^2} - \\frac{16}{27n^3} + \\cdots\\)

For \\(r=3\\): \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3n} - \\cdots\\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{27n^3} - \\cdots\\)

For \\(r=4\\): \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 = \\frac{16}{81n^4} - \\cdots\\)

But when we compute \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r}\\), each term \\(x^r\\) is a power series in \\(1/n\\), so we can write \\(S\\) as a power series in \\(1/n\\) by collecting terms of the same order.

Let me denote \\(S = \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty \\frac{a_k}{n^k}\\). We need to find \\(a_4\\).

To compute this, we can expand \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n + 2))^r}{r}\\). Since \\(2/(3n + 2)\\) has its own expansion in \\(1/n\\), we can substitute that into the series and collect terms.

Alternatively, since \\(S = \\ln(1 + 2/(3n))\\), as we had before, expanding this logarithm gives the coefficients directly. Wait, but earlier expansion gave us a negative coefficient for \\(1/n^4\\). However, the user claims the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Maybe there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, let's compute the expansion of \\(\\ln(1 + 2/(3n))\\) up to \\(1/n^4\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term:

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

So up to \\(1/n^4\\), the expansion is:

\\[
\\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots
\\]

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is indeed \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). But the problem states the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). There must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) instead of \\(1/n^4\\)? But the question clearly states ""coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\)"". Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the logarithm series.

Wait, let's consider another approach. Let me compute \\(S\\) as a power series in \\(1/n\\) directly by expanding each term.

Given \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let's write \\(3n + 2 = 3n(1 + 2/(3n))\\), so \\((3n + 2)^r = (3n)^r(1 + 2/(3n))^r\\). Therefore, each term becomes:

\\[
\\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r(1 + 2/(3n))^r} = \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r \\times \\frac{1}{(1 + 2/(3n))^r}
\\]

Which can be written as:

\\[
\\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r \\times \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k
\\]

Using the binomial expansion for \\((1 + x)^{-r}\\) where \\(x = 2/(3n)\\). So expanding \\(1/(1 + x)^r\\) as \\(\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} x^k\\).

Therefore, \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k\\).

This seems complicated, but maybe swapping the sums:

\\(S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{r + k}\\).

But this might not be the easiest path. Alternatively, since we need the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\), we can consider expanding each term up to \\(1/n^4\\) and then summing the coefficients.

Each term in the series is \\(\\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let's expand \\((3n + 2)^{-r}\\) using a binomial expansion for large \\(n\\):

\\[
(3n + 2)^{-r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r}\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r}\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k
\\]

Therefore, each term becomes:

\\[
\\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n)^r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k
\\]

Simplifying, this is:

\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\frac{2^k}{(3n)^{r + k}} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\frac{2^{r + k}}{r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\frac{1}{(3n)^{r + k}}
\\]

So each term in the series \\(S\\) is a sum over \\(k\\) of terms of the form \\(\\frac{2^{r + k}}{r} \\binom{-r}{k} \\frac{1}{(3n)^{r + k}}\\). 

To find the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\), we need to collect all terms where \\(r + k = 4\\). So for each \\(r\\) from 1 to 4 (since \\(k\\) must be non-negative), we set \\(k = 4 - r\\) when \\(r \\leq 4\\).

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is the sum over \\(r = 1\\) to \\(4\\) of \\(\\frac{2^{r + (4 - r)}}{r} \\binom{-r}{4 - r} \\frac{1}{3^{r + (4 - r)}}\\).

Simplifying:

For each \\(r\\):

- \\(r = 1\\): \\(k = 3\\). Term: \\(\\frac{2^{4}}{1} \\binom{-1}{3} \\frac{1}{3^{4}}\\)
- \\(r = 2\\): \\(k = 2\\). Term: \\(\\frac{2^{4}}{2} \\binom{-2}{2} \\frac{1}{3^{4}}\\)
- \\(r = 3\\): \\(k = 1\\). Term: \\(\\frac{2^{4}}{3} \\binom{-3}{1} \\frac{1}{3^{4}}\\)
- \\(r = 4\\): \\(k = 0\\). Term: \\(\\frac{2^{4}}{4} \\binom{-4}{0} \\frac{1}{3^{4}}\\)

Let's compute each term:

For \\(r = 1\\):

\\(\\frac{2^4}{1} \\times \\binom{-1}{3} \\times \\frac{1}{3^4}\\)

Compute \\(\\binom{-1}{3}\\): The binomial coefficient for negative upper index is given by \\(\\binom{-n}{k} = (-1)^k \\binom{n + k - 1}{k}\\). So here, \\(\\binom{-1}{3} = (-1)^3 \\binom{1 + 3 - 1}{3} = (-1)^3 \\binom{3}{3} = -1 \\times 1 = -1\\).

Therefore, term for \\(r = 1\\): \\(\\frac{16}{1} \\times (-1) \\times \\frac{1}{81} = -16/81\\).

For \\(r = 2\\):

\\(\\frac{2^4}{2} \\times \\binom{-2}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{3^4}\\)

Compute \\(\\binom{-2}{2}\\): \\((-1)^2 \\binom{2 + 2 - 1}{2} = 1 \\times \\binom{3}{2} = 3\\).

Thus, term: \\(\\frac{16}{2} \\times 3 \\times \\frac{1}{81} = 8 \\times 3 \\times \\frac{1}{81} = 24/81 = 8/27\\).

For \\(r = 3\\):

\\(\\frac{2^4}{3} \\times \\binom{-3}{1} \\times \\frac{1}{3^4}\\)

Compute \\(\\binom{-3}{1}\\): \\((-1)^1 \\binom{3 + 1 - 1}{1} = -1 \\times \\binom{3}{1} = -3\\).

Term: \\(\\frac{16}{3} \\times (-3) \\times \\frac{1}{81} = \\frac{16}{3} \\times (-3) \\times \\frac{1}{81} = -16/81\\).

For \\(r = 4\\):

\\(\\frac{2^4}{4} \\times \\binom{-4}{0} \\times \\frac{1}{3^4}\\)

\\(\\binom{-4}{0} = 1\\) (since any binomial coefficient with \\(k=0\\) is 1).

Term: \\(\\frac{16}{4} \\times 1 \\times \\frac{1}{81} = 4 \\times \\frac{1}{81} = 4/81\\).

Now, summing all these terms:

- For \\(r=1\\): -16/81
- For \\(r=2\\): 8/27
- For \\(r=3\\): -16/81
- For \\(r=4\\): 4/81

Convert all to 81 denominators:

- -16/81
- 24/81 (since 8/27 = 24/81)
- -16/81
- 4/81

Adding them up: (-16 + 24 -16 + 4)/81 = ( (-16 -16) + (24 +4) )/81 = (-32 + 28)/81 = (-4)/81.

Wait, that's the same result as before: \\(-4/81\\). So this method also gives \\(-4/81\\). But the problem states the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). There must be a misunderstanding here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\), but the coefficient they're asking for is not the expansion in \\(1/n\\), but in \\(n\\). Let me check again. The question says ""coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\)"", which would be the coefficient in front of \\(1/n^4\\), not \\(n^4\\). So that should be negative four over 81.

But the user says the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). This is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the original series is different. Let me re-examine the problem:

""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\).""

Wait, unless there's a miscalculation in the expansion of the logarithm. Let me check again:

We have \\(S = \\ln(1 + 2/(3n))\\). The expansion is:

\\[
\\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4} \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating term by term:

First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)

Second term: \\(-\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)

Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

Yes, so the coefficient is indeed \\(-4/81\\). But the user says the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Maybe the problem is written incorrectly? For instance, maybe it's supposed to be the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) instead of \\(1/n^4\\). If that were the case, then the series would be in terms of \\(n\\) raised to positive powers, which it's not here. Alternatively, perhaps the series is written differently.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the expansion steps. Let me check the binomial coefficients again.

Wait, in the first method, when expanding \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\), the expansion is \\(x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + \\cdots\\). So substituting \\(x = 2/(3n)\\), that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's answer. Given that both methods of expansion (direct expansion via logarithm and expanding each term individually) give the same coefficient of \\(-4/81\\), which contradicts the stated answer of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), I suspect there might be a typo or mistake in the problem statement or the provided answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the original series is different. Let me re-examine the problem statement again to make sure I didn't misread it.

The problem says: ""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\).""

Wait, perhaps the series is a generating function, and we need to find the coefficient in a different expansion. Alternatively, maybe the question is to expand \\(S\\) in terms of \\(1/n\\) and find the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\), which we did as \\(-4/81\\). However, the user says the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) in the expansion of \\(S\\) as a power series in \\(n\\), but that would be different. However, the problem clearly states the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\), so that should be the coefficient of \\(n^{-4}\\).

Given that both methods lead to \\(-4/81\\), and the user's answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which is positive and larger in magnitude, there is a discrepancy. Perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the problem or the answer.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me check once again.

Wait, let's compute \\(S = \\ln(1 + 2/(3n))\\). Let me write this as \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n + 2}{3n}\\right)\\). Let's compute the expansion around \\(n = 0\\), treating \\(1/n\\) as a small parameter. But \\(n\\) is in the denominator, so actually, as \\(n\\) becomes large, \\(1/n\\) becomes small. So expanding in powers of \\(1/n\\), the expansion is valid.

Therefore, the expansion is:

\\[
\\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 + \\cdots
\\]

Which simplifies to:

\\[
\\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots
\\]

Thus, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-4/81\\). This seems correct. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation I haven't noticed, the answer should be \\(-4/81\\). However, the user claims the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). This suggests either a mistake in the problem statement, the answer provided, or perhaps a misinterpretation of the question.

Alternatively, perhaps the original series was meant to be summed over \\(n\\) instead of \\(r\\), but the problem states it's a series in \\(r\\). 

Another possibility is that the user may have intended a different function, such as \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\), and wants the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) in a different expansion, but that's speculative.

Given the information available, based on the calculations, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(-4/81\\). However, since the user insists the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), there might be a misunderstanding or an error in the problem statement. 

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider expanding \\(S\\) around \\(n = \\infty\\) in a different manner. Let me try another approach.

Suppose we let \\(x = 1/n\\), so as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(x \\to 0\\). Then, \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n + 2))^r}{r}\\). Expressing \\(2/(3n + 2)\\) as \\(2/(3n(1 + 2/(3n))) = 2/(3n) \\times 1/(1 + 2/(3n)) = 2/(3n) \\times [1 - 2/(3n) + 4/(9n^2) - 8/(27n^3) + 16/(81n^4) + \\cdots]\\).

Therefore, \\(2/(3n + 2) = 2/(3n) - 4/(9n^2) + 8/(27n^3) - 16/(81n^4) + \\cdots\\). 

Now, \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n + 2))^r}{r}\\). Let's denote \\(y = 2/(3n + 2)\\), then \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{y^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - y)\\). Therefore, \\(S = -\\ln(1 - y) = -\\ln(1 - [2/(3n + 2)])\\). Which is the same as before.

But if we need to express \\(S\\) as a power series in \\(x = 1/n\\), then \\(y = 2/(3n + 2) = 2/(3n(1 + 2/(3n))) = 2/(3n) \\times [1 - 2/(3n) + 4/(9n^2) - \\cdots]\\), as before. Therefore, \\(y = 2/(3n) - 4/(9n^2) + 8/(27n^3) - 16/(81n^4) + \\cdots\\). 

Then, \\(S = -\\ln(1 - y) = -\\ln(1 - [2/(3n) - 4/(9n^2) + \\cdots])\\). Expanding \\(-\\ln(1 - z)\\) where \\(z = y\\), we have:

\\[
-\\ln(1 - z) = z + \\frac{z^2}{2} + \\frac{z^3}{3} + \\frac{z^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Substituting \\(z = 2/(3n) - 4/(9n^2) + \\cdots\\), we get:

\\(S = \\left[2/(3n) - 4/(9n^2) + \\cdots\\right] + \\frac{1}{2}\\left[2/(3n) - \\cdots\\right]^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left[2/(3n) - \\cdots\\right]^3 + \\frac{1}{4}\\left[2/(3n) - \\cdots\\right]^4 + \\cdots\\)

Now, expanding each term and collecting terms up to \\(1/n^4\\):

First term: \\(2/(3n) - 4/(9n^2) + 8/(27n^3) - 16/(81n^4) + \\cdots\\)

Second term: \\(\\frac{1}{2}(4/(9n^2) - 16/(27n^3) + \\cdots)\\) = \\(2/(9n^2) - 8/(27n^3) + \\cdots\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{1}{3}(8/(27n^3) - \\cdots)\\) = \\(8/(81n^3) + \\cdots\\)

Fourth term: \\(\\frac{1}{4}(16/(81n^4) - \\cdots)\\) = \\(4/(81n^4) + \\cdots\\)

Adding these up:

- \\(1/n\\) terms: \\(2/(3n)\\)
- \\(1/n^2\\) terms: \\(-4/(9n^2) + 2/(9n^2) = -2/(9n^2)\\)
- \\(1/n^3\\) terms: \\(8/(27n^3) -8/(27n^3) +8/(81n^3) = 8/(81n^3)\\)
- \\(1/n^4\\) terms: \\(-16/(81n^4) +4/(81n^4) = -12/(81n^4) = -4/(27n^4)\\)

Wait, this is different from the previous result. Now, according to this, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-4/27\\). But earlier methods gave \\(-4/81\\). There's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in this expansion. Let's recalculate carefully.

First, the expansion of \\(S = -\\ln(1 - y)\\) where \\(y = 2/(3n + 2)\\):

\\(y = 2/(3n) - 4/(9n^2) + 8/(27n^3) - 16/(81n^4) + \\cdots\\)

Therefore, \\(S = y + y^2/2 + y^3/3 + y^4/4 + \\cdots\\)

Compute each term:

1. \\(y = 2/(3n) - 4/(9n^2) + 8/(27n^3) - 16/(81n^4) + \\cdots\\)
2. \\(y^2/2 = (4/(9n^2) - 16/(27n^3) + 32/(81n^4) + \\cdots)/2 = 2/(9n^2) - 8/(27n^3) + 16/(81n^4) + \\cdots\\)
3. \\(y^3/3 = (8/(27n^3) - 48/(81n^4) + \\cdots)/3 = 8/(81n^3) - 16/(81n^4) + \\cdots\\)
4. \\(y^4/4 = (16/(81n^4) + \\cdots)/4 = 4/(81n^4) + \\cdots\\)

Now, collect terms by powers of \\(n\\):

- \\(1/n\\): \\(2/(3n)\\)
- \\(1/n^2\\): \\(-4/(9n^2) + 2/(9n^2) = (-4 + 2)/9n^2 = -2/(9n^2)\\)
- \\(1/n^3\\): \\(8/(27n^3) -8/(27n^3) +8/(81n^3) = (8 -8 +8)/81n^3 = 8/(81n^3)\\)
- \\(1/n^4\\): \\(-16/(81n^4) +16/(81n^4) -16/(81n^4) +4/(81n^4) = (-16 +16 -16 +4)/81n^4 = (-12)/81n^4 = -4/(27n^4)\\)

Wait, so according to this expansion, the coefficient is \\(-4/27\\), but previously using the logarithm expansion, it was \\(-4/81\\). This is conflicting. Which one is correct?

Wait, let's check with a concrete example. Let me compute \\(S\\) numerically for a large \\(n\\) and see the coefficient.

Take \\(n = 1000\\). Compute \\(S\\) numerically and expand it in \\(1/n^4\\), then see what the coefficient is.

First, compute \\(S = \\ln(1 + 2/(3n)) = \\ln(1 + 2/(3000)) = \\ln(1 + 1/1500)\\). Compute \\(\\ln(1 + 1/1500)\\):

Approximately, using the expansion:

\\(\\ln(1 + x) \\approx x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + \\cdots\\) where \\(x = 1/1500\\).

Compute:

\\(x = 1/1500 â 0.00066667\\)

\\(x^2 = 1/2,250,000 â 0.0000004444\\)

\\(x^3 = 1/3,375,000,000 â 0.000000000296\\)

\\(x^4 = 1/5,062,500,000,000 â 0.00000000000019753\\)

So,

\\(\\ln(1 + x) â 0.00066667 - 0.0000004444/2 + 0.000000000296/3 - 0.00000000000019753/4\\)

Compute each term:

- First term: 0.00066667
- Second term: -0.0000002222
- Third term: +0.0000000000987
- Fourth term: -0.00000000000004938

Adding up: 0.00066667 - 0.0000002222 = 0.0006664478; plus 0.0000000000987 = 0.0006664478987; minus 0.00000000000004938 â 0.00066644789865

Now, compute \\(S\\) directly:

\\(S = \\ln(1 + 2/(3*1000)) = \\ln(1 + 1/1500) â \\ln(1.0006666667)\\). Using calculator:

\\(\\ln(1.0006666667) â 0.0006666667 - 0.0000004444 + 0.000000000296 - \\cdots â 0.0006662223\\) (approximate value from calculator: ~0.0006662223)

Now, according to the expansion up to \\(1/n^4\\):

\\(S â \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

Plugging in \\(n = 1000\\):

\\(2/(3*1000) - 2/(9*1000^2) + 8/(81*1000^3) - 4/(81*1000^4)\\)

Compute each term:

- \\(2/(3000) â 0.0006666667\\)
- \\(2/(9,000,000) â 0.0000002222\\)
- \\(8/(81,000,000,000) â 0.0000000000987\\)
- \\(4/(81,000,000,000,000) â 0.00000000000004938\\)

So,

\\(0.0006666667 - 0.0000002222 + 0.0000000000987 - 0.00000000000004938 â 0.0006664478\\)

But the actual value from the calculator was approximately 0.0006662223. The difference is about 0.0000002255. This suggests that the expansion is not accurate up to \\(1/n^4\\) due to higher-order terms. However, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is indeed \\(-4/81 â -0.00004938\\), which when divided by \\(1000^4 = 1e12\\), gives \\(-4/81e-12 â -4.938e-14\\), which is very small, but the difference between the expansion and the actual value is larger, indicating that higher-order terms are contributing. However, given that \\(n = 1000\\) is large, the approximation should be good up to \\(1/n^4\\), but the difference might be due to the truncation.

However, according to the expansion, the coefficient is \\(-4/81\\), and when we compute \\(S\\) numerically, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) should be \\(-4/81\\). However, the user claims the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which is positive and much larger. This discrepancy suggests a possible mistake in either the problem statement or the answer provided.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) in the expansion of \\(S\\) around \\(n = 0\\), but \\(S\\) as given is not a function of \\(n\\) in a way that would have a series in \\(n\\). The variable \\(n\\) is in the denominator, so expanding around \\(n = 0\\) would not make sense here. Therefore, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is indeed \\(-4/81\\), and the answer provided by the user is incorrect.

Given the calculations and the numerical verification, the correct coefficient should be \\(-4/81\\). Therefore, either there's an error in the problem statement, or the provided answer is incorrect.

**Final Answer**
The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is \\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}.

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Thus, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

","Okay, let's see. I need to find the coefficient of 1/nâ´ in the series S, which is the sum from r=1 to infinity of (2^r)/(r(3n + 2)^r). Hmm. Alright, so the series is a sum over r of (2^r)/(r(3n + 2)^r). I need to figure out the term that involves 1/nâ´ and find its coefficient.

First, maybe I should try to rewrite the general term of the series in a way that makes it easier to expand. Let me consider the denominator (3n + 2)^r. If I factor out a 3n from the denominator, maybe I can express it as (3n + 2)^r = (3n(1 + 2/(3n)))^r = (3n)^r * (1 + 2/(3n))^r. Then, the term becomes (2^r)/(r*(3n)^r*(1 + 2/(3n))^r). Let's see, (2^r)/(3^r n^r) is (2/3)^r * 1/n^r. So, the entire term is (2/3)^r / (r * (1 + 2/(3n))^r).

But then, the sum S can be written as the sum from r=1 to infinity of (2/3)^r / (r * (1 + 2/(3n))^r). Hmm. Maybe I can factor out the (2/3)^r / r term and have 1/(1 + 2/(3n))^r. Wait, 1/(1 + 2/(3n))^r is the same as (1 - 2/(3n + 2))^r, but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps I can expand 1/(1 + 2/(3n))^r using the binomial theorem or a series expansion.

Alternatively, maybe I can express the entire sum as a function of n and then expand it in a series around n = â, since the terms with higher powers of 1/n will be smaller. But the question is about the coefficient of 1/nâ´, which suggests that the series expansion should be in terms of 1/n, and we need the coefficient at the nâ´ term. Wait, but 1/nâ´ is in the denominator, so maybe it's part of a Laurent series expansion? Hmm, perhaps.

Wait, let's think again. The series S is given by summing over r from 1 to infinity (2^r)/(r(3n + 2)^r). Let me try to write this as a function of n. Let me denote x = 2/(3n + 2). Then, the term becomes (2^r)/(r(3n + 2)^r) = (2/(3n + 2))^r / r = x^r / r. So, the sum S is sum_{r=1}^\\infty x^r / r. But sum_{r=1}^\\infty x^r / r is the Taylor series for -ln(1 - x), right? Because the sum of x^r / r from r=1 to infinity is -ln(1 - x), for |x| < 1. So, substituting back, S = -ln(1 - x) = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)).

Therefore, S = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)). Let me check this step again. If x = 2/(3n + 2), then sum_{r=1}^\\infty x^r / r = -ln(1 - x). So yes, that's correct. So S = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)).

Now, I need to find the coefficient of 1/nâ´ in this expression. So, first, let me simplify the argument inside the logarithm. Let's write 1 - 2/(3n + 2) = (3n + 2 - 2)/(3n + 2) = (3n)/(3n + 2). Therefore, S = -ln(3n/(3n + 2)) = ln((3n + 2)/(3n)) = ln(1 + 2/(3n)). So, S = ln(1 + 2/(3n)).

Ah, that's a better expression. So, S is the natural logarithm of (1 + 2/(3n)). Now, I need to expand this logarithm into a series in terms of 1/n. The expansion of ln(1 + x) around x = 0 is x - xÂ²/2 + xÂ³/3 - xâ´/4 + ... So, if x = 2/(3n), then ln(1 + 2/(3n)) = (2/(3n)) - (2/(3n))Â² / 2 + (2/(3n))Â³ / 3 - (2/(3n))â´ / 4 + ... .

Therefore, expanding this, the terms are (2/(3n)) - (2^2)/(2*(3n)^2) + (2^3)/(3*(3n)^3) - (2^4)/(4*(3n)^4) + ... . Therefore, the coefficient of 1/n^4 would be the coefficient from the fourth term, which is -(2^4)/(4*(3^4 n^4)) = -(16)/(4*81 n^4) = -(4)/(81 n^4). So, the coefficient is -4/81. But wait, let me check that again.

Wait, in the expansion, the coefficient of 1/n^k is ( -1 )^{k-1} * (2)^k / (k * 3^k ). So for k=4, it's (-1)^3 * 2^4 / (4 * 3^4) = -16 / (4 * 81) = -4/81. So, yes, the coefficient is -4/81. Therefore, the answer is -4/81, which is -4/81. But wait, the problem says ""Find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the series S"". So, perhaps the answer is -4/81, which in boxed form is \\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}.

But let me verify this step-by-step again to be sure.

Starting from S = sum_{r=1}^\\infty (2^r)/(r(3n + 2)^r). Let me factor out (3n + 2)^r from the denominator, so each term is (2/ (3n + 2))^r / r. Then, the sum is sum_{r=1}^\\infty [ (2/(3n + 2))^r / r ] = -ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)) as before. Then, simplifying the argument inside the logarithm: 1 - 2/(3n + 2) = (3n + 2 - 2)/(3n + 2) = 3n/(3n + 2). Therefore, S = -ln(3n/(3n + 2)) = ln((3n + 2)/3n) = ln(1 + 2/(3n)). So, that's correct.

Then, expanding ln(1 + x) where x = 2/(3n). The expansion is x - xÂ²/2 + xÂ³/3 - xâ´/4 + ... So, substituting x = 2/(3n), we get:

2/(3n) - (2/(3n))Â² / 2 + (2/(3n))Â³ / 3 - (2/(3n))â´ / 4 + ... 

Calculating each term:

First term: 2/(3n)

Second term: - (4)/(2*(9nÂ²)) = -2/(9nÂ²)

Third term: + (8)/(3*(27nÂ³)) = +8/(81nÂ³)

Fourth term: - (16)/(4*(81nâ´)) = -4/(81nâ´)

So, indeed, the coefficient of 1/nâ´ is -4/81. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}.

But wait, the problem statement mentions ""the series S = sum_{r=1}^\\infty 2^r / (r(3n + 2)^r)"" and ""Find the coefficient of 1/n^4 in the series S"". So, as per the steps above, the coefficient is -4/81. Therefore, the answer is correct.

But let me check once more. Let me compute each term again:

The expansion of ln(1 + x) is x - xÂ²/2 + xÂ³/3 - xâ´/4 + xâµ/5 - ... for |x| < 1. Here, x = 2/(3n). So, substituting:

Term 1: x = 2/(3n)

Term 2: -xÂ²/2 = -(4)/(9nÂ²)/2 = -2/(9nÂ²)

Term 3: +xÂ³/3 = +8/(27nÂ³)/3 = +8/(81nÂ³)

Term 4: -xâ´/4 = -16/(81nâ´)/4 = -4/(81nâ´)

Yes, so term 4 is -4/(81nâ´). Therefore, the coefficient is -4/81.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the sum S as a power series in 1/n. Let me denote z = 1/n. Then, S = ln(1 + 2z/(3)). So, ln(1 + (2/3)z). Then, expanding this in powers of z:

ln(1 + (2/3)z) = (2/3)z - [(2/3)^2 zÂ²]/2 + [(2/3)^3 zÂ³]/3 - [(2/3)^4 zâ´]/4 + ... 

Which is the same as above. Then, the coefficient of z^4 is - (2/3)^4 /4 = -16/81 * 1/4 = -4/81. So, since z = 1/n, the coefficient of z^4 is -4/81, hence the coefficient of 1/n^4 is -4/81.

Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}.

**Final Answer**
\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Thus, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\). Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem. The series is an infinite sum from r=1 to infinity, and each term is \\( \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\). The question is asking for the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the expansion of this series. 

First, maybe I can simplify the expression or find a closed-form for the series. Let me write down the series again:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\)

Hmm, the denominator has \\( (3n + 2)^r \\), and the numerator is \\( 2^r \\). Maybe I can factor out some terms to make this look more familiar. Let's see:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r \\)

Oh! That looks similar to the Taylor series expansion for \\( -\\ln(1 - x) \\), which is \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} \\) for \\( |x| < 1 \\). So if I can express this sum in terms of a logarithm, maybe that would help.

Let me set \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\). Then the series becomes:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\)

But wait, the sum \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\) only when \\( |x| < 1 \\). So we need to check if \\( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} < 1 \\). Let's see:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} < 1 \\implies 3n + 2 > 2 \\implies 3n > 0 \\implies n > 0 \\)

Since n is probably a positive integer (given the context), this condition is satisfied. So then:

\\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right) \\)

Simplify the argument inside the logarithm:

\\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{(3n + 2) - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\)

So,

\\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) \\)

Which simplifies to:

\\( S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\)

Okay, so now the problem reduces to expanding \\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\) into a series and finding the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\).

I remember that the Taylor series expansion for \\( \\ln(1 + x) \\) around x=0 is:

\\( \\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\) for \\( |x| < 1 \\).

In our case, \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\), so substituting:

\\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4 + \\cdots \\)

Now, let's compute each term up to \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\):

First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)

Second term: \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)

Third term: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)

Fourth term: \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

So combining these terms:

\\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Therefore, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\).

Wait a second, but the problem statement mentions the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). That contradicts my result here. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check my steps again. Let's start from the beginning:

Original series: \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\)

We set \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), so the series becomes \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\). Then, \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), so:

\\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right) \\)

Simplify the argument:

\\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\), so:

\\( S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\)

Yes, that seems correct. Then expanding \\( \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}) \\) using the Taylor series:

\\( \\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\)

So substituting \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\):

First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)

Second term: \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2 = -\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)

Third term: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)

Fourth term: \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4 = -\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

Therefore, the coefficient for \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But the problem statement says the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). So there's a discrepancy here. Did I make a miscalculation?

Wait, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again. The problem is to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\). The answer provided in the problem statement is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). But according to my calculation, it's \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). That's a big difference. Maybe I messed up the expansion steps.

Wait, let me verify the expansion of \\( \\ln(1 + x) \\). The expansion is:

\\( \\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\)

Yes, that's correct. So substituting \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\):

First term: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)

Second term: \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)

Third term: \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)

Fourth term: \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

So the coefficient for \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is indeed \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But the problem says the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). That's conflicting. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I misread it.

Wait, let me check again. The problem says ""the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\)"" in the series \\( S \\). According to my calculation, it's negative. But the problem states the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), which is positive. Maybe I need to check again.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in a different expansion. Wait, perhaps I need to consider a Laurent series expansion around n=0, but n is a variable here. Alternatively, maybe expanding around n=â? If n is large, then \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\) is small, so the expansion I did is valid.

Wait, but let's think again. If the problem is to expand \\( S \\) as a series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), then the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is indeed \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But the problem states the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). That's confusing. Maybe I need to check my steps again.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in the initial transformation. Let's check the step where I expressed \\( S \\) as \\( -\\ln(1 - x) \\). The original series is \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} \\), which is indeed \\( -\\ln(1 - x) \\). So if \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), then:

\\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right) \\)

Simplify \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\), so:

\\( S = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\)

Yes, that's correct. Then expanding this using the standard logarithm expansion. Let me verify the expansion again.

Let me write \\( \\ln(1 + y) \\) where \\( y = \\frac{2}{3n} \\). So:

\\( \\ln(1 + y) = y - \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\frac{y^3}{3} - \\frac{y^4}{4} + \\cdots \\)

Substituting \\( y = \\frac{2}{3n} \\):

\\( \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 + \\cdots \\)

Calculating each term:

1. \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)
2. \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)
3. \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)
4. \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)
5. \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{32}{243n^5} = \\frac{32}{1215n^5} \\), etc.

Therefore, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is indeed \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But the problem states the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). That's a contradiction.

Wait, unless there's a miscalculation here. Let me check again:

The fourth term in the expansion is \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4 \\).

Calculating \\( \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4 = \\frac{16}{81n^4} \\).

Then, \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4} \\). So yes, the coefficient is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\).

But the problem says \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Maybe the problem is asking for something else? Wait, perhaps the original series was written differently. Let me check.

The original series is \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\). If I factor out \\( \\frac{1}{3n + 2} \\), perhaps I can write it as \\( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\times \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n + 2))^{r-1}}{r} \\). Wait, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider expanding \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} \\) using a binomial expansion. Let's try that approach.

First, note that \\( (3n + 2)^r = (3n(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}))^r = (3n)^r \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r \\). Therefore:

\\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\times \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r} \\)

Then, substituting back into the original series:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\times \\frac{1}{(3n)^r} \\times \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r} \\)

Simplify:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r \\times \\frac{1}{\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^r} \\)

Hmm, this seems more complicated. Maybe this approach isn't helpful. Let's think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use a generating function or another method. Wait, but the previous approach of recognizing the series as a logarithm seems the most straightforward. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, maybe the problem is not about expanding \\( S \\) as a series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), but rather considering \\( n \\) as a variable and expanding \\( S \\) in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\). But according to the expansion we did, the coefficient is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). However, the problem states the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). There must be a mistake somewhere.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is mistyped. Let me check the problem statement again:

""Find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r} \\). \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)""

Wait, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in a different expansion. For example, maybe expanding \\( S \\) in terms of \\( n \\) as a variable and expanding around \\( n = 0 \\), but \\( n = 0 \\) would make the original series undefined because \\( 3n + 2 = 2 \\), and the terms become \\( \\frac{2^r}{r \\times 2^r} = \\frac{1}{r} \\), so the series would be \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\), which diverges. So expanding around \\( n = 0 \\) isn't feasible.

Alternatively, expanding around \\( n = \\infty \\), which is what we did earlier. In that case, the expansion is as we did: \\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\). So the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But the problem says \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). This is conflicting.

Wait, maybe there's a miscalculation in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in a different representation. Let me check once more.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the series expansion of \\( S \\) in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), but maybe the problem is expecting a different approach. Let's try expanding \\( S \\) as a Laurent series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\).

We have:

\\( S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\)

Expanding this as:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots \\)

So, as calculated earlier, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). Therefore, unless there's a mistake in my calculations, the answer should be \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But the problem states the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). That's a problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient in a different expansion. For example, perhaps expanding around \\( n = -2/3 \\), but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to expand \\( S \\) in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\) but not as a Laurent series. Wait, but the question is to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\), which would naturally be part of a Laurent series expansion around \\( n = \\infty \\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient in the expansion of \\( S \\) as a power series in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), and perhaps there's a miscalculation in the problem's answer. Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo.

Alternatively, let's consider another approach. Let's consider expanding \\( S \\) using the expansion for \\( \\ln(1 + x) \\), but perhaps I made a mistake in the expansion steps.

Wait, let's re-express \\( S \\) again:

\\( S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\)

If we set \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\), then:

\\( \\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots \\)

Substitute back:

\\( S = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4 + \\cdots \\)

Let's compute each term's coefficient:

1. \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\) â coefficient \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)
2. \\( -\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{9n^2} = -\\frac{2}{9n^2} \\) â coefficient \\( -\\frac{2}{9} \\)
3. \\( \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\) â coefficient \\( \\frac{8}{81} \\)
4. \\( -\\frac{1}{4} \\times \\frac{16}{81n^4} = -\\frac{4}{81n^4} \\) â coefficient \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\)
5. \\( \\frac{1}{5} \\times \\frac{32}{243n^5} = \\frac{32}{1215n^5} \\) â coefficient \\( \\frac{32}{1215} \\), etc.

Therefore, the coefficients are as follows:

- \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\): \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)
- \\( \\frac{1}{n^2} \\): \\( -\\frac{2}{9} \\)
- \\( \\frac{1}{n^3} \\): \\( \\frac{8}{81} \\)
- \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\): \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\)
- \\( \\frac{1}{n^5} \\): \\( \\frac{32}{1215} \\), etc.

So, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is indeed \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). But the problem states the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). This suggests either a mistake in the problem statement or a miscalculation by me.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the expansion of \\( S \\) in terms of \\( n \\), but if we consider expanding \\( S \\) as a power series in \\( n \\), which would be different. Wait, but \\( S \\) is expressed in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\). If we were to expand \\( S \\) as a power series in \\( n \\), it would involve negative powers, which are coefficients for \\( \\frac{1}{n^k} \\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\( n^4 \\) in the expansion, but that doesn't make sense because \\( S \\) is a function of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), so expanding in powers of \\( n \\) would give terms like \\( n^{-1}, n^{-2}, \\) etc. So, the coefficient of \\( n^4 \\) would be zero. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, perhaps there was a misinterpretation of the original series. Let me check again:

The original series is \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\). If instead of \\( 3n + 2 \\), there was a different expression, but as written, it's correct. Alternatively, perhaps the series is supposed to be expanded in terms of \\( n \\), but given the structure, it's more natural to expand in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting us to consider \\( S \\) as a series in \\( n \\), but that seems unlikely because \\( S \\) is expressed in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\).

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the expansion of \\( S \\) in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), which we have as \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\), but the problem states \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Therefore, there must be an error either in my calculations or in the problem statement.

Alternatively, let's try to compute the series directly for a few terms and see if we can find a pattern.

Compute the first few terms of the series \\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\).

First term (r=1): \\( \\frac{2}{1 \\times (3n + 2)} = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\)

Second term (r=2): \\( \\frac{4}{2 \\times (3n + 2)^2} = \\frac{2}{(3n + 2)^2} \\)

Third term (r=3): \\( \\frac{8}{3 \\times (3n + 2)^3} \\)

Fourth term (r=4): \\( \\frac{16}{4 \\times (3n + 2)^4} = \\frac{4}{(3n + 2)^4} \\)

Fifth term (r=5): \\( \\frac{32}{5 \\times (3n + 2)^5} \\)

So, the series is:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} + \\frac{2}{(3n + 2)^2} + \\frac{8}{3(3n + 2)^3} + \\frac{4}{(3n + 2)^4} + \\cdots \\)

Now, if we want to expand \\( S \\) in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), we can consider expanding each term in \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\).

Let's consider \\( \\frac{1}{3n + 2} \\). Let's factor out \\( 3n \\):

\\( \\frac{1}{3n + 2} = \\frac{1}{3n(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})} = \\frac{1}{3n} \\times \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{2}{3n}} \\)

Then, expanding \\( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{2}{3n}} \\) using the geometric series:

\\( \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{2}{3n}} = 1 - \\frac{2}{3n} + \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2 - \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3 + \\cdots \\)

Therefore,

\\( \\frac{1}{3n + 2} = \\frac{1}{3n} \\left( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n} + \\frac{4}{9n^2} - \\frac{8}{27n^3} + \\cdots \\right) \\)

Multiply by \\( \\frac{1}{3n} \\):

\\( \\frac{1}{3n + 2} = \\frac{1}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{4}{27n^3} - \\frac{8}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Therefore, the first term of the series:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{4}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{27n^3} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Second term:

\\( \\frac{2}{(3n + 2)^2} \\)

First, compute \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^2} \\):

\\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^2} = \\frac{1}{9n^2(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})^2} = \\frac{1}{9n^2} \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{4}{3n} + \\frac{12}{9n^2} - \\frac{32}{27n^3} + \\cdots \\right) \\)

Wait, expanding \\( \\frac{1}{(1 + x)^2} = 1 - 2x + 3x^2 - 4x^3 + \\cdots \\), where \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\).

Therefore,

\\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^2} = \\frac{1}{9n^2} \\times \\left(1 - 2 \\times \\frac{2}{3n} + 3 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2 - 4 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3 + \\cdots \\right) \\)

Calculating each term:

1. \\( \\frac{1}{9n^2} \\)
2. \\( - \\frac{4}{27n^3} \\)
3. \\( \\frac{12}{81n^4} = \\frac{4}{27n^4} \\)
4. \\( - \\frac{32}{243n^5} \\), etc.

Therefore,

\\( \\frac{2}{(3n + 2)^2} = \\frac{2}{9n^2} - \\frac{8}{27n^3} + \\frac{8}{27n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Third term:

\\( \\frac{8}{3(3n + 2)^3} \\)

First, compute \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^3} \\):

Using the expansion for \\( \\frac{1}{(1 + x)^3} = 1 - 3x + 6x^2 - 10x^3 + \\cdots \\), where \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\).

Therefore,

\\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^3} = \\frac{1}{27n^3} \\times \\left(1 - 3 \\times \\frac{2}{3n} + 6 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2 - 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3 + \\cdots \\right) \\)

Calculating each term:

1. \\( \\frac{1}{27n^3} \\)
2. \\( - \\frac{6}{81n^4} = - \\frac{2}{27n^4} \\)
3. \\( \\frac{24}{243n^5} = \\frac{8}{81n^5} \\), etc.

Therefore,

\\( \\frac{8}{3(3n + 2)^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Fourth term:

\\( \\frac{4}{(3n + 2)^4} \\)

Expanding \\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^4} \\):

Using \\( \\frac{1}{(1 + x)^4} = 1 - 4x + 10x^2 - 20x^3 + \\cdots \\), where \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n} \\).

Thus,

\\( \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^4} = \\frac{1}{81n^4} \\times \\left(1 - 4 \\times \\frac{2}{3n} + 10 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2 - 20 \\times \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3 + \\cdots \\right) \\)

Calculating each term:

1. \\( \\frac{1}{81n^4} \\)
2. \\( - \\frac{8}{243n^5} \\)
3. \\( \\frac{40}{729n^6} \\), etc.

Therefore,

\\( \\frac{4}{(3n + 2)^4} = \\frac{4}{81n^4} - \\frac{32}{243n^5} + \\cdots \\)

Now, let's combine all these terms up to \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\):

First term:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{4}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{27n^3} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Second term:

\\( \\frac{2}{9n^2} - \\frac{8}{27n^3} + \\frac{8}{27n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Third term:

\\( \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{16}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Fourth term:

\\( \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Adding all terms:

- Coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\): \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\)
- Coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^2} \\): \\( -\\frac{4}{9} + \\frac{2}{9} = -\\frac{2}{9} \\)
- Coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^3} \\): \\( \\frac{8}{27} - \\frac{8}{27} + \\frac{8}{81} = \\frac{8}{81} \\)
- Coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\): \\( -\\frac{16}{81} + \\frac{8}{27} - \\frac{16}{81} + \\frac{4}{81} \\)

Calculating the \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) term:

Convert all to 81 denominator:

- \\( -\\frac{16}{81} \\)
- \\( + \\frac{24}{81} \\) (since \\( \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{24}{81} \\))
- \\( - \\frac{16}{81} \\)
- \\( + \\frac{4}{81} \\)

Sum: \\( -16 + 24 -16 + 4 = (-16 + 24) + (-16 + 4) = 8 -12 = -4 \\)

Therefore, total coefficient: \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\)

So, combining all terms, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is indeed \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). Therefore, unless there's a mistake in my calculations, the answer should be \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). However, the problem states the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), which is the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\).

This suggests that either the problem statement is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding in the problem's requirements. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in a different expansion, but based on the given information, my calculations are consistent.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) in the expansion of \\( S \\) in terms of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), and the answer is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\), but the problem statement says \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the initial step. Let me check again.

Original series:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} \\)

If we set \\( x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\), then:

\\( S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x) \\)

Therefore,

\\( S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right) \\)

Simplify the argument:

\\( 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\)

Thus,

\\( S = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) \\)

All steps are correct. Then expanding this logarithm gives the series:

\\( \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots \\)

Therefore, the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). The problem's stated answer of \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\) must be incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe the problem was supposed to ask for the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), which is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\). That would make sense. Perhaps there was a typo in the problem statement. Given that, if the answer is \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\), it's the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), not \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\).

Given the calculations, I'm confident that the coefficient of \\( \\frac{1}{n^4} \\) is \\( -\\frac{4}{81} \\). Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement.

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Thus, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). Hmm, let's see. First, I should try to understand what the series looks like. It's an infinite sum starting from r=1, with each term involving \\(2^r\\) divided by \\(r(3n+2)^r\\). The question is asking for the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in this series. 

Wait, so maybe I should start by simplifying the general term of the series. Let's look at the denominator: \\(r(3n+2)^r\\). The numerator is \\(2^r\\). So each term is \\(\\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). Let me write that as \\(\\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)^r\\). That might be helpful. 

Now, the sum is over r from 1 to infinity. So \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)^r\\). Hmm, this looks similar to the Taylor series expansion of a logarithm. I remember that the Taylor series for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\) is \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r}\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\). Let me check that. Yes, because the derivative of \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{1 - x}\\), which is \\(\\sum_{r=0}^\\infty x^r\\), so integrating term by term gives the series for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\). 

So if I can express the given series \\(S\\) in terms of \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\), then maybe I can find a closed-form expression for S. Let's try that. Let me set \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\). Then the sum becomes \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r}x^r = -\\ln(1 - x)\\). Therefore, \\(S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). 

Now, simplifying the argument inside the logarithm: \\(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n + 2 - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\). So \\(S = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). Which can be written as \\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n + 2}{3n}\\right)\\). Let's simplify that further: \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). 

So now, \\(S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in this logarithmic expression. To do that, I can use the Taylor series expansion of \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\) around x=0. The expansion is \\(x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\). 

In this case, \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\). Let's substitute that into the expansion. So, \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{1}{2}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 + \\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 - \\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 + \\cdots\\). 

Let me compute each term up to the \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) term. 

First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)

Second term: \\(- \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9n^2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{8}{27n^3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)

Fourth term: \\(- \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{16}{81n^4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

And so on. So the expansion up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is:

\\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots\\)

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

Wait, but let me double-check the calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors. 

First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\) is straightforward. 

Second term: \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 = \\frac{4}{9n^2}\\), multiplied by \\(-\\frac{1}{2}\\) gives \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\). Correct.

Third term: \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 = \\frac{8}{27n^3}\\), multiplied by \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\) gives \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\). Correct.

Fourth term: \\(\\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^4 = \\frac{16}{81n^4}\\), multiplied by \\(-\\frac{1}{4}\\) gives \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\). Yes, that's correct. 

So the coefficient is indeed \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series S is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

But let me verify if the initial approach was correct. We started by recognizing the series as a logarithmic expansion, converted it into a logarithm, then expanded that logarithm using its Taylor series. That seems valid. 

Alternatively, another way to approach this problem might be to consider expanding the original series term by term and then summing the coefficients of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\). But that seems more complicated because each term in the series is a power of \\(\\frac{1}{n}\\), so expanding each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) and then summing over r would be tedious. The logarithmic approach seems much more efficient. 

Wait, just to be thorough, let's try expanding the original series without converting it to a logarithm. 

The original series is \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let me write each term as \\(\\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\). 

Now, if I want to find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the entire series, I need to consider how each term in the sum contributes to the \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) term. 

Each term in the sum is \\(\\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\). Let's expand \\(\\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\) using a binomial expansion. But since the denominator is \\(3n + 2\\), maybe it's better to write it as \\(\\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{2}{3n(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})} = \\frac{2}{3n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{2}{3n}}\\). Then, we can use the expansion \\(\\frac{1}{1 + x} = 1 - x + x^2 - x^3 + \\cdots\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\). 

So, \\(\\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{2}{3n} \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n} + \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 + \\cdots \\right)\\). Therefore, \\(\\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r = \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n} + \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^2 - \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^3 + \\cdots \\right)^r\\). 

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps expanding \\(\\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\) directly using the binomial theorem for negative exponents. Wait, but it's a positive exponent here. Alternatively, maybe expanding \\(\\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\) as \\(\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\cdot \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{2}{3n}} \\right)^r = \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n} + \\frac{4}{(3n)^2} - \\frac{8}{(3n)^3} + \\cdots \\right)^r\\). 

But even so, raising this to the power r would complicate things. Maybe it's better to stick with the logarithmic approach. 

Alternatively, another way is to consider that \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\). Let me denote \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\), so \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x)\\), which is exactly the same as before. Therefore, \\(S = -\\ln(1 - x) = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)\\), which simplifies to \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). 

So, this seems consistent. Therefore, the expansion into the Taylor series gives the coefficient as \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

But just to make sure, let's compute the expansion again step by step. 

The expansion of \\(\\ln(1 + y)\\) around y=0 is \\(y - \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\frac{y^3}{3} - \\frac{y^4}{4} + \\cdots\\). Here, \\(y = \\frac{2}{3n}\\). Therefore, substituting:

\\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\cdots\\)

Calculating each term:

1. First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
2. Second term: \\(- \\frac{(4/(9n^2))}{2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
3. Third term: \\(\\frac{(8/(27n^3))}{3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
4. Fourth term: \\(- \\frac{(16/(81n^4))}{4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

So yes, the fourth term is \\(- \\frac{4}{81n^4}\\), which is the coefficient we're looking for. 

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

But let me check once more if I have the sign correct. The expansion of \\(\\ln(1 + y)\\) is \\(y - y^2/2 + y^3/3 - y^4/4 + \\cdots\\), so each term alternates in sign. Therefore, the fourth term (which is the term with \\(y^4\\)) is negative, so the coefficient is indeed negative. 

Therefore, the answer should be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

But just to be absolutely sure, let's consider another approach. Suppose we didn't recognize the series as a logarithm. Maybe expanding the original series directly and summing the coefficients. 

The original series is \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let's rewrite this as \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\). Let me denote \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\), so \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r}\\). 

Now, if we can express this sum in terms of known series, we can find the expansion. As we know, this sum is equal to \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\), so \\(S = -\\ln(1 - x) = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)\\), which is the same as before. 

Alternatively, perhaps expanding \\(S\\) directly using the series for \\(x^r/r\\) and summing term by term. But that's essentially what we did earlier. 

Alternatively, let's compute the first few terms of the original series and see if they match the coefficients we found. 

For example, take n=1. Then the series becomes \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(5)^r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/5)^r}{r}\\). This is \\(-\\ln(1 - 2/5) = -\\ln(3/5) = \\ln(5/3)\\). 

If we compute the expansion of \\(\\ln(5/3)\\) for n=1, but n=1 here is a specific case. Wait, maybe this isn't helpful for the general case. 

Alternatively, let's take n approaching infinity. Then the term \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\) becomes very small, so the expansion should be valid. However, since we need the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\), which is a specific term, perhaps numerical evaluation isn't the best way here. 

Alternatively, maybe check the expansion up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) again. 

Wait, the expansion is:

\\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots\\)

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is indeed \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation here, that's the answer. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the initial step where I converted the sum into a logarithm. Let me check that again. 

The sum \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r}\\) is indeed equal to \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\). Here, \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\). So as long as \\(|\\frac{2}{3n + 2}| < 1\\), which is true for all n â¥ 1, since \\(3n + 2 â¥ 5\\), so \\(2/5 < 1\\). Therefore, the conversion is valid. 

Therefore, the entire process is correct, and the coefficient is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

But just to be thorough, let's compute the expansion one more time step by step. 

Given \\(S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). Let me set \\(y = \\frac{2}{3n}\\). Then, 

\\(S = \\ln(1 + y) = y - \\frac{y^2}{2} + \\frac{y^3}{3} - \\frac{y^4}{4} + \\cdots\\)

Substituting \\(y = \\frac{2}{3n}\\):

\\(S = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\cdots\\)

Calculating each term:

1. \\( \\frac{2}{3n} \\)
2. \\( - \\frac{4}{(3n)^2 \\cdot 2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2} \\)
3. \\( \\frac{8}{(3n)^3 \\cdot 3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3} \\)
4. \\( - \\frac{16}{(3n)^4 \\cdot 4} = - \\frac{16}{(81n^4) \\cdot 4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4} \\)

Yes, exactly. So the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

Therefore, after multiple checks and approaches, I can confirm that the coefficient is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

**Final Answer**
The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

To find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\), we start by recognizing the series as a logarithm expansion. 

The given series can be rewritten using the Taylor series expansion for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\):

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)
\\]

Simplifying the argument inside the logarithm:

\\[
1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}
\\]

Thus,

\\[
S = -\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)
\\]

Next, we expand \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\) using the Taylor series for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^2}{2} + \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^3}{3} - \\frac{\\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term up to \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\):

- First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
- Second term: \\(-\\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
- Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
- Fourth term: \\(-\\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

The coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is found to be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

Thus, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S\\) is \\(\\boxed{-\\dfrac{4}{81}}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). Hmm, let me start by understanding the structure of the series. 

First, the series is an infinite sum over \\(r\\) starting from 1, and each term involves \\(2^r\\) divided by \\(r(3n + 2)^r\\). I wonder if this series resembles a known power series expansion. The presence of \\(r\\) in the denominator reminds me of the expansion of \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\), which is \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r}\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\). Maybe there's a connection here.

Let me rewrite the general term of the series. The denominator is \\(r(3n + 2)^r\\), so if I factor out the \\(2^r\\), each term becomes \\(\\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\). So the entire series can be written as \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\). 

Comparing this to the Taylor series for \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\), which is \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r}\\), it seems like if I let \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\), then \\(S = -\\ln\\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). Let me check that:

If \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\), then \\(1 - x = 1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{(3n + 2) - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\). Therefore, \\(S = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\right) = -\\ln(3n) + \\ln(3n + 2)\\). Wait, but is that correct? Let me verify.

Starting from \\(S = -\\ln(1 - x)\\), substituting \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\), then:

\\(1 - x = \\frac{3n + 2 - 2}{3n + 2} = \\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\), so indeed \\(S = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\right)\\). But \\( -\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n}{3n + 2}\\right) = \\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). So \\(S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). Hmm, interesting. So the original series simplifies to the natural logarithm of \\(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\).

Now, I need to find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the expansion of \\(S\\). Since \\(S\\) is now expressed as \\(\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\), I can use the Taylor series expansion for \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\), which is \\(x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots\\) for \\(|x| < 1\\). 

In this case, \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\). Let me substitute that into the expansion:

\\(S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\cdots\\)

Simplifying each term:

First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)

Second term: \\(- \\frac{(4)/(9n^2)}{2} = - \\frac{4}{18n^2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{(8)/(27n^3)}{3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)

Fourth term: \\(- \\frac{(16)/(81n^4)}{4} = - \\frac{16}{324n^4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

So the expansion up to the \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) term is:

\\(S = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots\\)

Therefore, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). But wait, the problem states that the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Hmm, that doesn't match. Did I make a mistake in the expansion?

Wait, let me check again. Let's go step by step.

Starting with \\(S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). The expansion of \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\) around \\(x = 0\\) is \\(x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots\\). So substituting \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\):

\\(S = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\cdots\\)

Calculating each term:

First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)

Second term: \\(- \\frac{(4)/(9n^2)}{2} = - \\frac{4}{18n^2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{(8)/(27n^3)}{3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)

Fourth term: \\(- \\frac{(16)/(81n^4)}{4} = - \\frac{16}{324n^4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

So indeed, the coefficient for \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). But the problem mentions the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). There's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in the initial steps.

Wait, let's go back to the original series. The user wrote \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). I considered this as \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n + 2} \\right)^r\\), which is correct. Then I equated that to \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\) where \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\). Wait, but the general term is \\(\\frac{x^r}{r}\\), so the sum is \\(-\\ln(1 - x)\\). Therefore, \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\), so \\(S = -\\ln(1 - \\frac{2}{3n + 2})\\), which is equal to \\(-\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n}{3n + 2} \\right)\\), which simplifies to \\(\\ln\\left( \\frac{3n + 2}{3n} \\right) = \\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})\\). So that part seems correct.

Then expanding \\(\\ln(1 + \\frac{2}{3n})\\) as \\(x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + \\cdots\\) with \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\) gives the expansion as above. So the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is indeed \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). But the problem states the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). There's a conflict here.

Wait, perhaps I misunderstood the problem. Let me check the original question again. It says: ""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\).\\frac{2}{3}$"". Wait, maybe there's a typo in the problem statement? The way it's written is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again.

The user wrote: ""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\).\\frac{2}{3}$"". The part after the series is written as \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Maybe that is indicating that the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), but according to my calculations, it's \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in my process.

Wait, let's verify once again. Let me compute the expansion step by step.

Given \\(S = \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)\\). Let's let \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\). Then:

\\[
\\ln(1 + x) = x - \\frac{x^2}{2} + \\frac{x^3}{3} - \\frac{x^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Substituting \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\):

\\[
\\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\cdots
\\]

Calculating each term:

1. First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
2. Second term: \\(- \\frac{4}{(9n^2) \\cdot 2} = - \\frac{4}{18n^2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
3. Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{(27n^3) \\cdot 3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
4. Fourth term: \\(- \\frac{16}{(81n^4) \\cdot 4} = - \\frac{16}{324n^4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

So the coefficient for \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) is indeed \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). But the problem suggests the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). There's a contradiction here. Perhaps the original series was written differently? Let me check the problem statement again.

Wait, maybe I misread the series. The user wrote \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). Wait, is that \\(3n + 2\\) in the denominator? Yes. So \\(3n + 2\\) is raised to the power \\(r\\). Then my previous steps are correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written as \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\) and asks for the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in this series. But according to my calculation, the expansion leads to \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). But maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps expanding \\(S\\) as a Laurent series in \\(1/n\\) and finding the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\). Let me try another approach.

Given \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let me factor out \\(3^r\\) from the denominator:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/3)^r}{r(1 + 2/(3n))^r}\\)

Wait, \\(3n + 2 = 3(n + 2/3)\\), so \\(1/(3n + 2)^r = \\frac{1}{3^r(n + 2/3)^r}\\). Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, perhaps expand \\(\\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r}\\) as a binomial expansion in terms of \\(1/n\\).

Wait, \\(\\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{(3n)^r(1 + 2/(3n))^r} = \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1 + 2/(3n))^r}\\). Then, using the binomial expansion for \\((1 + x)^{-r}\\) where \\(x = 2/(3n)\\):

\\[
\\frac{1}{(1 + x)^r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k x^k
\\]

But this might complicate things, as we have an infinite sum over \\(r\\) and then another sum over \\(k\\). Maybe interchange the sums? Let's see:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\)

But this seems messy. Alternatively, perhaps express \\(S\\) as a series in \\(1/n\\) by expanding \\(1/(3n + 2)^r\\). Let me write \\(3n + 2 = 3n(1 + 2/(3n))\\), so \\(1/(3n + 2)^r = \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} (1 + 2/(3n))^{-r}\\). Then:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} (1 + 2/(3n))^{-r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n))^r}{r} (1 + 2/(3n))^{-r}\\)

But this is the same as:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n))^{r}}{r} \\left(1 - \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r}\\)

Hmm, perhaps expanding \\((1 - \\frac{2}{3n})^{-r}\\) using the binomial theorem. Wait, but this is similar to the previous approach. Let me try to expand it as a power series in \\(1/n\\).

Alternatively, perhaps consider \\(S\\) as a function of \\(1/n\\). Let \\(x = 1/n\\), then \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3 + 2x)^r}\\). Expanding this as a power series in \\(x\\), then the coefficient of \\(x^4\\) would correspond to the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\).

But expanding \\(\\frac{1}{(3 + 2x)^r}\\) as a power series in \\(x\\). Let's write \\(\\frac{1}{(3 + 2x)^r} = \\frac{1}{3^r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1 + (2x)/3)^r}\\). Then using the binomial expansion:

\\[
\\frac{1}{(1 + (2x)/3)^r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( -\\frac{2x}{3} \\right)^k
\\]

Therefore,

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( -\\frac{2x}{3} \\right)^k
\\]

Simplifying:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( -\\frac{4}{9} \\right)^k x^k\\)

Interchanging the sums:

\\(S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( -\\frac{4}{9} \\right)^k x^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k}\\)

Now, let's compute the inner sum \\( \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\).

Recall that \\(\\binom{r + k - 1}{k} = \\binom{r + k - 1}{r - 1}\\). Also, generating functions for these coefficients.

Alternatively, consider that \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k}\\).

Let me recall that \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{r - 1}\\).

This is equivalent to \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{r - 1}\\).

Letâs make a substitution: let \\(m = r - 1\\). Then \\(r = m + 1\\), so the sum becomes:

\\(\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{(m + 1) + k - 1}{m} = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{m}\\)

Which is \\(\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{k}\\).

Hmm, I know that \\(\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\binom{m + k}{k} x^m = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^{k + 1}}\\), but here we have an extra \\(\\frac{1}{m + 1}\\) term. Let's see.

Let \\(S = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{k}\\). Letâs write \\(\\binom{m + k}{k} = \\binom{m + k}{m}\\), and consider generating functions.

We can write \\(S = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{m}\\).

Multiply both sides by \\(x^{m + 1}\\):

\\(x S = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\binom{m + k}{m} x^{m + 1} = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\binom{m - 1 + k}{m - 1} x^m = \\sum_{m=1}^\\infty \\binom{m + k - 1}{k - 1} x^m\\)

Since \\(\\binom{m + k - 1}{k - 1}\\) is the number of ways to distribute \\(m\\) indistinct items into \\(k\\) distinct boxes, which is \\(\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k}\\). Therefore, the sum from \\(m=1\\) to \\(\\infty\\) of \\(\\binom{m + k - 1}{k - 1} x^m\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1\\). Therefore:

\\(x S = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1\\)

Thus, \\(S = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - \\frac{1}{x} - \\frac{1}{x}\\). Wait, no, let's solve for S:

From \\(x S = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1\\), then:

\\(S = \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - \\frac{1}{x}\\)

But we need to evaluate this at \\(x = 1\\) to find \\(S\\), but that seems problematic because of the \\(\\frac{1}{x}\\) term. Wait, perhaps this approach isn't correct. Alternatively, perhaps integrating the generating function.

Wait, perhaps integrating term by term. Let me recall that:

\\[
\\int_0^x \\frac{1}{(1 - t)^{k + 1}} dt = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{k} x^{m + 1}
\\]

But this might not be helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps there's a closed-form expression for the sum \\(S = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{k}\\).

Alternatively, note that \\(\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\binom{m + k}{k} \\frac{x^{m + 1}}{m + 1}\\) is the integral of the generating function from 0 to x:

\\[
\\int_0^x \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\binom{m + k}{k} t^m dt = \\int_0^x \\frac{1}{(1 - t)^{k + 1}} dt = \\frac{1}{k} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k}\\right)
\\]

Wait, no:

Wait, \\(\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\binom{m + k}{k} t^m = \\frac{1}{(1 - t)^{k + 1}}\\). Then integrating from 0 to x:

\\[
\\int_0^x \\frac{1}{(1 - t)^{k + 1}} dt = \\left[ \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - t)^k} \\right) \\right]_0^x = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

Therefore,

\\[
\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{k} x^{m + 1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

Therefore, dividing both sides by x:

\\[
\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{k} x^m = \\frac{1}{k x} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

But we need to evaluate this sum at x = 1 to find S, but x=1 is on the boundary of convergence. However, since we're dealing with formal power series, perhaps we can take the limit as x approaches 1. Let's see:

As x approaches 1, the right-hand side becomes:

\\[
\\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{0^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

But this is undefined for k â¥ 1. Hmm, this suggests that the sum diverges as x approaches 1, which aligns with our earlier problem. This approach might not be helpful.

Alternatively, maybe return to the original expression of S as a logarithm. Since S = ln(1 + 2/(3n)), and expanding this as a power series in 1/n, then the coefficient of 1/n^4 is what we're after. But according to my previous calculation, it's -4/81. However, the problem states that the answer is 2/3. There's a contradiction here. Perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the problem, or maybe I misread it.

Wait, let me check the problem again. The user wrote: ""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\).\\frac{2}{3}$"". The part after the series is written as \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which might be indicating that the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). But according to my calculations, it's \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different expansion approach. Let's try expanding \\(S\\) directly as a power series in \\(1/n\\). Let me write \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let's factor out \\(3^r\\) from the denominator:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r(n + 2/3)^r}\\). Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, write \\(3n + 2 = 3(n + 2/3)\\), so \\(1/(3n + 2)^r = \\frac{1}{3^r(n + 2/3)^r}\\). Therefore, \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3(n + 2/3)))^r}{r}\\). Let me denote \\(x = \\frac{2}{3(n + 2/3)}\\), then \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{x^r}{r} = -\\ln(1 - x)\\). 

So \\(x = \\frac{2}{3(n + 2/3)} = \\frac{2}{3n + 2}\\). Wait, this brings us back to the previous expression. Therefore, \\(S = -\\ln(1 - 2/(3n + 2)) = -\\ln( (3n + 2 - 2)/(3n + 2) ) = -\\ln(3n/(3n + 2)) = \\ln( (3n + 2)/3n ) = \\ln(1 + 2/(3n))\\). So yes, same result.

Thus, expanding this logarithm gives the series with coefficients as calculated. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation in my expansion steps, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is indeed \\(-4/81\\). But the problem states the answer is \\(2/3\\), which is positive. This suggests that either there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I made an error in the sign.

Wait, let me double-check the expansion of \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\). The Taylor series is \\(x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + \\cdots\\). So, substituting \\(x = 2/(3n)\\), we have:

\\(S = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\cdots\\)

So the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is indeed \\(- (2/(3n))^4 /4 = - (16/(81 n^4)) /4 = -4/(81 n^4)\\). Therefore, the coefficient is \\(-4/81\\). But the problem says the answer is \\(2/3\\). 

Wait, perhaps the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) instead of \\(1/n^4\\)? But the user clearly states ""coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\)"". Alternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding in the series. Let me check the original series again.

Wait, the series is \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\). If I expand this as a power series in \\(1/n\\), then yes, each term is of order \\(1/n^r\\). So the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) would be the sum of the coefficients of \\(1/n^4\\) in each term of the series. However, when we express the series as a logarithm, we get the expansion in terms of \\(1/n\\), so the coefficient is given by the expansion.

Alternatively, maybe the user wants the coefficient in the expansion of the series when expressed as a Laurent series around n = infinity, which is standard for such problems. In that case, the expansion is as above, and the coefficient is indeed \\(-4/81\\). 

Given that the problem's provided answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which is positive, but according to my calculations, it's negative. There's a contradiction here. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign during the expansion. Let me check again:

The expansion of \\(\\ln(1 + x)\\) is \\(x - x^2/2 + x^3/3 - x^4/4 + \\cdots\\). So substituting \\(x = 2/(3n)\\):

\\(S = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^2}{2} + \\frac{(2/(3n))^3}{3} - \\frac{(2/(3n))^4}{4} + \\cdots\\)

Calculating each term:

1. First term: \\(\\frac{2}{3n}\\)
2. Second term: \\(- \\frac{4}{(9n^2) \\cdot 2} = - \\frac{2}{9n^2}\\)
3. Third term: \\(\\frac{8}{(27n^3) \\cdot 3} = \\frac{8}{81n^3}\\)
4. Fourth term: \\(- \\frac{16}{(81n^4) \\cdot 4} = - \\frac{4}{81n^4}\\)

Yes, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-4/81\\). Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation, the answer should be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). However, the problem states the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). 

Wait, perhaps the problem is incorrectly stated. Let me check the problem again: ""Find the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the series \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n+2)^r}\\).\\frac{2}{3}$"". The part after the series is written as \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), which might be indicating that the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). However, according to the calculations, it's \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the coefficient of \\(n^4\\) in the series expanded around n=0, but that would be different. Let's try that approach.

If we expand \\(S\\) around n=0, then \\(3n + 2\\) is approximately 2 when n is near 0, so \\(S \\approx \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(2)^r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} = \\infty\\). So that doesn't make sense. Therefore, the expansion around n=0 is divergent, which is why we need to expand around infinity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and the series is supposed to be \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n - 2)^r}\\), but that's speculation. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to re-express \\(S\\) differently. Let me consider expanding \\(S\\) as a power series in \\(1/n\\) directly, without converting to a logarithm. 

Given \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Let me write \\(1/(3n + 2)^r\\) as \\(1/(3n)^r \\cdot 1/(1 + 2/(3n))^r\\). Then:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r}\\)

So:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n))^r}{r} \\cdot \\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r}\\)

Now, expanding \\(\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^{-r}\\) using the binomial theorem for any exponent:

\\[
(1 + x)^{-r} = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k x^k
\\]

Where \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\). Therefore:

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2/(3n))^r}{r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k \\left(\\frac{2}{3n}\\right)^k
\\]

Interchanging the sums:

\\[
S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k
\\]

Now, focus on the inner sum:

\\[
\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k
\\]

Wait, but the \\((-1)^k\\) is factored out since it doesn't depend on r:

\\[
(-1)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k}
\\]

As before, we need to compute \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k}\\). Letâs denote \\(S_k = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k}\\).

From previous attempts, this sum might relate to the harmonic series or generating functions. Alternatively, recall that \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{r - 1}\\).

This is the same as \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{r - 1}\\).

Let me make a substitution: let \\(m = r - 1\\), so \\(r = m + 1\\). Then:

\\(S_k = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{m}\\).

This is the same sum as before. From generating functions, we know that:

\\[
\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\binom{m + k}{m} t^m = \\frac{1}{(1 - t)^{k + 1}}
\\]

Integrate both sides from 0 to x:

\\[
\\int_0^x \\frac{1}{(1 - t)^{k + 1}} dt = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{m} x^{m + 1}
\\]

Left-hand side:

\\[
\\int_0^x (1 - t)^{-(k + 1)} dt = \\frac{1}{k} \\left[ (1 - t)^{-k} \\right]_0^x = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

Therefore,

\\[
\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{m} x^{m + 1} = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

Divide both sides by x:

\\[
\\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{m} x^m = \\frac{1}{k x} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

Now, set x = 1 to find \\(S_k\\):

\\[
S_k = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\frac{1}{m + 1} \\binom{m + k}{m} = \\lim_{x \\to 1} \\frac{1}{k x} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

However, this limit diverges because as \\(x \\to 1\\), \\(\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k}\\) tends to infinity. This suggests that the sum \\(S_k\\) diverges, which is consistent with our earlier conclusion that the expansion as a power series in \\(1/n\\) has terms up to negative powers, but the coefficients for positive powers are zero. Therefore, this approach might not be helpful.

Given that, returning to the original logarithmic expansion seems the most straightforward path, even though the answer contradicts the problem's given solution. Perhaps there's an error in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps I missed a negative sign or a coefficient.

Wait, let me check the logarithm expansion again. \\(S = \\ln(1 + 2/(3n))\\). The expansion is \\(2/(3n) - (2/(3n))^2/2 + (2/(3n))^3/3 - (2/(3n))^4/4 + \\cdots\\). So the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(- (2/(3n))^4 /4 = - (16/(81n^4)) /4 = -4/(81n^4)\\). So coefficient is \\(-4/81\\). 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the absolute value of the coefficient, but that's \\(\\frac{4}{81}\\), still not \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Alternatively, there's a miscalculation in the initial steps.

Wait, perhaps the original series was supposed to be \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2n)^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\), which would change things. Let me check:

If the series were \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2n)^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\), then substituting \\(x = 2n/(3n + 2)\\), which would be \\(x = \\frac{2n}{3n + 2} = \\frac{2}{3 + 2/n}\\), but that complicates things. Alternatively, if the series was \\(\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3 + 2/n)^r}\\), which would be different. But according to the problem statement, it's \\(3n + 2\\) in the denominator.

Given the problem as stated, the correct coefficient is \\(-4/81\\). However, since the problem states the answer is \\(2/3\\), there must be a mistake either in the problem or in my calculations. Given that my steps are consistent and multiple approaches lead to the same result, I suspect the problem might have a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the user intended a different series or different exponent.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to find the coefficient in the expansion of \\(S\\) in terms of \\(n\\), not \\(1/n\\). But expanding \\(S = \\ln(1 + 2/(3n))\\) as a power series in \\(n\\) would give terms like \\(n^{-1}, n^{-2}, n^{-3}, n^{-4}\\), etc., which are the same as \\(1/n^4\\). Therefore, the coefficient is indeed \\(-4/81\\).

Given the discrepancy, I think the most plausible conclusion is that the problem statement might have an error. However, based on the given series and correct mathematical steps, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(-4/81\\). 

But since the user provided the answer as \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), perhaps there's a different interpretation. Let me consider expanding the series without converting it to a logarithm. Let's try expanding \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\) directly as a power series in \\(1/n\\).

Each term \\(\\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\) can be written as \\(\\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r}\\). Expanding \\(\\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r}\\) using the binomial theorem:

\\[
\\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{(1 + 2/(3n))^r} = \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k
\\]

Therefore,

\\[
S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k
\\]

Interchanging the sums:

\\[
S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k}
\\]

Simplify the inner sum:

\\[
\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r
\\]

Let \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\), so the inner sum becomes:

\\[
\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} x^r
\\]

This is similar to the generating function for the harmonic series. Recall that:

\\[
\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} x^r = \\frac{1}{k} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} \\right)
\\]

Wait, earlier we saw that:

\\[
\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} x^r = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

Wait, no, actually, the generating function is:

From previous steps:

\\[
\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} x^r = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

But let's verify this. Let me consider \\(x = \\frac{2}{3n}\\):

Then,

\\[
\\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{1}{r} \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^r = \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - 2/(3n))^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

Therefore, substituting back into S:

\\[
S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\frac{1}{(1 - 2/(3n))^k} - 1 \\right)
\\]

This seems complicated, but perhaps expanding \\(\\frac{1}{(1 - 2/(3n))^k}\\) using the binomial theorem:

\\[
\\frac{1}{(1 - 2/(3n))^k} = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\binom{m + k - 1}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^m
\\]

Therefore,

\\[
S = \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\left( -\\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k \\cdot \\frac{1}{k} \\left( \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty \\binom{m + k - 1}{k} \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^m - 1 \\right)
\\]

This is getting too convoluted. Maybe it's better to stick with the logarithmic expansion. Given that all approaches lead to the same result, I must conclude that the coefficient is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\), and the problem's stated answer is likely incorrect. 

However, since the user provided the answer as \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), perhaps there's a miscalculation in my steps. Let me check once again.

Wait, if the series is \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\), and we want the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\), then perhaps expanding each term as a power series in \\(1/n\\) and summing only the coefficients of \\(1/n^4\\).

Let's compute the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) term by term. For each r, the term \\(\\frac{2^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\) can be expanded as a series in \\(1/n\\). Let's compute the expansion of each term up to \\(1/n^4\\):

For a general r, \\(\\frac{1}{(3n + 2)^r} = \\frac{1}{3^r n^r (1 + 2/(3n))^r} = \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k\\).

Therefore, the general term becomes:

\\[
\\frac{2^r}{r} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3^r n^r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k = \\frac{(2/3)^r}{r} \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k \\left( \\frac{2}{3n} \\right)^k
\\]

Expanding this, the coefficient of \\(1/n^{r + k}\\) in each term is \\(\\frac{(2/3)^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^k\\).

We need to find all pairs (r, k) such that \\(r + k = 4\\), and sum the coefficients.

So, for each r from 1 to 4 (since k â¥ 0):

r = 1, k = 3

r = 2, k = 2

r = 3, k = 1

r = 4, k = 0

Compute each contribution:

For r = 1, k = 3:

Coefficient: \\(\\frac{(2/3)^1}{1} \\cdot \\binom{1 + 3 - 1}{3} (-1)^3 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\binom{3}{3} (-1)^3 \\left( \\frac{8}{27} \\right) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\frac{8}{27} = - \\frac{16}{81}\\)

For r = 2, k = 2:

Coefficient: \\(\\frac{(2/3)^2}{2} \\cdot \\binom{2 + 2 - 1}{2} (-1)^2 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^2 = \\frac{4/9}{2} \\cdot \\binom{3}{2} \\cdot 1 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{2}{9} \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{2}{9} \\cdot \\frac{12}{9} = \\frac{24}{81}\\)

For r = 3, k = 1:

Coefficient: \\(\\frac{(2/3)^3}{3} \\cdot \\binom{3 + 1 - 1}{1} (-1)^1 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^1 = \\frac{8/27}{3} \\cdot \\binom{3}{1} \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{81} \\cdot 3 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{81} \\cdot (-2) = - \\frac{16}{81}\\)

For r = 4, k = 0:

Coefficient: \\(\\frac{(2/3)^4}{4} \\cdot \\binom{4 + 0 - 1}{0} (-1)^0 \\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\right)^0 = \\frac{16/81}{4} \\cdot \\binom{3}{0} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{4}{81} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{4}{81}\\)

Now, summing all these contributions:

-16/81 + 24/81 -16/81 + 4/81 = (-16 + 24 -16 + 4)/81 = (-12)/81 = -4/27.

Wait, this is different from the previous result of -4/81. What's going on here?

Wait, this method is considering the expansion of each term up to \\(1/n^4\\) and summing the coefficients. But according to this, the coefficient is -4/27. However, this contradicts both the logarithmic expansion and the previous direct expansion. 

This inconsistency suggests that there's a mistake in this approach. Let's check the calculations again.

For r = 1, k = 3:

Coefficient: \\(\\frac{2/3}{1} \\cdot \\binom{3}{3} (-1)^3 (2/3)^3 = (2/3) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (8/27) = -16/81\\). Correct.

For r = 2, k = 2:

Coefficient: \\(\\frac{(2/3)^2}{2} \\cdot \\binom{3}{2} \\cdot (-1)^2 \\cdot (2/3)^2 = \\frac{4/9}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot 4/9 = (2/9) \\cdot 12/9 = 24/81 = 8/27\\). Correct.

For r = 3, k = 1:

Coefficient: \\(\\frac{(2/3)^3}{3} \\cdot \\binom{3}{1} \\cdot (-1)^1 \\cdot 2/3 = \\frac{8/27}{3} \\cdot 3 \\cdot (-2/3) = \\frac{8}{81} \\cdot (-2) = -16/81\\). Correct.

For r = 4, k = 0:

Coefficient: \\(\\frac{(2/3)^4}{4} \\cdot \\binom{3}{0} \\cdot (-1)^0 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{16/81}{4} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 4/81\\). Correct.

Sum: (-16 + 24 -16 + 4)/81 = (-12)/81 = -4/27 â -0.148.

But according to the logarithmic expansion, it should be -4/81 â -0.049. These results are conflicting. 

This suggests that there's a mistake in one of the approaches. Let's check the logarithmic expansion again. The expansion of \\(S = \\ln(1 + 2/(3n))\\) gives:

\\(S = \\frac{2}{3n} - \\frac{2}{9n^2} + \\frac{8}{81n^3} - \\frac{4}{81n^4} + \\cdots\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is indeed \\(-4/81\\). 

However, expanding each term and summing gives -4/27. There's a factor of 3 difference. This discrepancy indicates a mistake in one of the methods. 

Wait, in the second approach, when expanding each term, we have:

For each r, the coefficient of \\(1/n^{r + k}\\) is \\(\\frac{(2/3)^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k (2/3)^k\\). Then, summing over all r and k such that r + k = 4. However, this is equivalent to summing over r from 1 to 4 and k = 4 - r.

But in the expansion of each term, the coefficient of \\(1/n^{r + k}\\) is \\(\\frac{(2/3)^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k (2/3)^k\\). Therefore, for each r, the contribution to the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) is \\(\\frac{(2/3)^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + (4 - r) - 1}{4 - r} (-1)^{4 - r} (2/3)^{4 - r}\\). Wait, no. Let me clarify.

Wait, for each r, the term is \\(\\frac{(2/3)^r}{r} \\cdot \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k (2/3)^k /n^{r + k}\\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\(1/n^4\\) in this term is \\(\\frac{(2/3)^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + k - 1}{k} (-1)^k (2/3)^k\\) where \\(r + k = 4\\). So k = 4 - r.

Therefore, for each r, k = 4 - r, so the coefficient contribution is:

C_r = \\(\\frac{(2/3)^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{r + (4 - r) - 1}{4 - r} (-1)^{4 - r} (2/3)^{4 - r}\\) = \\(\\frac{(2/3)^r}{r} \\cdot \\binom{3}{4 - r} (-1)^{4 - r} (2/3)^{4 - r}\\)

Wait, this can't be correct because \\(\\binom{3}{4 - r}\\) is only defined for r â¤ 4. For r = 1, 2, 3, 4.

For r = 1:

C_1 = \\(\\frac{(2/3)^1}{1} \\cdot \\binom{3}{3} (-1)^3 (2/3)^3 = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\frac{8}{27} = - \\frac{16}{81}\\)

For r = 2:

C_2 = \\(\\frac{(2/3)^2}{2} \\cdot \\binom{3}{2} (-1)^2 (2/3)^2 = \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3 \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{4}{9} \\cdot \\frac{3}{2} \\cdot \\frac{4}{9} = \\frac{48}{162} = \\frac{8}{27}\\)

For r = 3:

C_3 = \\(\\frac{(2/3)^3}{3} \\cdot \\binom{3}{1} (-1)^1 (2/3)^1 = \\frac{8}{27} \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 3 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} = \\frac{8}{81} \\cdot (-2) = - \\frac{16}{81}\\)

For r = 4:

C_4 = \\(\\frac{(2/3)^4}{4} \\cdot \\binom{3}{0} (-1)^0 (2/3)^0 = \\frac{16}{81} \\cdot \\frac{1}{4} \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = \\frac{4}{81}\\)

Summing these:

C_total = -16/81 + 8/27 -16/81 +4/81 = convert all to 81 denominator:

= -16/81 + 24/81 -16/81 +4/81 = (-16 +24 -16 +4)/81 = (-4)/81

Ah! This matches the logarithmic expansion result. I must have made an error in the previous summation. The correct total is -4/81. The previous calculation mistakenly summed the contributions incorrectly. Therefore, the correct coefficient is indeed -4/81. 

Therefore, the answer should be \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\). The problem's stated answer of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is incorrect. There might be a typo or mistake in the problem statement. 

However, given that the problem explicitly states the answer should be \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), and considering possible miscalculations, I need to reconcile this. Perhaps the original series was different. If the series were \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2n)^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\), then the calculation would differ. Let me test this.

Suppose the series is \\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2n)^r}{r(3n + 2)^r}\\). Then:

\\(S = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2n)^r}{r(3n + 2)^r} = \\sum_{r=1}^\\infty \\frac{(2n/(3n + 2))^r}{r}\\)

Let \\(x = \\frac{2n}{3n + 2}\\), then \\(S = -\\ln(1 - x)\\). Compute \\(1 - x = 1 - \\frac{2n}{3n + 2} = \\frac{(3n + 2) - 2n}{3n + 2} = \\frac{n + 2}{3n + 2}\\). Therefore, \\(S = -\\ln\\left(\\frac{n + 2}{3n + 2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(\\frac{3n + 2}{n + 2}\\right)\\).

Expanding this logarithm as a power series in \\(1/n\\):

\\(\\ln\\left(\\frac{3n + 2}{n + 2}\\right) = \\ln\\left(3 + \\frac{2}{n}\\right) - \\ln\\left(1 + \\frac{2}{n}\\right)\\). Wait, no:

Wait, \\(\\frac{3n + 2}{n + 2} = \\frac{3n + 2}{n + 2} = \\frac{3(n + 2) - 4}{n + 2} = 3 - \\frac{4}{n + 2}\\). This complicates things. Alternatively, expand around infinity:

\\(\\frac{3n + 2}{n + 2} = 3 - \\frac{4}{n + 2} \\approx 3 - \\frac{4}{n} + \\frac{8}{n^2} - \\frac{16}{n^3} + \\cdots\\). Taking the logarithm:

\\(\\ln(3 - \\frac{4}{n} + \\frac{8}{n^2} - \\cdots)\\). This is more complicated and doesn't lead directly to a simple expansion. Therefore, this is likely not the intended series.

Given that, I must conclude that the correct coefficient is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\), and the problem's provided answer is incorrect. However, since the user insists the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), there must be an error in the problem statement or in the expected solution. Without further information, I can't reconcile this discrepancy. 

Given the calculations above, the coefficient of \\(\\frac{1}{n^4}\\) in the given series is \\(-\\frac{4}{81}\\).

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

\\boxed{Yes}

","Okay, let's see. The problem is asking whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) such that (b, d) is not (0, 0) and the equation 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2 holds. Hmm, so we need to find rational numbers a, b, c, d where at least one of b or d is non-zero, and plug them into this quadratic form to get 2. 

First, maybe I should try to understand the equation better. The left-hand side is a sum of squares with coefficients 2, 3, 30, and 45. Since all coefficients are positive, each term is non-negative, so each variable's square term contributes positively to the total. But since we're dealing with rational numbers, maybe scaling can help. If we can find integers a, b, c, d such that 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2, then we can scale them down by a common denominator. But 2 is a small number, so perhaps trying small integers might work.

Alternatively, maybe set some variables to zero to simplify. Let's see. If we set c = 0 and d = 0, then the equation reduces to 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2. We need (b, d) â  (0, 0), so if we set d=0, we can set b â  0. Let's try to solve 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2 for rational numbers a and b. Let me see. Let's set a = p/k and b = q/k where p, q, k are integers. Then substituting into the equation:

2(pÂ²/kÂ²) + 3(qÂ²/kÂ²) = 2 â 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 2kÂ².

So we need integer solutions to 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 2kÂ². Let's see if there are any non-trivial solutions. Let's try small integers. Let's try q = 1. Then 2pÂ² + 3 = 2kÂ² â 2pÂ² = 2kÂ² - 3 â 2pÂ² = 2kÂ² - 3. The right-hand side must be even, but 2kÂ² is even, so 2kÂ² - 3 is odd. Therefore, 2pÂ² is odd, which is impossible because 2pÂ² is even. So q=1 gives no solution.

How about q=2? Then 2pÂ² + 3*(4) = 2kÂ² â 2pÂ² + 12 = 2kÂ² â pÂ² + 6 = kÂ². So kÂ² - pÂ² = 6 â (k - p)(k + p) = 6. The factors of 6 are (1,6), (2,3), (-1,-6), (-2,-3). Let's check:

Case 1: k - p = 1, k + p = 6. Adding equations: 2k = 7 â k = 3.5, which is not integer. Similarly, other factor pairs:

Case 2: k - p = 2, k + p = 3. Adding: 2k = 5 â k = 2.5, not integer.

Case 3: Negative factors: (-1, -6). Then k - p = -1, k + p = -6. Adding: 2k = -7 â k = -3.5, nope.

Case 4: (-2, -3). Adding: 2k = -5 â k = -2.5. Not integer. So no solution for q=2.

Hmm, maybe q=0? Then 2pÂ² = 2kÂ² â pÂ² = kÂ² â p = Â±k. Then a = p/k = Â±1. But then b = 0, so (b, d) would be (0,0) if d=0. So that's not allowed. So no solutions here.

Wait, maybe variables other than a and b? Let's try setting c to some non-zero value. For example, set c = 1, d = 0. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30 = 2 â 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = -28. But squares are non-negative, so left-hand side is non-negative, right is negative. Impossible. How about c = 1 and d = 1? Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30 + 45 = 2 â 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = -73. Still negative. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, set d non-zero and c zero. Let's try d = 1, c = 0. Then equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 45 = 2 â 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = -43. Again, impossible. Hmm.

Wait, maybe set d = 1 and c non-zero. Let's try d = 1, c = 1. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30 + 45 = 2 â 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = -73. Still negative. Not helpful.

Alternatively, set c = 1 and d = something else. Wait, but all terms except maybe a and b are positive. Wait, if we set c and d to non-zero, then 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² is positive, so 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² would have to be less than 2. But since a and b are rational, maybe fractions. Let's see.

Suppose we set c = 1/3. Then 30*(1/9) = 30/9 = 10/3. So 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 10/3 + 45dÂ² = 2. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2 - 10/3 = -4/3. Again negative. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, set c = 1/5. Then 30*(1/25) = 6/5. So 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 6/5 + 45dÂ² = 2 â 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2 - 6/5 = 4/5. So 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 4/5. Still, 45dÂ² is positive, so 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 4/5 - 45dÂ². If d is non-zero, then 45dÂ² is positive, so 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² would have to be less than 4/5. But even so, if we set d = 1/5, then 45*(1/25) = 9/5. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 4/5 - 9/5 = -5/5 = -1. Still negative. Not helpful.

Alternatively, set d = 1/m for some integer m. Then 45dÂ² = 45/mÂ². So 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² = 2 - 45/mÂ². We need 2 - 45/mÂ² to be positive, so 45/mÂ² < 2 â mÂ² > 45/2 â mÂ² > 22.5 â m â¥ 5. So m=5 gives 45/25 = 9/5. So 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² = 2 - 9/5 = 1/5. So 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² = 1/5. Then 30cÂ² â¤ 1/5 â cÂ² â¤ (1/5)/30 = 1/150 â c â¤ 1/â150 â 0.0816. So c must be small. Let's try c = 1/10. Then 30*(1/100) = 3/10. So 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 1/5 - 3/10 = (2/10 - 3/10) = -1/10. Negative again. Hmm.

Alternatively, set c = 1/15. Then 30*(1/225) = 30/225 = 2/15. So 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 1/5 - 2/15 = (3/15 - 2/15) = 1/15. So 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 1/15. Let's try to solve this. Let a = p/k, b = q/k. Then 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = kÂ²/15. Multiply both sides by 15: 30pÂ² + 45qÂ² = kÂ². So 30pÂ² + 45qÂ² = kÂ². Let's see if there are integers p, q, k. Let's try q=1: 30pÂ² + 45 = kÂ². So kÂ² - 30pÂ² = 45. Let's try p=1: kÂ² = 30 + 45 = 75. 75 is not a square. p=2: kÂ²=120 +45=165, not square. p=3: 270+45=315, nope. p=0: kÂ²=45, which is not square. p= -1: same as p=1. Not helpful.

q=2: 30pÂ² + 45*4 = kÂ² â 30pÂ² + 180 = kÂ² â kÂ² - 30pÂ² = 180. Let's try p=3: 270 + 180 = 450, nope. p=2: 120 + 180 = 300, not square. p=1: 30 + 180 = 210, nope. p=0: 180, not square. Hmm.

q=3: 30pÂ² + 45*9 = kÂ² â 30pÂ² + 405 = kÂ². Let's try p=3: 270 + 405 = 675, not square. p=2: 120 + 405 = 525, nope. p=1: 30 + 405 = 435, nope. p=0: 405, nope.

This approach isn't working. Maybe another way. Let's think about scaling. Suppose we have a solution (a, b, c, d) with rational numbers. Let's write them as fractions. Letâs set a = x/k, b = y/k, c = z/k, d = w/k, where x, y, z, w, k are integers, k â  0. Then substituting into the equation:

2(xÂ²/kÂ²) + 3(yÂ²/kÂ²) + 30(zÂ²/kÂ²) + 45(wÂ²/kÂ²) = 2.

Multiply both sides by kÂ²:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 2kÂ².

So we need integers x, y, z, w, k such that 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 2kÂ², and (y, w) â  (0, 0). Let's try to find such integers.

Let me try small values. Let's start with k=1. Then we need 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 2. Since all terms are non-negative, each term must be 0 or 1. Let's see:

Possible combinations:

If x=1: 2(1) = 2, so the rest must be 0. So y=0, z=0, w=0. But then (y, w) = (0,0), which is not allowed.

If x=0: Then 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 2. Each term is a multiple of 3: 3yÂ², 30zÂ²=3*10zÂ², 45wÂ²=3*15wÂ². So 3(yÂ² + 10zÂ² + 15wÂ²) = 2 â yÂ² + 10zÂ² + 15wÂ² = 2/3. Not integer. So no solution for k=1.

k=2: Then 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 8.

Again, need integers x, y, z, w. Let's try x=2: 2*4=8, so rest must be 0. Then y=z=w=0. Not allowed.

x=1: 2*1=2. Then 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6 â yÂ² + 10zÂ² + 15wÂ² = 2. Again, yÂ² + 10zÂ² + 15wÂ² = 2. Let's see possible y=1: 1 + 10zÂ² +15wÂ²=2 â 10zÂ² +15wÂ²=1. Not possible. y=0: 10zÂ² +15wÂ²=2. Again, 10zÂ² and 15wÂ² must be fractions. But z and w are integers. So 10zÂ² and 15wÂ² are integers. 10zÂ² +15wÂ²=2 â 5(2zÂ² +3wÂ²)=2 â 2zÂ² +3wÂ²=2/5. Not integer. So no solution.

k=3: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=18.

x=3: 2*9=18, rest=0. Not allowed.

x=2: 2*4=8. Remaining: 3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=10. Divide by 10: 3yÂ²/10 +3zÂ² +4.5wÂ²=1. Not helpful. Maybe y=1: 3 +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=10 â 30zÂ² +45wÂ²=7. No. y=0: 30zÂ² +45wÂ²=10 â 6zÂ² +9wÂ²=2. Again, 6zÂ² +9wÂ²=2 â 3(2zÂ² +3wÂ²)=2 â 2zÂ² +3wÂ²=2/3. Not integer.

k=4: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=32.

x=4: 2*16=32, rest=0. Not allowed.

x=3: 2*9=18. Remaining: 3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=14. Let's see. Divide by common factor? 3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=14. Let's set y=1: 3 +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=14 â 30zÂ² +45wÂ²=11. No. y=0: 30zÂ² +45wÂ²=14 â 5(6zÂ² +9wÂ²)=14 â Not integer.

k=5: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=50.

x=5: 2*25=50, rest=0. Not allowed.

x=4: 2*16=32. Remaining: 18. Let's see. 3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=18. Divide by 3: yÂ² +10zÂ² +15wÂ²=6. Let's try y=2: 4 +10zÂ² +15wÂ²=6 â 10zÂ² +15wÂ²=2. Not possible. y=1: 1 +10zÂ² +15wÂ²=6 â 10zÂ² +15wÂ²=5 â 2zÂ² +3wÂ²=1. Let's solve 2zÂ² +3wÂ²=1. z=0: 3wÂ²=1 â wÂ²=1/3. Not integer. z=1: 2 +3wÂ²=1 â 3wÂ²=-1. No. So no solution.

k=6: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=72.

x=6: 2*36=72, rest=0. Not allowed.

x=5: 2*25=50. Remaining: 22. 3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=22. Let's see. Divide by common factor 1: 3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=22. Let's try y=1: 3 +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=22 â 30zÂ² +45wÂ²=19. Not possible. y=0: 30zÂ² +45wÂ²=22 â 5(6zÂ² +9wÂ²)=22 â Not integer.

Hmm, this approach of trying small k isn't working. Maybe there's a different strategy. Let's think about scaling variables. Suppose we set c and d to be non-zero. Let's suppose that c and d are both non-zero. Then 30cÂ² +45dÂ² is at least 30*(1/kÂ²) +45*(1/kÂ²) = 75/kÂ². So 2aÂ² +3bÂ² = 2 -75/kÂ². Wait, but if k is a denominator, then 75/kÂ² must be less than 2. So 75/kÂ² < 2 â kÂ² > 75/2 â kÂ² > 37.5 â k â¥ 7. So k=7: 75/49 â1.53. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ² â0.47. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe set c = d = 1/3. Then 30*(1/9) +45*(1/9) = 30/9 +45/9 = 75/9 = 25/3. Then 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +25/3 =2 â 2aÂ² +3bÂ² =2 -25/3 = -19/3. Negative. Not possible.

Alternatively, set c =1/2, d=1/2. Then 30*(1/4) +45*(1/4) =75/4. 75/4 >2, so 2aÂ² +3bÂ² would be negative. Not possible.

Alternatively, set c=1/5, d=1/5. Then 30*(1/25) +45*(1/25)=75/25=3. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=2 -3= -1. Negative. No.

Hmm. Maybe set one of c or d non-zero and the other zero. Let's try c=1/5, d=0. Then 30*(1/25)=6/5. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=2 -6/5=4/5. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=4/5. Let's try solving this. Let a= m/n, b= p/n. Then 2mÂ² +3pÂ²=4nÂ². Let's find integers m, p, n. Let's try n=1: 2mÂ² +3pÂ²=4. Possible solutions? m=1: 2 +3pÂ²=4 â3pÂ²=2âpÂ²=2/3. Not integer. m=0: 3pÂ²=4âpÂ²=4/3. No. m=2: 8 +3pÂ²=4â3pÂ²=-4. No. No solutions.

n=2: 2mÂ² +3pÂ²=16. Let's try m=2: 8 +3pÂ²=16 â3pÂ²=8âpÂ²=8/3. No. m=3: 18 +3pÂ²=16â3pÂ²=-2. No. m=1: 2 +3pÂ²=16â3pÂ²=14âpÂ²=14/3. No.

n=5: 2mÂ² +3pÂ²=4*25=100. Let's try m=5: 50 +3pÂ²=100â3pÂ²=50âpÂ²=50/3. No. m=10: 200 +3pÂ²=100âNo. Hmm.

Alternatively, set c=1/3, d=0. Then 30*(1/9)=10/3. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=2 -10/3= -4/3. Negative. Not possible.

Alternatively, set d=1/3, c=0. Then 45*(1/9)=5. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=2 -5= -3. Negative. No.

Hmm. Maybe set d=1/6. Then 45*(1/36)=45/36=5/4. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ²=2 -5/4=3/4. Let's try 30cÂ²=3/4 -2aÂ² -3bÂ². So 30cÂ² must be positive, so 3/4 -2aÂ² -3bÂ² >0. Let's set a=0. Then 3bÂ² <3/4 âbÂ² <1/4 âb=Â±1/2. Let's try b=1/2. Then 3*(1/4)=3/4. So 30cÂ²=3/4 -3/4=0âc=0. Then d=1/6. So (b,d)=(1/2,1/6)â (0,0). Then check the equation: 2*0 +3*(1/2)^2 +30*0 +45*(1/6)^2= 3*(1/4) +45*(1/36)= 3/4 +45/36= 3/4 +5/4=8/4=2. Yes! That works. Wait, so a=0, b=1/2, c=0, d=1/6. Then (b,d)=(1/2,1/6)â (0,0). And substituting into the equation: 2*0 +3*(1/2)^2 +30*0 +45*(1/6)^2= 3*(1/4) +45*(1/36)= 3/4 + (45/36)= 3/4 +5/4=2. Exactly! So this works. So there exists such a 4-tuple: (0, 1/2, 0, 1/6).

Wait, so maybe I was overcomplicating. By setting c=0 and d=1/6, and b=1/2, a=0, the equation holds. So yes, such a 4-tuple exists. Therefore, the answer should be yes, there exists such a 4-tuple.

But let me verify this again. Let's compute each term:

2aÂ²: 2*(0)^2 =0

3bÂ²:3*(1/2)^2=3*(1/4)=3/4

30cÂ²:30*(0)^2=0

45dÂ²:45*(1/6)^2=45*(1/36)=45/36=5/4

Adding them up:0 +3/4 +0 +5/4=8/4=2. Perfect. So yes, (0, 1/2, 0, 1/6) is a solution. Therefore, the answer is yes.

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

","Okay, let's see. I need to determine if there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) where (b, d) isn't both zero, such that 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² equals 2/(3). Hmm, so first, maybe I should write down the equation properly: 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. And we need rational numbers a, b, c, d, with at least one of b or d not zero. 

Wait, the equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let me check if I wrote that correctly. The user wrote ""2\\.\\frac{2}{3}"" which probably is a typo, but maybe they meant 2*(2/3) = 4/3? Wait, the original problem says ""2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2.\\frac{2}{3}"". Hmm, maybe it's supposed to be 2*(2/3) = 4/3. But the original equation is written as 2aÂ² + ... = 2.frac{2}{3}, which might be 2.666... or 8/3. Wait, maybe the user made a mistake in formatting. Let me check again. The original problem says:

""Determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2.\\frac{2}{3}\\).""

Ah, maybe the ""2.\\frac{2}{3}"" is a decimal mixed with a fraction, which would be 2 + 2/3 = 8/3. So the equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 8/3. That makes sense. So the right-hand side is 8/3. Okay, so the equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 8/3.

Now, the question is whether there are non-zero b and/or d (i.e., (b, d) â  (0,0)) such that this equation holds with a, b, c, d all rational. So we need to see if there's a solution in rational numbers where at least one of b or d is non-zero.

First, since we need rational numbers, maybe I can scale the variables. Let me think. If I set a, b, c, d to be rational, then multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators might help. Let's try that. Multiply both sides by 3:

3*(2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ²) = 3*(8/3)

Which simplifies to:

6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 8

Now, all coefficients are integers. So the equation is 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 8, with a, b, c, d â â. But maybe scaling variables could make it easier. Let me think. Suppose we set a = x/k, b = y/k, c = z/k, d = w/k, where x, y, z, w, k are integers. Then substituting into the equation:

6*(x/k)Â² + 9*(y/k)Â² + 90*(z/k)Â² + 135*(w/k)Â² = 8

Multiply both sides by kÂ²:

6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 8kÂ²

So now we have an equation in integers: 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 8kÂ². We need to find integers x, y, z, w, k such that this holds, with at least one of y or w not zero (since (b, d) â  (0,0) translates to (y/k, w/k) â  (0,0), so y or w â  0). So we can rephrase the problem as: does the equation 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 8kÂ² have non-trivial integer solutions?

Alternatively, perhaps we can divide both sides by some common factors. Let's see. The left-hand side is 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ². Let's factor out common terms. 6, 9, 90, 135. The greatest common divisor of 6, 9, 90, 135 is 3. So divide both sides by 3:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (8/3)kÂ²

Wait, but now we have fractions again. Hmm, maybe this approach isn't helpful. Let's think differently.

Alternatively, maybe we can look for solutions where some variables are zero. For example, set c = 0 and d = 0. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 8/3. Is there a rational solution here with b â  0? Let's see. Let me denote a and b as rational numbers. Letâs set a = m/n and b = p/n, where m, p, n are integers, n â  0. Then:

2*(mÂ²/nÂ²) + 3*(pÂ²/nÂ²) = 8/3

Multiply both sides by nÂ²:

2mÂ² + 3pÂ² = (8/3)nÂ²

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:

6mÂ² + 9pÂ² = 8nÂ²

So we have 6mÂ² + 9pÂ² = 8nÂ². Let's see if there are integer solutions to this equation with p â  0. Let's try small integers. Let's test p = 1.

Then 6mÂ² + 9 = 8nÂ². So 8nÂ² - 6mÂ² = 9. Let's see if this is possible. Letâs rearrange: 8nÂ² = 9 + 6mÂ². So 8 divides the right-hand side. But 9 + 6mÂ² â¡ 9 + 6*(mÂ²) mod 8. 6 â¡ 6 mod 8, and mÂ² mod 8 can be 0,1,4. So 6*0=0, 6*1=6, 6*4=24â¡0 mod8. Therefore:

If mÂ² â¡0 mod8, then RHS â¡9 +0=1 mod8. But 8nÂ²â¡0 mod8, so 0â¡1 mod8? No.

If mÂ²â¡1 mod8, RHSâ¡9 +6=15â¡7 mod8. Again, 8nÂ²â¡0 mod8. Not possible.

If mÂ²â¡4 mod8, RHSâ¡9 +24â¡33â¡1 mod8. Again, 0â¡1 mod8. Not possible. Therefore, no solutions when p=1.

Similarly, p=2:

6mÂ² + 9*4 = 6mÂ² + 36 = 8nÂ²

So 8nÂ² -6mÂ²=36. Divide by 2: 4nÂ² -3mÂ²=18. Let's see. Let's rearrange: 4nÂ² = 3mÂ² +18. So 4 divides the right-hand side. 3mÂ² +18 = 3(mÂ² +6). So 4 divides 3(mÂ² +6). Since 4 and 3 are coprime, 4 divides (mÂ² +6). So mÂ² +6 â¡0 mod4. mÂ² mod4 can be 0 or 1. So mÂ² +6 â¡0+6=6â¡2 mod4 or 1+6=7â¡3 mod4. Neither is 0. Therefore, no solutions.

p=3: 6mÂ² +9*9=6mÂ² +81=8nÂ²

So 8nÂ² -6mÂ²=81. Then 8nÂ² =6mÂ² +81. Left-hand side is even, right-hand side is 6mÂ² +81. 6mÂ² is even, 81 is odd. So even + odd = odd. But left-hand side is even. Contradiction. No solutions.

p=4: 6mÂ² +9*16=6mÂ² +144=8nÂ²

So 8nÂ² -6mÂ²=144. Divide by 2:4nÂ² -3mÂ²=72. Let's rearrange:4nÂ²=3mÂ² +72. So 4 divides 3(mÂ² +24). Again, 4 divides 3(mÂ² +24). Since 4 and 3 are coprime, 4 divides (mÂ² +24). So mÂ² +24 â¡0 mod4. mÂ² mod4 is 0 or1. So mÂ² +24 â¡0+24=24â¡0 mod4 or 1+24=25â¡1 mod4. So only when mÂ² â¡0 mod4. Thus, m must be even. Let m=2k. Then:

4nÂ² =3*(4kÂ²) +72=12kÂ² +72. Divide both sides by 4: nÂ²=3kÂ² +18. So nÂ² -3kÂ²=18. This is a Pell-type equation. Let's see if there are integer solutions. Let's try small k.

k=1: nÂ²=3 +18=21. Not a square.

k=2: nÂ²=12 +18=30. Not a square.

k=3: nÂ²=27 +18=45. Not a square.

k=4: nÂ²=48 +18=66. No.

k=5: 75 +18=93. No.

k=6: 108 +18=126. No.

k=7: 147 +18=165. No.

k=8: 192 +18=210. No. Hmm, maybe negative k. But squares are same. Maybe k=0: nÂ²=0 +18=18. Not a square. So seems no solutions here either.

p=5: 6mÂ² +9*25=6mÂ² +225=8nÂ². So 8nÂ²=6mÂ² +225. Left-hand side is even, right-hand side is 6mÂ² (even) +225 (odd) = even + odd = odd. Contradiction. No solution.

p=6: 6mÂ² +9*36=6mÂ² +324=8nÂ². 8nÂ²=6mÂ² +324. Divide by 2:4nÂ²=3mÂ² +162. So 4 divides 3(mÂ² +54). Hence, 4 divides (mÂ² +54). mÂ² â¡0 or1 mod4. So mÂ² +54 â¡0 +54=54â¡2 mod4 or 1 +54=55â¡3 mod4. Neither is 0. So no solution.

Hmm, this approach is not fruitful. Maybe setting c and d to zero is not the right way. Alternatively, perhaps we need to consider non-zero c or d. Let's try setting c=0 and dâ 0.

So c=0, then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² +45dÂ²=8/3. Let's again set a = m/n, b = p/n, d = q/n. Then:

2(mÂ²/nÂ²) + 3(pÂ²/nÂ²) +45(qÂ²/nÂ²)=8/3

Multiply by nÂ²:

2mÂ² +3pÂ² +45qÂ²= (8/3)nÂ²

Multiply by 3:

6mÂ² +9pÂ² +135qÂ²=8nÂ²

So equation:6mÂ² +9pÂ² +135qÂ²=8nÂ². Again, looking for integer solutions with p or q non-zero.

Let me try q=1. Then:

6mÂ² +9pÂ² +135=8nÂ²

So 8nÂ² -6mÂ² -9pÂ²=135. Let's see if this is possible. Let's rearrange:8nÂ² =6mÂ² +9pÂ² +135. Let's check modulo 3. Left side:8nÂ² â¡2nÂ² mod3. Right side:6mÂ²â¡0, 9pÂ²â¡0, 135â¡0 mod3. So 2nÂ²â¡0 mod3 â nÂ²â¡0 mod3 â nâ¡0 mod3. Let n=3k. Then:

8*(9kÂ²)=6mÂ² +9pÂ² +135 â72kÂ²=6mÂ² +9pÂ² +135 â Divide both sides by 3:24kÂ²=2mÂ² +3pÂ² +45

So now equation:24kÂ²=2mÂ² +3pÂ² +45. Let's rearrange:2mÂ² +3pÂ²=24kÂ² -45. Let's check modulo 3. Left side:2mÂ² +3pÂ² â¡2mÂ² mod3. Right side:24kÂ²â¡0 mod3, -45â¡0 mod3. So 2mÂ²â¡0 mod3 â mÂ²â¡0 mod3 â mâ¡0 mod3. Let m=3j. Then:

2*(9jÂ²) +3pÂ²=24kÂ² -45 â18jÂ² +3pÂ²=24kÂ² -45 âDivide by 3:6jÂ² +pÂ²=8kÂ² -15

Thus, pÂ²=8kÂ² -15 -6jÂ². Let's rearrange: pÂ² +6jÂ²=8kÂ² -15. Let's check modulo 4. pÂ²â¡0 or1 mod4, 6jÂ²â¡0 or2 mod4 (since 6â¡2 mod4, and jÂ²â¡0 or1). So left side: pÂ² +6jÂ² â¡0+0=0, 0+2=2, 1+0=1, 1+2=3 mod4. Right side:8kÂ² -15â¡0 -15â¡-15â¡1 mod4 (since -15 mod4 is -15 +16=1). So right sideâ¡1 mod4. So left side must â¡1 mod4. Which happens only if pÂ² +6jÂ²â¡1 mod4. For that, possible combinations:

pÂ²â¡1 mod4 and 6jÂ²â¡0 mod4: 1 +0=1 mod4. So p must be odd and j even.

Or pÂ²â¡0 mod4 and 6jÂ²â¡1 mod4: 0 +1=1 mod4. But 6jÂ²â¡1 mod4 implies 6jÂ²â¡1 mod4 â 2jÂ²â¡1 mod4, which is impossible because 2jÂ² is 0 or 2 mod4. So only possible if p is odd and j is even.

Letâs set j=2t (even), p=2s+1 (odd). Then:

pÂ²=(2s+1)^2=4sÂ² +4s +1

6jÂ²=6*(4tÂ²)=24tÂ²

Thus, left side:4sÂ² +4s +1 +24tÂ²

Right side:8kÂ² -15

So equation becomes:

4sÂ² +4s +1 +24tÂ² =8kÂ² -15

Rearranged:4sÂ² +4s +24tÂ²=8kÂ² -16

Divide both sides by 4:

sÂ² +s +6tÂ²=2kÂ² -4

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Let's try small values. Letâs set t=0 first:

sÂ² +s =2kÂ² -4

sÂ² +s +4=2kÂ²

Looking for integer solutions. Letâs try s=-1: 1 -1 +4=4=2kÂ² âkÂ²=2. No. s=0:0 +0 +4=4=2kÂ² âkÂ²=2. No. s=1:1 +1 +4=6=2kÂ² âkÂ²=3. No. s=2:4 +2 +4=10=2kÂ² âkÂ²=5. No. s=3:9 +3 +4=16=2kÂ² âkÂ²=8. No. s=4:16 +4 +4=24=2kÂ² âkÂ²=12. No. s=5:25 +5 +4=34=2kÂ² âkÂ²=17. No. Similarly negative s:

s=-2:4 -2 +4=6=2kÂ² âkÂ²=3. No. s=-3:9 -3 +4=10=2kÂ² âkÂ²=5. No. So no solutions with t=0.

t=1:

sÂ² +s +6=2kÂ² -4 âsÂ² +s +10=2kÂ²

Looking for integer solutions. Let's try s=1:1 +1 +10=12=2kÂ² âkÂ²=6. No. s=2:4 +2 +10=16=2kÂ² âkÂ²=8. No. s=3:9 +3 +10=22=2kÂ² âkÂ²=11. No. s=4:16 +4 +10=30=2kÂ² âkÂ²=15. No. s=0:0 +0 +10=10=2kÂ² âkÂ²=5. No. s=-1:1 -1 +10=10=2kÂ² âkÂ²=5. No. s=-2:4 -2 +10=12=2kÂ² âkÂ²=6. No. Similarly no solutions here.

t=2:

sÂ² +s +24=2kÂ² -4 âsÂ² +s +28=2kÂ²

Trying s=1:1 +1 +28=30=2kÂ² âkÂ²=15. No. s=2:4 +2 +28=34=2kÂ² âkÂ²=17. No. s=3:9 +3 +28=40=2kÂ² âkÂ²=20. No. s=4:16 +4 +28=48=2kÂ² âkÂ²=24. No. s=5:25 +5 +28=58=2kÂ² âkÂ²=29. No. s=6:36 +6 +28=70=2kÂ² âkÂ²=35. No. Negative s: s=-1:1 -1 +28=28=2kÂ² âkÂ²=14. No. s=-2:4 -2 +28=30=2kÂ² âkÂ²=15. No. s=-3:9 -3 +28=34=2kÂ² âkÂ²=17. No. So no solutions here either.

This seems not working. Maybe trying q=1 is not helpful. Let's try q=2. Then:

6mÂ² +9pÂ² +135*(4)=8nÂ² â6mÂ² +9pÂ² +540=8nÂ²

So 8nÂ² -6mÂ² -9pÂ²=540. Let's check modulo 3 again. 8nÂ²â¡2nÂ² mod3, 6mÂ²â¡0, 9pÂ²â¡0, 540â¡0 mod3. So 2nÂ²â¡0 mod3 ânâ¡0 mod3. Let n=3k. Then:

8*(9kÂ²)=6mÂ² +9pÂ² +540 â72kÂ²=6mÂ² +9pÂ² +540 âDivide by 3:24kÂ²=2mÂ² +3pÂ² +180

Rearrange:2mÂ² +3pÂ²=24kÂ² -180. Let's check modulo 4. Left side:2mÂ² +3pÂ². Right side:24kÂ² -180â¡0 - 0=0 mod4. So 2mÂ² +3pÂ²â¡0 mod4. Let's see possible residues:

mÂ² mod4 is 0 or1, pÂ² mod4 is 0 or1.

If mÂ²=0, pÂ²=0: 0 +0=0. Okay.

If mÂ²=0, pÂ²=1:0 +3=3â¡3 mod4â 0.

If mÂ²=1, pÂ²=0:2 +0=2â¡2 mod4â 0.

If mÂ²=1, pÂ²=1:2 +3=5â¡1 mod4â 0.

So only possible if m and p both even.

Let m=2j, p=2s. Then:

2*(4jÂ²) +3*(4sÂ²)=24kÂ² -180 â8jÂ² +12sÂ²=24kÂ² -180 âDivide by 4:2jÂ² +3sÂ²=6kÂ² -45

Rearrange:2jÂ² +3sÂ² +45=6kÂ². Let's check modulo 3. Left side:2jÂ² +0 +0â¡2jÂ² mod3. Right side:0. So 2jÂ²â¡0 mod3 âjâ¡0 mod3. Let j=3t. Then:

2*(9tÂ²) +3sÂ² +45=6kÂ² â18tÂ² +3sÂ² +45=6kÂ² âDivide by 3:6tÂ² +sÂ² +15=2kÂ²

Rearrange:sÂ²=2kÂ² -6tÂ² -15. Let's check modulo 4. Left side sÂ²â¡0 or1 mod4. Right side:2kÂ² -6tÂ² -15â¡2kÂ² -2tÂ² -3 mod4. Let's compute:

If k even: k=2n, kÂ²=0 mod4 â2*0=0; t even: t=2m, tÂ²=0 â-2*0=0 â0 -3=1 mod4. So 0 -3=1. So sÂ²â¡1 mod4. Which is possible if s is odd.

If t is odd: t=2m+1, tÂ²=1 â-6*1= -6â¡2 mod4. So 0 +2 -3= -1â¡3 mod4. Not possible.

If k odd: k=2n+1, kÂ²=1 â2*1=2; t even:0 â2 -3= -1â¡3 mod4. Not possible.

If t odd: t=2m+1 â2 -6*1=2 -6= -4â¡0 mod4. Then 0 -3=1 mod4. So sÂ²â¡1 mod4. So s must be odd.

So possible if k even and t even, leading to s odd. Let's try t=0:

sÂ²=2kÂ² -15. Let's try k=3: sÂ²=18 -15=3. Not square. k=4: sÂ²=32 -15=17. No. k=5:50 -15=35. No. k=6:72 -15=57. No. k=7:98 -15=83. No. k=8:128 -15=113. No. k=9:162 -15=147. No. k=10:200 -15=185. No. Similarly negative k: same. No solutions.

sÂ²=2kÂ² -6*1 -15=2kÂ² -21. Let's try k=4:32 -21=11. No. k=5:50 -21=29. No. k=6:72 -21=51. No. k=7:98 -21=77. No. k=8:128 -21=107. No. k=9:162 -21=141. No. k=10:200 -21=179. No. k=3:18 -21=-3. Negative. No.

This approach is getting too tedious. Maybe there's a different way. Alternatively, maybe we can consider the equation as a quadratic form and check if it's isotropic over the rationals. That is, whether the equation has a non-trivial solution in â^4. To check this, we can use the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, which states that a quadratic form is isotropic over â if and only if it is isotropic over all completions of â, i.e., over â and all â_p.

First, check over â. The equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ² = 8/3. Since all coefficients are positive, the left-hand side is always non-negative, and equals 8/3 >0. So there are real solutions. For example, set a, b, c, d to be real numbers such that the equation holds. For instance, set a=0, b=0, c=0, d= sqrt(8/(3*45)) = sqrt(8/135) = (2â2)/(3â15). But this is a real solution. However, we need rational solutions.

Now, according to Hasse-Minkowski, if the equation is isotropic over â and over all â_p, then it has a rational solution. So we need to check local solubility at all primes p.

First, the equation over â is solvable, as shown.

Now, check p=2,3,5, etc.

For p=2: Check if the equation has a non-trivial solution in â¤/2â¤^4. Let's reduce the equation modulo 2. The equation is 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ² â¡0 mod2. 2aÂ²â¡0, 3bÂ²â¡bÂ², 30cÂ²â¡0, 45dÂ²â¡1*dÂ² mod2. So equation becomes bÂ² +dÂ²â¡0 mod2. Which is equivalent to bâ¡dâ¡0 mod2. So only the trivial solution modulo 2. Wait, but Hasse-Minkowski says that if it's isotropic over â and over all â_p, then it has a rational solution. But if modulo 2, the only solution is trivial, does that imply something? Wait, actually, modulo 2, the equation is 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ² â¡0 mod2. Let's compute each term:

2aÂ² â¡0 mod2,

3bÂ² â¡1*bÂ² mod2,

30cÂ² â¡0 mod2,

45dÂ² â¡1*dÂ² mod2.

So equation: bÂ² + dÂ² â¡0 mod2. The squares modulo2 are 0 or1. So bÂ² +dÂ² â¡0 mod2 implies both b and d are even. So the only solution modulo2 is aâ¡0, bâ¡0, câ¡0, dâ¡0 mod2. But this is the trivial solution. However, in the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, we need the equation to be isotropic over â_p for each p. Isotropy over â_p means that the equation has a non-trivial solution in â_p. But modulo2, the only solution is trivial, which would imply that there are no non-trivial solutions in â_2. Therefore, the equation is not isotropic over â_2, which would imply that there are no non-trivial rational solutions. But wait, the original equation is 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=8/3. If we can find a solution in â_2, then by Hasse-Minkowski, there exists a rational solution. But if there is no solution in â_2, then there are no rational solutions.

Therefore, we need to check if the equation has a non-trivial solution in â_2. Let's try to find such a solution. Let's look for a solution where a,b,c,d are in â_2, not all zero. Let's attempt to find a solution.

Letâs consider the equation 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ² =8/3 in â_2. Letâs multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=8. Now, we can check modulo higher powers of 2. Letâs first check modulo2.

6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ² â¡0 +1*bÂ² +0 +1*dÂ²â¡bÂ² +dÂ²â¡0 mod2. So again, b and d must be even. Letâs set b=2b', d=2d'. Then:

6aÂ² +9*(2b')Â² +90cÂ² +135*(2d')Â²=8 â6aÂ² +36b'Â² +90cÂ² +540d'Â²=8.

Now, modulo4:

6aÂ² â¡2aÂ²,

36b'Â²â¡0,

90cÂ²â¡2cÂ²,

540d'Â²â¡0.

So equation becomes 2aÂ² +2cÂ² â¡8â¡0 mod4. Thus, 2(aÂ² +cÂ²)â¡0 mod4 âaÂ² +cÂ²â¡0 mod2. So a and c must both be even. Set a=2a', c=2c'. Substitute:

6*(4a'Â²) +36b'Â² +90*(4c'Â²) +540d'Â²=8 â24a'Â² +36b'Â² +360c'Â² +540d'Â²=8.

Divide by 4:6a'Â² +9b'Â² +90c'Â² +135d'Â²=2.

Now modulo4:

6a'Â²â¡2a'Â²,

9b'Â²â¡1b'Â²,

90c'Â²â¡2c'Â²,

135d'Â²â¡3d'Â².

So equation becomes 2a'Â² +b'Â² +2c'Â² +3d'Â²â¡2 mod4.

Letâs see if there are solutions here. Let's try a'=0, b'=0, c'=0, d'=1: 0 +0 +0 +3â¡3â¡3 mod4â 2. a'=0, b'=1, c'=0, d'=0:0 +1 +0 +0â¡1â¡1 mod4â 2. a'=1, b'=0, c'=0, d'=0:2 +0 +0 +0â¡2 mod4. Yes! So 2a'Â² +b'Â² +2c'Â² +3d'Â² â¡2 mod4 when a'=1, others zero. So this is a solution. Therefore, there exists a solution in â_2. Therefore, by Hasse-Minkowski, since the equation is isotropic over â and over â_2 (and presumably other â_p), then there exists a rational solution. Wait, but we need to check for all â_p. Wait, we checked p=2, but need to check others as well. However, if even one â_p is anisotropic, then the equation has no solutions. But we found that over â_2, there is a solution, but earlier modulo2, the only solution is trivial. Wait, but in â_2, we can have solutions that are non-trivial. So even though modulo2 the equation only has the trivial solution, in â_2, there are non-trivial solutions. Hence, the equation is isotropic over â_2. Therefore, by Hasse-Minkowski, since it's isotropic over â and over all â_p (including â_2), then there exists a rational solution. Therefore, the answer is yes, such a 4-tuple exists.

But wait, let me check another prime, say p=3. Let's check if the equation is isotropic over â_3. Let's reduce the equation modulo3. Original equation:2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=8/3. Multiply both sides by3:6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=8. Modulo3:

6aÂ²â¡0, 9bÂ²â¡0, 90cÂ²â¡0, 135dÂ²â¡0. So equation becomes0â¡8â¡2 mod3. Contradiction. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. Wait, modulo3, 8â¡2 mod3. So the equation becomes0â¡2 mod3. Which is impossible. Therefore, there are no solutions in â_3. Therefore, the equation is anisotropic over â_3, hence by Hasse-Minkowski, there are no rational solutions. Therefore, the answer is no.

Wait, this contradicts the previous conclusion. What's going on here. Let me double-check.

Original equation:2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=8/3. Multiply by3:6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=8. Now, modulo3:

6aÂ²â¡0, 9bÂ²â¡0, 90cÂ²â¡0, 135dÂ²â¡0. So 0â¡8 mod3 â0â¡2 mod3. Contradiction. Therefore, there are no solutions in â¤/3â¤, hence no solutions in â_3. Therefore, the equation is anisotropic over â_3, so by Hasse-Minkowski, since it's anisotropic over â_3, there are no rational solutions. Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, earlier I thought there was a solution in â_2, but since there is no solution in â_3, the equation cannot have a rational solution. Therefore, the answer is no. So the conclusion is that no such 4-tuple exists.

But let me verify this again. Because the equation, when multiplied by3, becomes6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=8. Modulo3, all coefficients are divisible by3, so left side is divisible by3, but right side is8â¡2 mod3. Contradiction. Therefore, no solutions in â_3, hence no solutions in â. Therefore, the answer is no.

Therefore, despite the equation having a solution in â and â_2, it has no solution in â_3, hence no rational solutions. Therefore, such a 4-tuple does not exist.

Thus, the answer is no.

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

","Okay, so I have this problem here: Determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) such that (b, d) â  (0, 0) and 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/(3). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First off, the equation given is a quadratic form in four variables with coefficients 2, 3, 30, and 45 for aÂ², bÂ², cÂ², and dÂ² respectively. The right-hand side is 2 divided by 3, which is approximately 0.666... The question is whether there are non-trivial rational solutions (since (b, d) can't both be zero) to this equation.

I remember that equations of this form can sometimes be approached by scaling or substitution. Since we're dealing with rational numbers, maybe scaling by a common denominator could help. Let's see. The coefficients of the squares are 2, 3, 30, 45. If I can find a substitution that simplifies the equation, that might make it easier to find solutions.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this as a quadratic form and use some number theory. For equations with rational coefficients, one approach is to clear denominators by multiplying both sides by a suitable integer to make all coefficients integers. Let's try that.

The right-hand side is 2/3. If I multiply both sides by 3, the equation becomes 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. But 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. Hmm, still not very friendly. Maybe multiplying by a higher multiple to make all coefficients integers and then check for integer solutions? Wait, but if we want rational solutions, scaling by a common denominator might not directly give integer solutions unless we set variables appropriately.

Alternatively, perhaps set variables as fractions over some integer. Let me think. Suppose a = x/k, b = y/k, c = z/k, d = w/k where x, y, z, w, k are integers, k â  0. Then the equation becomes:

2(x/k)Â² + 3(y/k)Â² + 30(z/k)Â² + 45(w/k)Â² = 2/3

Multiplying both sides by kÂ²:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)kÂ²

But the left-hand side is an integer since x, y, z, w, k are integers. The right-hand side is (2/3)kÂ². For this to be an integer, kÂ² must be divisible by 3, so k must be divisible by 3. Let k = 3m, where m is an integer. Then the equation becomes:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)(9mÂ²) = 6mÂ²

So now we have 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6mÂ². Let's divide both sides by 3 to simplify:

(2/3)xÂ² + yÂ² + 10zÂ² + 15wÂ² = 2mÂ²

But maybe this isn't helpful. Alternatively, maybe set m as a variable. Wait, perhaps instead of scaling, we can look for solutions where a, b, c, d are fractions with denominator dividing some number. But this seems a bit vague.

Alternatively, maybe think of the equation as 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let's try to find a solution by trial and error. Since we need (b, d) â  (0,0), let's see if we can set some variables to zero and solve for others.

Suppose we set c = 0 and d = 0. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. But (b, d) would be (b,0), so as long as b â  0, this is acceptable. Let's try solving 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. Let's set a = 0. Then 3bÂ² = 2/3 â bÂ² = 2/9 â b = Â±â(2)/3. But â2 is irrational, so b is irrational. Therefore, a and b would have to be fractions with denominator 3, but even then, the square roots would complicate things.

Alternatively, maybe set a = k, b = l, with k and l rational. Let's write the equation as 2kÂ² + 3lÂ² = 2/3. Let's rearrange: 3lÂ² = 2/3 - 2kÂ² â lÂ² = (2/3 - 2kÂ²)/3 â lÂ² = 2/9 - (2/3)kÂ². For lÂ² to be non-negative, 2/9 - (2/3)kÂ² â¥ 0 â (2/3)kÂ² â¤ 2/9 â kÂ² â¤ (2/9)/(2/3) = (2/9)*(3/2) = 1/3. So kÂ² â¤ 1/3 â |k| â¤ 1/â3 â 0.577. So possible rational k values with small denominators: 0, Â±1/2, Â±1/3, etc.

Let me try k = 1/3. Then lÂ² = 2/9 - (2/3)(1/9) = 2/9 - 2/27 = (6/27 - 2/27) = 4/27 â l = Â±2/(3â3) = Â±2â3/9. But this is irrational. Similarly, k = 1/2: lÂ² = 2/9 - (2/3)(1/4) = 2/9 - 1/6 = (4/18 - 3/18) = 1/18 â l = Â±1/(3â2), which is also irrational.

k = 1/1: Well, 1 squared is 1, which is larger than 1/3, so no. k = 0: Then lÂ² = 2/9 â l = Â±â2/3, which is irrational. So no solutions in this case where c = d = 0. Therefore, we need to consider non-zero c or d.

Perhaps set c and d to non-zero values. Let me try setting c = 1 and d = 1. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30(1)Â² + 45(1)Â² = 2/3 â 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30 + 45 = 2/3 â 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 75 = -74.833... which is negative. So no solution here.

Wait, maybe set c and d to smaller numbers. Let's try c = 1/5 and d = 1/5. Then 30*(1/5)^2 + 45*(1/5)^2 = 30*(1/25) + 45*(1/25) = (30 + 45)/25 = 75/25 = 3. So the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 3 = 2/3 â 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 3 = -7/3. Still negative. Not possible.

Alternatively, set c = 1/10 and d = 1/10. Then 30*(1/10)^2 + 45*(1/10)^2 = 30/100 + 45/100 = 75/100 = 3/4. So equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 3/4 = 2/3 â 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 3/4 = (8/12 - 9/12) = -1/12. Still negative. Hmm.

Alternatively, set c and d to be negative. But since they are squared, it doesn't matter. Maybe set c or d to zero and the other non-zero. Let's try c = 0, d = 1/3. Then 45*(1/3)^2 = 45*(1/9) = 5. So equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 5 = 2/3 â 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 5 = -13/3. Still negative. Not helpful.

Wait, perhaps set c and d to be fractions that make the entire equation equal to 2/3. Let's think differently. Let's consider scaling variables. Let me set a = x, b = y, c = z, d = w, and try to find x, y, z, w rational numbers such that 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe set variables to be fractions with denominator 3. Let me try a = p/3, b = q/3, c = r/3, d = s/3, where p, q, r, s are integers. Then the equation becomes:

2*(pÂ²/9) + 3*(qÂ²/9) + 30*(rÂ²/9) + 45*(sÂ²/9) = 2/3

Simplify each term:

(2pÂ²)/9 + (3qÂ²)/9 + (30rÂ²)/9 + (45sÂ²)/9 = 2/3

Combine the fractions:

(2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ²)/9 = 2/3

Multiply both sides by 9:

2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6

So now, the equation is 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6, where p, q, r, s are integers. And we need (y, w) â  (0,0), which corresponds to (q/3, s/3) â  (0,0), so (q, s) â  (0,0).

So now the problem reduces to finding integers p, q, r, s (not all zero for q and s) such that 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6. Let's see if such integers exist.

This seems more manageable. Let's look for small integer solutions. Let's try q and s first since they have coefficients 3 and 45, which are multiples of 3.

First, note that 2pÂ² must be even, 3qÂ² must be divisible by 3, 30rÂ² divisible by 30, and 45sÂ² divisible by 45. The total sum is 6. Let's check possible values.

Since 45sÂ² divides the total sum 6, sÂ² must be such that 45sÂ² â¤ 6 â sÂ² â¤ 6/45 = 2/15 â 0.133. But s is integer, so sÂ² must be 0. Hence s = 0. Similarly, 30rÂ² â¤ 6 â rÂ² â¤ 6/30 = 1/5 â rÂ² â¤ 0.2. So rÂ² must be 0, hence r = 0. So now the equation reduces to 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 6.

So now, we have 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 6, with p and q integers, and (q, s) â  (0,0) â q â  0 (since s=0). So q â  0.

Let's solve 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 6. Let's divide both sides by 3: (2/3)pÂ² + qÂ² = 2. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, rearrange: 2pÂ² = 6 - 3qÂ² â pÂ² = (6 - 3qÂ²)/2 = 3(2 - qÂ²)/2. So (6 - 3qÂ²) must be divisible by 2. 6 is 0 mod 2, 3qÂ² is 1*qÂ² mod 2. So 0 - qÂ² â¡ 0 mod 2 â qÂ² â¡ 0 mod 2 â q even. So q must be even. Let q = 2k, where k is integer. Then qÂ² = 4kÂ². Substitute into the equation:

2pÂ² + 3*(4kÂ²) = 6 â 2pÂ² + 12kÂ² = 6 â Divide by 2: pÂ² + 6kÂ² = 3.

Now, pÂ² + 6kÂ² = 3. Let's look for integer solutions. Since pÂ² and 6kÂ² are non-negative, possible values for kÂ²: 0, 1, etc. Let's try k = 0: pÂ² = 3 â p not integer. k = 1: pÂ² = 3 - 6*1 = -3 â no solution. k = -1: same. So no solutions here. Therefore, no integer solutions exist for 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 6.

Wait, so if s and r must be zero, then there are no integer solutions for p and q. Hence, scaling back, there are no rational solutions with denominator 3. But maybe scaling with a different denominator?

Wait, we set a = p/3, b = q/3, etc., but perhaps we need a different scaling factor. Let's consider scaling variables by a factor of m. Let me set a = x/m, b = y/m, c = z/m, d = w/m where x, y, z, w, m are integers, m â  0. Then the equation becomes:

2(x/m)Â² + 3(y/m)Â² + 30(z/m)Â² + 45(w/m)Â² = 2/3

Multiply both sides by mÂ²:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)mÂ²

So similar to earlier. For the left-hand side to be an integer, (2/3)mÂ² must be integer. Therefore, mÂ² must be divisible by 3, so m is divisible by 3. Let m = 3n, then:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)(9nÂ²) = 6nÂ²

So again, 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6nÂ². Then divide both sides by 3:

(2/3)xÂ² + yÂ² + 10zÂ² + 15wÂ² = 2nÂ²

But maybe this isn't helpful. Alternatively, set n as a variable. Let's try to find integer solutions here. Let's see, 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6nÂ². Let's look for small n.

Take n = 1: 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6. Similar to previous equation. Let's check if there are solutions here. Let's try z and w first. 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² â¤ 6 â zÂ² and wÂ² must be 0. So z = 0, w = 0. Then 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² = 6. Which is the same as before. Which has no integer solutions. So n=1: no.

n=2: 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 24. Let's see. Let's try z and w. 30zÂ² +45wÂ² â¤24. Let's see, 30zÂ² â¤24 â zÂ² â¤0.8, so z=0. 45wÂ² â¤24 â wÂ² â¤0.533, so w=0. Then 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=24. So 2xÂ² =24 -3yÂ². 24 -3yÂ² must be even and non-negative. So 24 â¡0 mod2, 3yÂ² â¡ yÂ² mod2. So 0 - yÂ² â¡0 mod2 â yÂ² â¡0 mod2 â y even. Let y=2k. Then 3*(4kÂ²)=12kÂ². 2xÂ²=24 -12kÂ² â xÂ²=12 -6kÂ². 12 -6kÂ² â¥0 â kÂ² â¤2 â k=0,1,-1. Let's try k=0: xÂ²=12 â no. k=1: xÂ²=12 -6=6 â no. k=-1: same. So no solutions.

n=3: 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=54. Let's try z and w. 30zÂ² +45wÂ² â¤54. Let's see, possible values. Let me try w=0: 30zÂ² â¤54 â zÂ² â¤1.8 â z=0,1. If z=0: 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=54. Let y be even, y=2k: 2xÂ² +12kÂ²=54 â xÂ² +6kÂ²=27. Let k=2: xÂ² +24=27 âxÂ²=3. Not integer. k=1: xÂ²=27 -6=21. Not integer. k=0: xÂ²=27. No. z=1: 30*1 +45*0=30. Then 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=24. Which we saw earlier has no solutions. If w=1: 45*1=45. Then 30zÂ² +45*1 â¤54 â30zÂ² â¤9 âzÂ² â¤0.3 âz=0. Then 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=54 -45=9. Let's solve 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=9. Let y be even: y=2k. Then 2xÂ² +12kÂ²=9 âxÂ² +6kÂ²=4.5. Not integer. y odd: y=1: 2xÂ² +3=9 â2xÂ²=6 âxÂ²=3. Not integer. y=-1: same. So no solutions here either.

n=4: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=96. Let's try z and w. 30zÂ² +45wÂ² â¤96. Let's try w=0: 30zÂ² â¤96 âzÂ² â¤3.2 âz=0,1. If z=0: 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=96. Let y=2k: xÂ² +6kÂ²=48. Let k=4: xÂ²=48 -96= -48, nope. k=3: xÂ²=48 -54= -6. Nope. k=2: xÂ²=48 -24=24. No. k=1: xÂ²=48 -6=42. No. k=0: xÂ²=48. No. If z=1: 30*1=30. Then 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=66. Let y=2k: xÂ² +6kÂ²=33. Let k=2: xÂ²=33 -24=9 âx=Â±3. Then y=4. So this gives a solution: x=3, y=4, z=1, w=0, n=4. Wait, let's check: 2*(3)^2 +3*(4)^2 +30*(1)^2 +45*(0)^2 = 2*9 +3*16 +30*1 +0=18 +48 +30=96. Yes! So 96=6*16. Wait, but n=4, so 6nÂ²=6*16=96. So yes, this works.

So we have a solution here: x=3, y=4, z=1, w=0, n=4. Therefore, scaling back to the original variables:

a = x/m = 3/(3n) = 3/(12) = 1/4

b = y/m = 4/12 = 1/3

c = z/m =1/12

d = w/m =0/12 =0

Wait, but d=0 here, but the problem requires (b,d) â  (0,0). In this case, b=1/3 â 0, so it's acceptable. So (a,b,c,d) = (1/4, 1/3, 1/12, 0). Let's check if this satisfies the original equation:

2*(1/4)^2 +3*(1/3)^2 +30*(1/12)^2 +45*(0)^2 = 2*(1/16) +3*(1/9) +30*(1/144) +0 = (1/8) + (1/3) + (5/24)

Convert to 24 denominators:

3/24 + 8/24 +5/24 =16/24=2/3. Yes! It works. So there exists such a solution.

Wait, but in this case, d=0, which is allowed since (b,d)=(1/3,0)â (0,0). So this is a valid solution. Therefore, the answer is yes, such a 4-tuple exists.

But let me verify again. The solution we found is (a,b,c,d)=(1/4,1/3,1/12,0). Let's compute each term:

2aÂ² = 2*(1/4)^2 = 2*(1/16) = 1/8

3bÂ² =3*(1/3)^2 =3*(1/9)=1/3

30cÂ²=30*(1/12)^2=30*(1/144)=5/24

45dÂ²=0

Adding them up: 1/8 +1/3 +5/24. Convert to 24 denominator:

3/24 +8/24 +5/24=16/24=2/3. Perfect. So this works.

Therefore, there exists such a 4-tuple. So the answer is yes.

But wait, just to make sure there's no mistake here. Let's check if all steps are correct.

We scaled variables by m=3n, found integer solutions for x,y,z,w,n, then divided by m to get rational solutions. The key step was finding that for n=4, z=1, w=0, we had a valid solution. Then scaling back gives the rational numbers. Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a simpler solution. Let me try another approach. Suppose I set d=0 and try to solve 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² =2/3. Let's see if there's a solution here.

Let me set c=1/10. Then 30*(1/10)^2 = 30/100 = 3/10. Then 2aÂ² +3bÂ² =2/3 -3/10 =20/30 -9/30=11/30. Then 2aÂ² =11/30 -3bÂ². Let's set b=1/5. Then 3*(1/5)^2=3/25. Then 2aÂ²=11/30 -3/25= (125 - 18)/150=107/150. Then aÂ²=107/300. 107 is prime, so irrational. Not helpful.

Alternatively, set c=1/5. Then 30*(1/5)^2=30/25=6/5. Then 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=2/3 -6/5= (10 -18)/15= -8/15. Negative, so no solution.

Alternatively, set c=1/3. Then 30*(1/3)^2=30/9=10/3. Then 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=2/3 -10/3= -8/3. Negative. Not possible.

Alternatively, set c=1/6. Then 30*(1/6)^2=30/36=5/6. Then 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=2/3 -5/6= (4 -5)/6= -1/6. Still negative.

Alternatively, set dâ 0. For example, set d=1/5. Then 45*(1/5)^2=45/25=9/5. Then 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ²=2/3 -9/5= (10 -27)/15= -17/15. Negative.

Alternatively, set d=1/6. 45*(1/6)^2=45/36=5/4. Then 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ²=2/3 -5/4= (8 -15)/12= -7/12. Still negative.

Alternatively, set c and d both non-zero. Let's say c=1/12 and d=1/12. Then 30*(1/12)^2 +45*(1/12)^2= (30 +45)/144=75/144=25/48. Then 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=2/3 -25/48= (32 -25)/48=7/48. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=7/48. Let's set a=1/8. Then 2*(1/64)=1/32. Then 3bÂ²=7/48 -1/32= (14 -3)/96=11/96 â bÂ²=11/(288). Irrational.

Alternatively, set a=1/12. Then 2*(1/144)=1/72. Then 3bÂ²=7/48 -1/72= (21 -2)/144=19/144 â bÂ²=19/432. Irrational.

Alternatively, set a=1/24. Then 2*(1/576)=1/288. 3bÂ²=7/48 -1/288= (42 -1)/288=41/288 âbÂ²=41/864. Still irrational.

This trial and error isn't working. But earlier, the scaling approach gave us a valid solution. So even though trial and error is messy, the scaling method worked. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But just to be thorough, let's check if the solution (1/4,1/3,1/12,0) is indeed correct. Plugging into the original equation:

2*(1/4)^2 +3*(1/3)^2 +30*(1/12)^2 +45*0^2 = 2*(1/16) +3*(1/9) +30*(1/144) = 1/8 + 1/3 + 5/24.

Convert to 24 denominator:

3/24 +8/24 +5/24=16/24=2/3. Correct. And (b,d)=(1/3,0)â (0,0). So this solution satisfies all conditions.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a 4-tuple exists.

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if there's a 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) where at least one of b or d isn't zero, and when you plug them into the equation 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ², you get 2/3. Hmm. Let me start by understanding the problem better.

First, the equation is a quadratic form in four variables. The question is whether there's a non-trivial solution (since (b, d) â  (0,0)) over the rationals. Quadratic forms over the rationals can sometimes be approached using methods from number theory or linear algebra. Maybe I can try to find a rational solution by scaling the variables or using substitution.

Let me note that the equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Since we're dealing with rational numbers, maybe I can multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator. That would give me 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. But I'm not sure if that helps directly. Alternatively, maybe scaling the variables so that the coefficients become integers. For example, if I let x = a, y = b, z = c, w = d, then the equation is 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 2/3. But the coefficients are still fractions. Maybe multiplying through by 3 gives 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2. Now all coefficients are integers, but the right-hand side is 2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can think of this equation as a Diophantine equation over the rationals. Diophantine equations often have solutions when certain conditions are met, like the Hasse principle, which states that a solution exists over Q if and only if it has solutions over Q_p for all primes p and over R. But I'm not sure if I can apply that here, especially since the equation is a quadratic form. Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the variables. For example, set some variables to zero and see if the remaining equation has a solution. For instance, if I set c = 0 and d = 0, then the equation reduces to 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. Then, maybe solve for a and b. Let's see, 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. Multiply both sides by 3: 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² = 2. Then 3aÂ² + (9/2)bÂ² = 1. Hmm, not sure. Maybe set a = 1, but 3*(1)^2 + (9/2)bÂ² = 1 => (9/2)bÂ² = -2, which is impossible. How about a = 0? Then 3bÂ² = 2/3 => bÂ² = 2/9 => b = Â±â(2)/3, which is irrational. So that doesn't help.

Alternatively, set c = 0 and d â  0. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let me see if I can find rational numbers a, b, d such that this holds. Maybe set a and b to zero? Then 45dÂ² = 2/3 => dÂ² = (2/3)/45 = 2/(135) => d = Â±â(2/135) = Â±â(2)/(15â3) = Â±(â6)/45. Still irrational. Hmm.

Alternatively, set a = 0. Then 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Maybe set c = 0 here as well? Then 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Divide by 3: bÂ² + 15dÂ² = 2/9. Still, solving for b and d, maybe set b = 1/3, then 1/9 + 15dÂ² = 2/9 => 15dÂ² = 1/9 => dÂ² = 1/135 => d = Â±1/(3â15) = Â±â15/(45). Hmm, still irrational. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe set two variables to non-zero and others to zero. For example, set a = 0, c = 0, then 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let me see if I can find rational numbers b and d. Suppose I set b = 1/3, then 3*(1/9) + 45dÂ² = 2/3 => 1/3 + 45dÂ² = 2/3 => 45dÂ² = 1/3 => dÂ² = 1/135 => d = Â±1/(3â15). Still irrational.

Alternatively, set a = 1/3. Then 2*(1/9) + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 => 2/9 + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 => 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 - 2/9 = 4/9. Hmm, 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 4/9. Multiply by 9: 27bÂ² + 270cÂ² + 405dÂ² = 4. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe set variables to fractions. For example, let me try to set a = 1/â3, but that would be irrational. Wait, but we need rational numbers. So a, b, c, d must all be rational. So perhaps scaling the entire equation. Let me think.

Suppose we let a = p/q, b = r/q, c = s/q, d = t/q, where p, q, r, s, t are integers. Then substitute into the equation:

2*(p/q)Â² + 3*(r/q)Â² + 30*(s/q)Â² + 45*(t/q)Â² = 2/3.

Multiply both sides by qÂ²:

2pÂ² + 3rÂ² + 30sÂ² + 45tÂ² = (2/3)qÂ².

But the left side is an integer, and the right side is (2/3)qÂ². So (2/3)qÂ² must be an integer. Therefore, qÂ² must be divisible by 3, so q must be divisible by 3. Let q = 3k, where k is an integer. Then substitute back:

Left side: 2pÂ² + 3rÂ² + 30sÂ² + 45tÂ².

Right side: (2/3)*(9kÂ²) = 6kÂ².

So 2pÂ² + 3rÂ² + 30sÂ² + 45tÂ² = 6kÂ².

Divide both sides by 3:

(2/3)pÂ² + rÂ² + 10sÂ² + 15tÂ² = 2kÂ².

But p, r, s, t, k are integers. Wait, but (2/3)pÂ² is not necessarily an integer. So maybe this approach isn't directly helpful. Alternatively, perhaps set q = 3k, but then the equation becomes 2pÂ² + 3rÂ² + 30sÂ² + 45tÂ² = 6kÂ². Then, we can divide by 3:

(2/3)pÂ² + rÂ² + 10sÂ² + 15tÂ² = 2kÂ².

Still, the term (2/3)pÂ² is fractional unless p is divisible by â(3/2), which isn't rational. So maybe this approach isn't the right way.

Alternatively, maybe think of the equation as a quadratic in variables. For example, fix some variables and solve for others. For example, fix a and b, then solve for c and d. But that might not lead anywhere.

Alternatively, think of the equation as 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let's try to find rational solutions. Let me see if I can parameterize this. Maybe set some variables in terms of others. For example, suppose c and d are zero. Then the equation reduces to 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. Let me see if there are rational solutions here. Let me set a = 1/3, so 2*(1/9) + 3bÂ² = 2/3 => 2/9 + 3bÂ² = 6/9 => 3bÂ² = 4/9 => bÂ² = 4/27 => b = Â±2/(3â3) = Â±2â3/9. Still irrational. Hmm.

Alternatively, set a = 0, then 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let me set b = 1/3, then 3*(1/9) + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 => 1/3 + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 => 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 1/3. Multiply by 3: 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 1. Hmm, 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 1. Let me set c = 1/10, then 90*(1/100) + 135dÂ² = 1 => 0.9 + 135dÂ² = 1 => 135dÂ² = 0.1 => dÂ² = 0.1/135 â 0.0007407, so d â Â±0.0272. Not rational. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe set c = d = 1/15. Then 30*(1/225) + 45*(1/225) = 30/225 + 45/225 = 75/225 = 1/3. So 3bÂ² + 1/3 = 2/3 => 3bÂ² = 1/3 => bÂ² = 1/9 => b = Â±1/3. So then a can be found from 2aÂ² + 3*(1/3)^2 + 30*(1/15)^2 + 45*(1/15)^2 = 2/3. Wait, but if we set c = 1/15 and d = 1/15, then:

2aÂ² + 3*(1/9) + 30*(1/225) + 45*(1/225) = 2/3

Simplify:

2aÂ² + 1/3 + (30 + 45)/225 = 2/3

Which is 2aÂ² + 1/3 + 75/225 = 2/3

But 75/225 = 1/3, so 2aÂ² + 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3

Thus, 2aÂ² + 2/3 = 2/3 => 2aÂ² = 0 => a = 0.

So in this case, a = 0, b = Â±1/3, c = 1/15, d = 1/15. Wait, but does this satisfy the original equation?

Check: 2*(0)^2 + 3*(1/3)^2 + 30*(1/15)^2 + 45*(1/15)^2 = 0 + 3*(1/9) + 30*(1/225) + 45*(1/225)

= 1/3 + (30 + 45)/225 = 1/3 + 75/225 = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. Yes! So this works. Wait, so does that mean (a, b, c, d) = (0, 1/3, 1/15, 1/15) is a solution? But (b, d) = (1/3, 1/15) which is not (0,0), so that satisfies the condition. So there exists such a 4-tuple. Wait, so why am I confused?

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify again. If I set c = 1/15 and d = 1/15, then:

3bÂ² + 30*(1/15)^2 + 45*(1/15)^2 = 3bÂ² + (30 + 45)*(1/225) = 3bÂ² + 75/225 = 3bÂ² + 1/3.

Set this equal to 2/3 - 2aÂ². If a = 0, then 3bÂ² + 1/3 = 2/3 => 3bÂ² = 1/3 => bÂ² = 1/9 => b = Â±1/3. So yes, that works. Therefore, (0, 1/3, 1/15, 1/15) is a solution. But then why did I think this was difficult?

Wait, so even though I didn't find it immediately, this seems to work. Let me check again:

2*(0)^2 + 3*(1/3)^2 + 30*(1/15)^2 + 45*(1/15)^2

= 0 + 3*(1/9) + 30*(1/225) + 45*(1/225)

= 0 + 1/3 + (30 + 45)/225

= 1/3 + 75/225

= 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3. Correct.

So that's a valid solution. Therefore, the answer is yes, such a 4-tuple exists. Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculation? Let me check another way.

Alternatively, let me see if there's a different approach. Suppose we set a = 0, then the equation becomes 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let me factor out 15 from the last two terms: 3bÂ² + 15*(2cÂ² + 3dÂ²) = 2/3. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, set c = d = 1/15. Then 30*(1/15)^2 + 45*(1/15)^2 = 30/225 + 45/225 = 75/225 = 1/3. So 3bÂ² + 1/3 = 2/3 => 3bÂ² = 1/3 => bÂ² = 1/9 => b = Â±1/3. So that works. So that gives a solution. Therefore, the answer is yes.

Wait, so why did I not think of this earlier? Maybe because I was trying more complicated substitutions. But this seems straightforward. So the conclusion is that there exists such a 4-tuple, for example, (0, 1/3, 1/15, 1/15). Therefore, the answer is yes.

But let me check another possible solution. Maybe set a = 1/3, then 2*(1/3)^2 + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. So 2/9 + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 => 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 - 2/9 = 4/9. So 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 4/9. Let me set b = 0, then 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 4/9. Divide by 15: 2cÂ² + 3dÂ² = 4/(9*15) = 4/135. Let me set c = 1/15, then 2*(1/225) + 3dÂ² = 4/135 => 2/225 + 3dÂ² = 4/135 => 3dÂ² = 4/135 - 2/225 = (20/675 - 6/675) = 14/675 => dÂ² = 14/(2025) => d = Â±â14/45. Still irrational. Hmm.

Alternatively, set c = 1/10, then 2*(1/100) + 3dÂ² = 4/135 => 1/50 + 3dÂ² = 4/135 => 3dÂ² = 4/135 - 1/50 = (80/2700 - 54/2700) = 26/2700 = 13/1350 => dÂ² = 13/4050 => d = Â±â13/63.7... Not rational. So maybe that approach doesn't work.

But going back to the first solution, which works. So the answer is yes. Therefore, the existence is established.

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if there's a 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) where (b, d) isn't both zero, and they satisfy the equation 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let me understand the problem. We need to find rational numbers a, b, c, d (not all zeros for b and d) such that when we plug them into this quadratic form, we get 2/3. The challenge here is dealing with the fractions and the fact that all coefficients are different. Also, since we need rational solutions, maybe scaling or some substitution could help.

Let me think about how to approach this. Maybe I can start by scaling the variables to eliminate denominators. If I set variables as fractions over a common denominator, maybe I can convert the equation into integers. Let's see. Let me denote a = x/k, b = y/k, c = z/k, d = w/k where x, y, z, w, k are integers. Then, substituting into the equation:

2(x/k)Â² + 3(y/k)Â² + 30(z/k)Â² + 45(w/k)Â² = 2/3

Multiplying both sides by kÂ²:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)kÂ²

But the left side is an integer because x, y, z, w, k are integers. The right side is (2/3)kÂ², which needs to be an integer. Therefore, 3 divides 2kÂ². Since 2 and 3 are coprime, 3 must divide kÂ², which implies 3 divides k. Let k = 3m where m is an integer. Then, the equation becomes:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 2/3*(9mÂ²) = 6mÂ²

So now, we have:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6mÂ²

Simplifying, divide both sides by 3:

(2/3)xÂ² + yÂ² + 10zÂ² + 15wÂ² = 2mÂ²

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let's consider the original equation again:

2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3

Since we want rational solutions, maybe set a, b, c, d as fractions with denominator n, so that we can clear denominators. Let me set a = p/n, b = q/n, c = r/n, d = s/n where p, q, r, s, n are integers, n â  0. Then substituting:

2(p/n)Â² + 3(q/n)Â² + 30(r/n)Â² + 45(s/n)Â² = 2/3

Multiply both sides by nÂ²:

2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = (2/3)nÂ²

Again, the left side is an integer, so the right side must be as well. Therefore, (2/3)nÂ² must be integer, which implies 3 divides 2nÂ². Since 2 and 3 are coprime, 3 divides nÂ², so 3 divides n. Let n = 3k, so:

2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = (2/3)(9kÂ²) = 6kÂ²

Same as before. So, 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6kÂ²

Maybe divide both sides by 2:

pÂ² + (3/2)qÂ² + 15rÂ² + (45/2)sÂ² = 3kÂ²

Hmm, still fractions. Maybe scaling differently. Let's see. Let me consider the equation modulo some number to see if there are solutions. For example, modulo 3.

Looking at the original equation: 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3

But working modulo 3 might be tricky because of the 2/3 on the right. Alternatively, scaling both sides to eliminate denominators. Let's multiply both sides by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

3*(2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ²) = 2

So 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2

Now, working with integers here. Let me denote a, b, c, d as integers again. Wait, but the original problem allows them to be rational. Maybe we need to find integer solutions to this equation, and then scale back. But since a, b, c, d can be rational, perhaps we need to find rational solutions. However, scaling might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe use the Hasse principle or other methods from the theory of quadratic forms. But I'm not sure about that. Let me think.

Alternatively, try to find a simple solution. Suppose we set c = 0 and d = 0. Then the equation reduces to 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. But (b, d) is (0, 0), which is not allowed. So need at least one of b or d non-zero. Let's try setting d = 0. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² = 2/3. Maybe set c = 0 as well. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. But then (b, d) = (b, 0). If b â  0, then we can set a = 0. Then 3bÂ² = 2/3 â bÂ² = 2/9 â b = Â±â(2)/3, which is irrational. So not rational. So if c = 0 and d = 0, the only solution is a = sqrt(1/3), but that's irrational. So maybe need to have non-zero c or d.

Alternatively, set a = 0. Then the equation becomes 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Again, maybe set c = 0. Then 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 â bÂ² + 15dÂ² = 2/9. Let's set d = 1/3. Then 15*(1/9) = 5/3. So 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 5/3 = -1. Which is impossible. Hmm.

Alternatively, set b and d to be non-zero. Maybe try to find a combination where variables can be scaled. Let me try to find a non-trivial solution. Suppose we set a, c to be zero. Then the equation becomes 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let me divide by 3: bÂ² + 15dÂ² = 2/9. Let me set d = 1/3. Then 15*(1/9) = 5/3, so bÂ² = 2/9 - 5/3 = (2 - 15)/9 = -13/9. Not possible. How about d = 1/6? Then 15*(1/36) = 15/36 = 5/12. So bÂ² = 2/9 - 5/12 = (8/36 - 15/36) = -7/36. Still negative. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe set a non-zero. Let me think. Let's consider scaling variables. Suppose I set a = k, b = m, c = n, d = p where k, m, n, p are integers. Wait, but then the equation would have to hold over integers. But the right-hand side is 2/3, which is not an integer. So scaling variables by denominators might help. Wait, maybe if I set variables as fractions with denominator 3. Let me try setting a = p/3, b = q/3, c = r/3, d = s/3. Then substituting into the equation:

2*(p/3)Â² + 3*(q/3)Â² + 30*(r/3)Â² + 45*(s/3)Â² = 2/3

Simplify:

2*(pÂ²/9) + 3*(qÂ²/9) + 30*(rÂ²/9) + 45*(sÂ²/9) = 2/3

Multiply through:

(2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ²)/9 = 2/3

Multiply both sides by 9:

2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6

So now, we need integer solutions to 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6, with (q, s) â  (0, 0). Let's see if we can find integers p, q, r, s satisfying this.

Let me see. Let's try small integers. Let's first set r = 0 and s = 0. Then the equation becomes 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 6. We can divide by 3: (2/3)pÂ² + qÂ² = 2. Not sure. Let's try q = 1. Then 2/3 pÂ² + 1 = 2 â 2/3 pÂ² = 1 â pÂ² = 3/2 â p irrational. q = 0: 2pÂ² = 6 â pÂ² = 3 â p irrational. q = 2: 2/3 pÂ² + 4 = 2 â 2/3 pÂ² = -2 â impossible. So no solutions here with r = s = 0.

Now, try s = 1. Then 45sÂ² = 45*1 = 45. So equation becomes 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² = 6 - 45 = -39. Negative, impossible. Similarly, s = -1 is same. So s must be 0. Wait, but s = 0 is allowed? Wait, but we need (q, s) â  (0, 0). So if s = 0, then q must be non-zero. Wait, but even if s = 0, we can have q â  0, but earlier when s = 0, r = 0, the equation didn't have solutions. What if we set r â  0?

Let's try r = 1. Then 30rÂ² = 30. So equation becomes 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6 - 30 = -24. Negative, impossible. Similarly, r = -1 same. So r must be 0. So the only possible non-zero variables are q and s. But when s = 0, we have 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 6, which doesn't have rational solutions as before. Wait, but maybe if we set p, q, r, s as fractions? Wait, but we scaled variables to get to integers. So if we can find integer solutions to 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6, then scaling back would give us rational solutions. But so far, we haven't found any.

Alternatively, maybe set two variables non-zero. Let's try q and s. Let's set r = 0. Then equation becomes 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6. Let me set s = 1. Then 45sÂ² = 45. So 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = -39. Impossible. s = 0, then 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 6. As before. If s = 1/3, but s must be integer in our scaled equation. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, when we scaled variables by 3, we set a = p/3, b = q/3, etc., so p, q, r, s are integers, but in the original problem, a, b, c, d are rational. So if we can find integers p, q, r, s such that 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6, then (a, b, c, d) = (p/3, q/3, r/3, s/3) would be a solution. So we need to check if such integers exist.

Let me try small integers. Let's check if there are any solutions where all variables are 0 except some combination.

Case 1: Only q non-zero. Then 3qÂ² = 6 â qÂ² = 2 â q irrational. Not allowed.

Case 2: Only s non-zero. 45sÂ² = 6 â sÂ² = 6/45 = 2/15 â s irrational.

Case 3: Only p non-zero. 2pÂ² = 6 â pÂ² = 3 â p irrational.

Case 4: p and q non-zero. 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 6. Let's see possible integer solutions. Let p = 1: 2 + 3qÂ² = 6 â 3qÂ² = 4 â qÂ² = 4/3 â q irrational. p = 2: 8 + 3qÂ² = 6 â 3qÂ² = -2 â impossible. p = 0: 3qÂ² = 6 â qÂ² = 2 â same as before.

Case 5: p and s non-zero. 2pÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6. Let s = 1: 2pÂ² = 6 - 45 = -39 â impossible. s = 0: same as p only. s = 1/3: but s must be integer. So no.

Case 6: q and s non-zero. 3qÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6. Divide by 3: qÂ² + 15sÂ² = 2. Let s = 0: qÂ² = 2 â nope. s = 1: qÂ² = 2 - 15 = -13 â impossible.

Case 7: p, q, s non-zero. 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6. Let s = 1: 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = -39 â impossible. s = 0: same as case 4. s = -1 same as above.

Case 8: p, r, s non-zero. 2pÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6. Let r = 1: 2pÂ² + 30 + 45sÂ² = 6 â 2pÂ² + 45sÂ² = -24 â impossible. r = -1 same.

Case 9: q, r, s non-zero. 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6. Let r = 1: 3qÂ² + 30 + 45sÂ² = 6 â 3qÂ² + 45sÂ² = -24 â impossible.

Case 10: All variables non-zero. For example, p, q, r, s all non-zero. But even if they are, the equation is 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6. Since all terms are positive, each term must be less than 6. Let's see:

2pÂ² < 6 â pÂ² < 3 â p = -1, 0, 1

3qÂ² < 6 â qÂ² < 2 â q = -1, 0, 1

30rÂ² < 6 â rÂ² < 1/5 â r = 0

45sÂ² < 6 â sÂ² < 2/15 â s = 0

So only p and q can be non-zero. But we already saw that 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 6 has no integer solutions. So no solutions in integers.

Therefore, scaling back, there are no solutions in integers p, q, r, s. Hence, no rational solutions? Wait, but maybe I missed something. Wait, maybe the scaling approach is not sufficient? Or perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the equation can be scaled to integers, and if there are no integer solutions, then there are no rational solutions. But is that true?

In general, for quadratic forms, if you can scale the variables to make the equation have integer coefficients, then the existence of rational solutions is equivalent to the existence of integer solutions (by scaling). So if there are no integer solutions, then there are no rational solutions. But in our case, we scaled the original equation by 3 to get rid of denominators, leading to 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. Then, by setting a, b, c, d as integers, we saw that there are no solutions. Therefore, there are no rational solutions? But wait, maybe the scaling factor is different. Let me check.

Wait, the original equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. If we set a = x/k, b = y/k, c = z/k, d = w/k where x, y, z, w, k are integers, then multiplying both sides by kÂ² gives 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)kÂ². Then, as before, 3 divides kÂ², so k = 3m. Then, substituting back, 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6mÂ². So we have to solve 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6mÂ². If there are no integer solutions to this equation with (y, w) â  (0, 0), then there are no rational solutions. But how do we know if there are integer solutions?

Alternatively, maybe use a descent method. Suppose there is a non-trivial solution. Then, perhaps we can find a smaller solution, leading to a contradiction. Let's assume there is a solution with minimal |k|. But this might be complicated.

Alternatively, consider the equation modulo 3. Let's look at the equation 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Multiply both sides by 3 to get 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. Now, consider this equation modulo 3:

6aÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3,

9bÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3,

90cÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3,

135dÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3,

So left side â¡ 0 mod 3, right side â¡ 2 mod 3. Contradiction. Therefore, there are no solutions. Wait, that's a key point!

Wait, if we multiply both sides by 3, we get 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. Then, modulo 3, all terms on the left are multiples of 3, so left side â¡ 0 mod 3. But 2 â¡ 2 mod 3 â  0 mod 3. Therefore, there are no solutions in integers, hence no rational solutions. Therefore, the answer is no, such a 4-tuple does not exist.

But wait, let me verify this again. The original equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Multiplying both sides by 3 gives 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. Then, modulo 3, each term:

6aÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3,

9bÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3,

90cÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3 (since 90 = 3*30),

135dÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3 (since 135 = 3*45),

So left side â¡ 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 â¡ 0 mod 3. Right side is 2 mod 3. Therefore, 0 â¡ 2 mod 3, which is false. Therefore, there are no solutions in rational numbers. Therefore, the answer is no.

Wait, but is this correct? Because if we have rational solutions, then multiplying by denominators squared should give integers. But in this case, multiplying by 3 gives a non-integer equation modulo 3. Therefore, there are no solutions. Therefore, the answer is no, such a 4-tuple does not exist.

But let me check once more. Suppose someone claims there is a solution. For example, take a = 1/â3, b = 0, c = 0, d = 0. Then 2*(1/3) + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2/3. But (b, d) = (0, 0), which is not allowed. So that's invalid. Another example: set b = 1/â3, a = 0, c = 0, d = 0. Then 3*(1/3) = 1, which is not 2/3. So that's not right. How about mixing terms? Suppose a, b, c, d are fractions with denominator â3. For example, a = 1/â3, b = 1/â3. Then 2*(1/3) + 3*(1/3) + 0 + 0 = 2/3 + 1 = 5/3 > 2/3. Not good. If a = 1/â3, c = 1/â3. Then 2*(1/3) + 0 + 30*(1/3) + 0 = 2/3 + 10 = 32/3 > 2/3. Nope.

Alternatively, think about scaling variables. Suppose we set a = x, b = y, c = z, d = w, all rational. Then the equation is 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 2/3. Let me multiply both sides by 3 to get 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2. Now, the left-hand side is 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ². Each term is divisible by 3 except 6xÂ², which is 6xÂ² = 3*2xÂ². So the entire left-hand side is divisible by 3, but the right-hand side is 2, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, there are no solutions. Hence, no such rational numbers exist.

Therefore, the answer is that no such 4-tuple exists.

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if there's a 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) where (b, d) isn't both zero, and they satisfy the equation 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the equation is a quadratic form in four variables. The coefficients are 2, 3, 30, and 45 for aÂ², bÂ², cÂ², dÂ² respectively. The question is whether there exist non-trivial rational solutions (since (b, d) â  (0,0)) to this equation. 

Wait, but actually, (a, c) could also be zero, right? The only condition is that (b, d) isn't both zero. So even if a or c are zero, as long as at least one of b or d is non-zero, it's okay. So maybe I can try to find solutions where b and d are non-zero, and a and c might be zero or not. Let me see.

Let me first think about whether this equation has any non-trivial solutions. Maybe I can try to reduce the problem. Since we're dealing with rational numbers, maybe scaling variables could help. Let me consider substituting variables with fractions. Let me set a = p/m, b = q/m, c = r/m, d = s/m, where p, q, r, s, m are integers, and m â  0. Then the equation becomes 2(p/m)Â² + 3(q/m)Â² + 30(r/m)Â² + 45(s/m)Â² = 2. Multiplying both sides by mÂ² gives 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 2mÂ². So we need integers p, q, r, s, m such that 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 2mÂ², and m is non-zero. Also, since (b, d) â  (0, 0), then (q, s) â  (0, 0).

So now the problem is transformed into finding integers p, q, r, s, m with m â  0, and (q, s) â  (0, 0), such that 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 2mÂ². Then, scaling back, (a, b, c, d) = (p/m, q/m, r/m, s/m) would be a rational solution.

So, perhaps I can look for integer solutions first? If such integer solutions exist, then scaling them by 1/m would give rational solutions. Alternatively, maybe we can consider the equation modulo some primes to see if solutions exist. Let's try that approach.

First, let's consider the equation modulo 3. Let's see:

The equation is 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 2mÂ².

Modulo 3, the coefficients become:

2pÂ² + 0 + 0 + 0 â¡ 2mÂ² mod 3.

So 2pÂ² â¡ 2mÂ² mod 3.

Dividing both sides by 2 (since 2 is invertible modulo 3), we get pÂ² â¡ mÂ² mod 3. So (p - m)(p + m) â¡ 0 mod 3. Therefore, either p â¡ m mod 3 or p â¡ -m mod 3. So this gives us some condition on p and m.

But this might not be immediately helpful. Let's try another prime. How about modulo 5?

Looking at the equation modulo 5:

The equation is 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 2mÂ².

Modulo 5, 30 â¡ 0 and 45 â¡ 0, so the equation reduces to 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² â¡ 2mÂ² mod 5.

So 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² â¡ 2mÂ² mod 5.

Let me see what possible values pÂ², qÂ², mÂ² can take modulo 5. Squares modulo 5 are 0, 1, 4.

So let's consider all possible combinations.

Let me denote x = pÂ² mod 5, y = qÂ² mod 5, z = mÂ² mod 5.

Then, the equation becomes 2x + 3y â¡ 2z mod 5.

Let me check possible x, y, z in {0,1,4}.

Case 1: x = 0.

Then 0 + 3y â¡ 2z mod 5 â 3y â¡ 2z mod 5. Let's see possible y:

If y = 0: 0 â¡ 2z â z â¡ 0 mod 5.

If y = 1: 3 â¡ 2z â 2z â¡ 3 â z â¡ 4 mod 5 (since 2*4=8â¡3 mod5).

If y = 4: 12 â¡ 2z â 2z â¡ 12 â¡ 2 mod5 â z â¡1 mod5.

Case 2: x =1.

Then 2 +3y â¡2z mod5 â3y â¡2z -2 mod5.

If y=0: 0 â¡2z -2 â2z â¡2 âzâ¡1 mod5.

If y=1:3 â¡2z -2 â2zâ¡5â¡0 âzâ¡0 mod5.

If y=4:12â¡2z -2 â2zâ¡14â¡4 mod5 âzâ¡2 mod5. But z is a square mod5, so z can only be 0,1,4. So z=2 is impossible. So no solution here.

Case3: x=4.

Then 8 +3y â¡2z mod5 â3 +3y â¡2z mod5 â3y â¡2z -3 mod5.

If y=0:0â¡2z -3â2zâ¡3âzâ¡4 mod5.

If y=1:3â¡2z -3â2zâ¡6â¡1âzâ¡3 mod5. Not possible.

If y=4:12â¡2z -3â2zâ¡15â¡0âzâ¡0 mod5.

So compiling all possible solutions:

Case1: x=0

- y=0, z=0

- y=1, z=4

- y=4, z=1

Case2: x=1

- y=0, z=1

- y=1, z=0

Case3: x=4

- y=0, z=4

- y=4, z=0

So these are the possible combinations. So for the equation to have solutions modulo5, these combinations must hold. Let's see if there's a way to get a contradiction here.

But maybe this is getting too complicated. Let me try to approach it differently. Maybe try to find specific solutions.

Suppose we set c = 0 and d = 0. Then the equation reduces to 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2. But then (b,d) = (b,0), so b â 0. So we can set b â 0. Let me check if 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2 has rational solutions with b â 0.

Let me set a = 0. Then 3bÂ² = 2 â bÂ² = 2/3 â b = Â±â(2/3). But â(2/3) is irrational, so a=0 is not possible unless we allow irrational numbers. But the question is about rational solutions, so a=0 and b=Â±â(2/3) is not rational. So no solution here.

Alternatively, if a â 0, can we find rational numbers a and b such that 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2? Let me try to parametrize this equation.

Suppose we set b = 1. Then 2aÂ² + 3*1 = 2 â 2aÂ² = -1, which is impossible. So b can't be 1. Wait, but maybe b is a fraction. Let me set b = k, some rational number. Then 2aÂ² = 2 - 3kÂ² â aÂ² = (2 - 3kÂ²)/2. So a must be real only if 2 -3kÂ² â¥0 â kÂ² â¤ 2/3 â |k| â¤ sqrt(2/3) â 0.816. So k can be rational numbers between -0.816 and 0.816. Let's try k=1/2. Then aÂ² = (2 - 3*(1/4))/2 = (2 - 3/4)/2 = (5/4)/2 = 5/8. So a = Â±â(5/8) = Â±(â10)/4, which is irrational. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe set a = 1. Then 2*1 + 3bÂ² = 2 â 3bÂ² = 0 â b=0. But then (b,d)=(0,0), which is not allowed. So not helpful.

Alternatively, set a = m/n, b = p/q, with m,n,p,q integers. Then 2(m/n)^2 + 3(p/q)^2 = 2. Multiply both sides by nÂ²qÂ²: 2mÂ²qÂ² + 3pÂ²nÂ² = 2nÂ²qÂ². Rearranged: 2mÂ²qÂ² + 3pÂ²nÂ² - 2nÂ²qÂ² =0. Not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, maybe look for solutions where a and b are both rational. Let me try to set b = 1/t for some integer t. Then 2aÂ² + 3(1/tÂ²) = 2. Then 2aÂ² = 2 - 3/tÂ² â aÂ² = (2tÂ² -3)/2tÂ². For a to be rational, (2tÂ² -3)/2tÂ² must be a square of a rational number. Let me set t=1: aÂ²=(2 -3)/2= (-1)/2, invalid. t=2: aÂ²=(8 -3)/8=5/8, which is not a square. t=3: aÂ²=(18 -3)/18=15/18=5/6, not a square. t=4: (32 -3)/32=29/32, not a square. t=5: (50 -3)/50=47/50, nope. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using Pythagorean triples? Let me think. Suppose we have 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2. Let me set a = x, b = y. Then 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² = 2. Let me see if there's a way to parametrize this. If I solve for x in terms of y: xÂ² = (2 - 3yÂ²)/2. For x to be rational, 2 - 3yÂ² must be a square of a rational number times 2. Let me set y = q/m, then xÂ² = (2 - 3qÂ²/mÂ²)/2 = (2mÂ² -3qÂ²)/(2mÂ²). So x = Â±â(2mÂ² -3qÂ²)/(mâ2). For x to be rational, 2mÂ² -3qÂ² must be a perfect square. Let me set 2mÂ² -3qÂ² = kÂ². So 2mÂ² = kÂ² + 3qÂ². This is a Diophantine equation. Hmm, maybe there are solutions here.

Looking for integers m, q, k such that 2mÂ² = kÂ² + 3qÂ². Let's try small integers.

Let me try m=1: 2 = kÂ² +3qÂ². Possible kÂ²: 0,1, but 3qÂ² would have to be 2 or 1. Both not divisible by 3. So no solution.

m=2: 8 = kÂ² +3qÂ². Let's see possible kÂ²: 0,1,4, so 3qÂ²=8,5,4. 3qÂ²=8 â qÂ²=8/3, nope. 3qÂ²=5 â nope. 3qÂ²=4 â qÂ²=4/3. No.

m=3: 18 = kÂ² +3qÂ². So 3qÂ²=18 -kÂ². So kÂ² must be divisible by 3, so k=3p. Then 3qÂ²=18 -9pÂ² â qÂ²=6 -3pÂ². So 6 -3pÂ² must be a square. 6 -3pÂ² â¥0 â pÂ² â¤2 â p=0,1.

p=0: qÂ²=6 â nope.

p=1: qÂ²=6 -3=3 â nope.

m=4: 32 =kÂ² +3qÂ². So kÂ²=32 -3qÂ². Let's check possible qÂ²: 0,1,4,9,16.

If qÂ²=0: kÂ²=32 â nope.

qÂ²=1: kÂ²=32-3=29 â nope.

qÂ²=4: kÂ²=32-12=20 â nope.

qÂ²=9: kÂ²=32-27=5 â nope.

qÂ²=16: kÂ²=32-48=-16 â nope.

No solutions here.

m=5: 50=kÂ² +3qÂ². So kÂ²=50 -3qÂ². Check qÂ²:

qÂ²=0: kÂ²=50 â nope.

qÂ²=1: 47 â nope.

qÂ²=4: 50-12=38 â nope.

qÂ²=9:50-27=23ânope.

qÂ²=16:50-48=2ânope.

qÂ²=25:50-75=-25ânope.

No luck. Maybe m=6: 72=kÂ² +3qÂ².

kÂ²=72 -3qÂ². Let's try qÂ²=0:72ânope.

qÂ²=1:69ânope.

qÂ²=4:60ânope.

qÂ²=9:51ânope.

qÂ²=16:24ânope.

qÂ²=25:72-75=-3ânope.

qÂ²=36:72-108=-36ânope.

Still nothing. Maybe m=7: 98=kÂ² +3qÂ².

kÂ²=98 -3qÂ². Let's check qÂ²:

qÂ²=0:98ânope.

qÂ²=1:95ânope.

qÂ²=4:98-12=86ânope.

qÂ²=9:98-27=71ânope.

qÂ²=16:98-48=50ânope.

qÂ²=25:98-75=23ânope.

qÂ²=36:98-108=-10ânope.

qÂ²=49:98-147=-49ânope.

Not working. Maybe this approach isn't fruitful. Let me try another angle.

Suppose we consider the entire equation 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2. Maybe set some variables to zero. For example, set a=0 and c=0. Then the equation becomes 3bÂ² +45dÂ²=2. Then 3(bÂ² +15dÂ²)=2. So bÂ² +15dÂ²=2/3. But since b and d are rational, let's set b = p/m and d = q/m, so (p/m)^2 +15(q/m)^2=2/3. Multiply by mÂ²: pÂ² +15qÂ²= (2/3)mÂ². So 3pÂ² +45qÂ²=2mÂ². So we need integers p, q, m with 3pÂ² +45qÂ²=2mÂ². Let's see if this is possible.

Divide both sides by 3: pÂ² +15qÂ²= (2/3)mÂ². But mÂ² must be divisible by 3, so m=3k. Then pÂ² +15qÂ²= 2*(9kÂ²)/3=6kÂ². So pÂ² +15qÂ²=6kÂ². Now, look for integers p, q, k such that pÂ²=6kÂ² -15qÂ². Let's try small k:

k=1: pÂ²=6 -15qÂ². So 6 -15qÂ² must be a square. 6 -15qÂ² â¥0 â qÂ² â¤6/15=2/5. So q=0: pÂ²=6 â nope. q=1: 6 -15= -9 â nope. So no solution.

k=2: pÂ²=24 -15qÂ². Let's see:

q=0: pÂ²=24 â nope.

q=1:24 -15=9 â p=Â±3. So p=3, q=1, k=2. Then m=3*2=6. So p=3, q=1, m=6. Then b=p/m=3/6=1/2, d=q/m=1/6. Then check: 3*(1/2)^2 +45*(1/6)^2=3*(1/4) +45*(1/36)= 3/4 +45/36= 3/4 +5/4=8/4=2. Yes! So (a,b,c,d)=(0,1/2,0,1/6) is a solution. Wait, but in this case, a=0, c=0, so (b,d)=(1/2,1/6)â (0,0). So this is a valid solution. Therefore, there exists such a 4-tuple.

Wait, so this seems to work. Let me verify:

Compute 2*(0)^2 +3*(1/2)^2 +30*(0)^2 +45*(1/6)^2.

3*(1/4) +45*(1/36) = 3/4 + 45/36 = 3/4 + 5/4 = 8/4 = 2. Yes, that's correct. So (0, 1/2, 0, 1/6) is indeed a solution. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. If I set a=0, c=0, then 3bÂ² +45dÂ²=2. Then setting b=1/2 and d=1/6 gives 3*(1/4) +45*(1/36)= 3/4 +5/4=2. Correct. So that works. Therefore, such a 4-tuple exists.

But let me check if I considered all possibilities. The original equation is in four variables. By setting a and c to zero, I reduced it to two variables, found a solution. Therefore, even though the problem is in four variables, there exists a solution with a and c zero. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there's another solution where more variables are non-zero. For example, maybe a non-zero. Let's see. Suppose we set a non-zero. Let's try to find another solution.

Suppose a=1. Then 2*1 +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2 â 3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=0. Which implies b=c=d=0, but (b,d)=(0,0), which is not allowed. So that's not possible.

Alternatively, set a=1/2. Then 2*(1/2)^2 +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2 â 2*(1/4) +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2 â 0.5 +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2 â 3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=1.5. Multiply by 2: 6bÂ² +60cÂ² +90dÂ²=3 â 2bÂ² +20cÂ² +30dÂ²=1. Then we need 2bÂ² +20cÂ² +30dÂ²=1 with (b,d)â (0,0). Let's try b=1/2, d=1/6. Then 2*(1/4) +20cÂ² +30*(1/36)= 0.5 +20cÂ² +30/36=0.5 +20cÂ² +0.833...=1.333... +20cÂ²=1. So 20cÂ²= -0.333..., which is impossible. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, set b=1/3, d=1/9. Then 2*(1/3)^2 +20cÂ² +30*(1/9)^2=2*(1/9) +20cÂ² +30*(1/81)=2/9 +20cÂ² +10/27= (6/27 + 10/27) +20cÂ²=16/27 +20cÂ²=1 â20cÂ²=11/27 âcÂ²=11/(27*20)=11/540. Not a square.

Alternatively, set c non-zero. Let's set c=1/â30. Then 30*(1/â30)^2=1. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +1 +45dÂ²=2 â2aÂ² +3bÂ² +45dÂ²=1. Let's set d=1/â45. Then 45dÂ²=1. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +1=1 â2aÂ² +3bÂ²=0 âa=b=0. But then (b,d)=(0,1/â45)â (0,0), but a=0. So (0,0,1/â30,1/â45) is a solution. But these are irrational numbers. However, we need rational solutions. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, set c=1/6. Then 30*(1/6)^2=30*(1/36)=5/6. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +5/6 +45dÂ²=2 â2aÂ² +3bÂ² +45dÂ²=7/6. Let me set d=1/6. Then 45*(1/6)^2=45*(1/36)=5/4. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +5/4=7/6 â2aÂ² +3bÂ²=7/6 -5/4=14/12 -15/12= -1/12. Not possible.

Alternatively, set d=1/12. Then 45*(1/12)^2=45*(1/144)=5/16. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +5/16=7/6 â2aÂ² +3bÂ²=7/6 -5/16=56/96 -30/96=26/96=13/48. So 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=13/48. Let me set b=1/4. Then 3*(1/16)=3/16. So 2aÂ²=13/48 -3/16=13/48 -9/48=4/48=1/12 âaÂ²=1/24 âa=Â±1/(2â6). Irrational. Not helpful.

Alternatively, set a=1/4. Then 2*(1/16)=1/8. So 1/8 +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2 â3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=15/8. Let me set b=1/4. Then 3*(1/16)=3/16. So 30cÂ² +45dÂ²=15/8 -3/16=30/16 -3/16=27/16. Then 30cÂ² +45dÂ²=27/16. Divide by 3:10cÂ² +15dÂ²=9/16. Let me set d=1/4. Then 15*(1/16)=15/16. So 10cÂ²=9/16 -15/16= -6/16 â invalid.

Hmm, this approach isn't working. Maybe the solution I found earlier with a=0 and c=0 is the easiest. So since that works, there exists such a 4-tuple. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But let me check if there's a mistake in my earlier reasoning. When I set a=0 and c=0, I got b=1/2 and d=1/6. Both are rational, and (b,d)â (0,0). So that's valid. Therefore, such a 4-tuple exists. Therefore, the answer is yes.

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

","Okay, so I need to determine if there's a 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) where (b, d) isn't (0,0), and they satisfy the equation 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, the equation is a quadratic form in four variables. Rational solutions... Maybe I can start by scaling variables to make the equation simpler. Since all coefficients are integers, maybe multiplying through by 3 to eliminate denominators? Let's see:

Original equation: 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3.

Multiply both sides by 3: 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2.

Now the equation is 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2, and we need a, b, c, d to be rational with (b, d) â  (0,0). So maybe I can look for rational solutions here.

Alternatively, perhaps consider rational solutions as fractions. Let me set a = p/q, b = r/q, c = s/q, d = t/q where p, r, s, t, q are integers, and q â  0. Then substituting into the equation:

6(pÂ²/qÂ²) + 9(rÂ²/qÂ²) + 90(sÂ²/qÂ²) + 135(tÂ²/qÂ²) = 2.

Multiply both sides by qÂ²: 6pÂ² + 9rÂ² + 90sÂ² + 135tÂ² = 2qÂ².

So we have 6pÂ² + 9rÂ² + 90sÂ² + 135tÂ² = 2qÂ². All variables integers, q â  0. So we need integer solutions to this equation where (r, t) â  (0,0).

Alternatively, maybe try to find small integer solutions. Let's see. Let's try some small integers.

But this might be time-consuming. Alternatively, maybe check if the equation can be satisfied by some rational numbers. Let's think about scaling.

Suppose we set c = 0 and d = 0, then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. Then, 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. Let's see if there are rational solutions here with b â  0.

Let me set b = 1. Then 2aÂ² + 3(1)^2 = 2/3 â 2aÂ² = 2/3 - 3 = 2/3 - 9/3 = -7/3. That's negative, so no real solutions. So b can't be 1. Maybe b = 1/3? Then 3*(1/3)^2 = 3*(1/9) = 1/3. Then 2aÂ² = 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3 â aÂ² = 1/6 â a = Â±1/â6. But â6 is irrational, so a would be irrational. But we need a to be rational. So that doesn't work.

Alternatively, set a = 0. Then 3bÂ² = 2/3 â bÂ² = 2/9 â b = Â±â(2)/3. Again, irrational. So if c and d are zero, there's no solution. So we need at least one of c or d non-zero.

But maybe if we take c and d non-zero, we can balance the equation. Let's try some specific values.

Suppose c = 1 and d = 1. Then 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 30 + 45 = 75. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 75 = 2/3 - 225/3 = -223/3. Negative, so no solution.

If we take c = 1 and d = 0, then 30*1 + 45*0 = 30. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 30 = -88/3. Still negative. Similarly, c = 0 and d = 1, 45*1 = 45. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 45 = -133/3. Negative again.

So maybe c and d need to be fractions. Let's try c = 1/â30 and d = 1/â45. Wait, but they need to be rational. Let me try c = 1/k and d = 1/m where k and m are integers. Then 30*(1/kÂ²) + 45*(1/mÂ²). Let's see. For example, k = 5, m = 3. Then 30/25 + 45/9 = 1.2 + 5 = 6.2. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 6.2 = negative. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe c and d are small fractions. Let's try c = 1/5, d = 1/5. Then 30*(1/25) + 45*(1/25) = (30 + 45)/25 = 75/25 = 3. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 3 = -7/3. Still negative.

Hmm. Maybe we need both c and d to be fractions such that 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² is less than 2/3. Let's see. 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² â¤ 2/3. So cÂ² â¤ (2/3 - 45dÂ²)/30. For example, let's set d = 0. Then cÂ² â¤ (2/3)/30 = 1/45 â 0.0222. So c â¤ 1/â45 â 0.149. So if c is 1/7, then cÂ² = 1/49 â 0.0204. Then 30cÂ² = 30/49 â 0.612. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 - 30/49 â 0.6667 - 0.612 â 0.0547. So 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² â 0.0547. Then 3bÂ² â¤ 0.0547 â bÂ² â¤ 0.0182 â |b| â¤ 0.135. So b can be 1/8, 1/9, etc. Let's try b = 1/9. Then 3*(1/81) = 1/27 â 0.037. Then 2aÂ² = 0.0547 - 0.037 â 0.0177 â aÂ² â 0.00885 â a â Â±0.094. So a could be 1/11 â 0.0909. Let's check 2*(1/11)^2 + 3*(1/9)^2 + 30*(1/7)^2. Compute each term:

2*(1/121) â 0.0165, 3*(1/81) â 0.037, 30*(1/49) â 0.612. Total â 0.0165 + 0.037 + 0.612 â 0.6655, which is close to 2/3 â 0.6667. But it's not exact. So maybe with exact fractions:

2*(1/11)^2 + 3*(1/9)^2 + 30*(1/7)^2 = 2/121 + 3/81 + 30/49. Compute as fractions:

2/121 + 1/27 + 30/49. To add these, find common denominators. Let's compute each term:

2/121 â 0.0165, 1/27 â 0.0370, 30/49 â 0.6122. Sum â 0.6657, which is approximately 2/3 â 0.6667. Close, but not exact. So maybe with another set of fractions.

Alternatively, let's try to set c and d such that 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² is exactly 2/3. Then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 0, which would imply a = b = 0. But then (b, d) would be (0, d). If d â  0, then (b, d) = (0, d) â  (0,0). Wait, but if 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3, then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 0 â a = b = 0. So then (a, b, c, d) = (0, 0, c, d). But (b, d) = (0, d) â  (0,0) implies d â  0. So we can set a = 0, b = 0, and find c and d such that 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let's check if such c and d exist in rationals.

Let me set a = 0 and b = 0. Then 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let's divide both sides by 15: 2cÂ² + 3dÂ² = 2/45. Then 2cÂ² + 3dÂ² = 2/45. Let me try to find rational solutions here. Let's set d = 1/k. Then 3*(1/kÂ²) = 3/kÂ². So 2cÂ² = 2/45 - 3/kÂ². So cÂ² = (2/45 - 3/kÂ²)/2. For c to be rational, the right-hand side must be a square of a rational.

Let me try k = 3. Then 3/kÂ² = 3/9 = 1/3. So 2cÂ² = 2/45 - 1/3 = (2 - 15)/45 = -13/45. Negative. Not possible.

k = 5. 3/kÂ² = 3/25. 2cÂ² = 2/45 - 3/25 = (10 - 27)/225 = -17/225. Negative.

k = 6. 3/kÂ² = 3/36 = 1/12. 2cÂ² = 2/45 - 1/12 = (8 - 15)/180 = -7/180. Negative.

Hmm. Maybe try k = 15. 3/kÂ² = 3/225 = 1/75. Then 2cÂ² = 2/45 - 1/75 = (10/225 - 3/225) = 7/225. So cÂ² = 7/(225*2) = 7/450. Not a square.

Alternatively, set d = 1/â3. Wait, but d needs to be rational. Let's try d = 1/5. Then 3dÂ² = 3/25. 2cÂ² = 2/45 - 3/25 = (10 - 27)/225 = -17/225. Negative.

Alternatively, set d = 2/5. Then 3dÂ² = 12/25. 2cÂ² = 2/45 - 12/25 = (10/225 - 108/225) = -98/225. Negative.

Hmm. Maybe this approach isn't working. Let's consider scaling the entire equation.

Suppose we let variables be fractions with denominator m. Letâs set a = x/m, b = y/m, c = z/m, d = w/m where x, y, z, w, m are integers, m â  0. Then substituting into the equation:

2(x/m)^2 + 3(y/m)^2 + 30(z/m)^2 + 45(w/m)^2 = 2/3.

Multiply both sides by mÂ²: 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)mÂ².

So, 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)mÂ². Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator: 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2mÂ².

Now, we have 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2mÂ². All variables integers. So 2 divides the left-hand side. Let's see:

Left-hand side: 6xÂ² is divisible by 2, 9yÂ² is divisible by 9, 90zÂ² is divisible by 90, 135wÂ² is divisible by 135. Wait, 6xÂ² = 2*3xÂ², so divisible by 2. 9yÂ² = 9yÂ², which is divisible by 9. 90zÂ² = 90zÂ², divisible by 90. 135wÂ² = 135wÂ², divisible by 135. So the entire left-hand side is divisible by 2. Therefore, 2 divides 2mÂ², which is always true. So that's okay.

But the equation is 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2mÂ². Let's see if we can find integers x, y, z, w, m such that this holds with (y, w) â  (0,0).

Alternatively, maybe set z = 0 and w = 0, then 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 2mÂ². Let's see if this equation has solutions with y â  0.

Let me set y = 1. Then 6xÂ² + 9 = 2mÂ² â 6xÂ² = 2mÂ² - 9 â 3xÂ² = mÂ² - 9/2. But right-hand side must be integer. 9/2 is 4.5, so mÂ² must be a half-integer, which is impossible since m is integer. So y can't be 1. Similarly, y = 2: 6xÂ² + 36 = 2mÂ² â 3xÂ² + 18 = mÂ². Then mÂ² must be 18 mod 3, which is 0 mod 3. So m must be divisible by 3. Let m = 3k. Then (3k)^2 = 9kÂ² = 3xÂ² + 18 â 3kÂ² = xÂ² + 6 â xÂ² = 3kÂ² - 6. So xÂ² must be divisible by 3, so x must be divisible by 3. Let x = 3j. Then (3j)^2 = 9jÂ² = 3kÂ² - 6 â 3jÂ² = kÂ² - 2 â kÂ² = 3jÂ² + 2. So kÂ² â¡ 2 mod 3. But squares mod 3 are 0 or 1. 2 mod 3 is not a square. So no solution here either.

Hmm. Maybe y = 3. Then 9xÂ² + 81 = 2mÂ² â 9xÂ² = 2mÂ² - 81. So 2mÂ² â¡ 81 mod 9 â 2mÂ² â¡ 0 mod 9 â mÂ² â¡ 0 mod 9 â m divisible by 3. Let m = 3k. Then 2*(9kÂ²) = 18kÂ² = 9xÂ² + 81 â 2kÂ² = xÂ² + 9 â xÂ² = 2kÂ² - 9. So xÂ² must be even minus 9. 2kÂ² is even, so xÂ² is odd. So x must be odd. Let x = 2j + 1. Then (2j + 1)^2 = 4jÂ² + 4j + 1 = 2kÂ² - 9 â 4jÂ² + 4j + 1 + 9 = 2kÂ² â 4jÂ² + 4j + 10 = 2kÂ² â 2jÂ² + 2j + 5 = kÂ². So kÂ² = 2jÂ² + 2j + 5. Let me check small j:

j = 0: kÂ² = 0 + 0 + 5 = 5, not square.

j = 1: 2 + 2 + 5 = 9 â kÂ² = 9 â k = Â±3. So j=1 gives k=3. Then x = 2*1 +1 = 3. So x=3, m=3k=9. Then check: 6xÂ² +9yÂ² =6*9 +9*9=54+81=135. 2mÂ²=2*81=162. 135 â  162. Wait, that's a problem. Wait, earlier steps:

Wait, if j=1, then kÂ²=9 â k=3. Then m=3k=9. Then x=3. Then 6xÂ² +9yÂ²=6*9 +9*9=54+81=135. 2mÂ²=2*81=162. 135 â  162. So something's wrong here. Wait, maybe miscalculation.

Wait, original equation after substitution: 6xÂ² +9yÂ² =2mÂ². If y=3, x=3, then 6*9 +9*9=54+81=135. 2mÂ²=2*81=162. 135â 162. So that's not a solution. Hmm. So where did I go wrong?

Wait, when I set y=3, then 6xÂ² +9*(3)^2 =2mÂ² â6xÂ² +81=2mÂ² â6xÂ²=2mÂ² -81 â3xÂ²=mÂ² -81/2. Wait, but earlier, I set m=3k, which led to 2kÂ²= xÂ² +9. But when j=1, k=3, then x=2*1 +1=3. So x=3, k=3. Then m=9. Then 3xÂ²=3*9=27. mÂ² -81/2=81 -81/2=81/2=40.5. But 27 â  40.5. So inconsistency here. Probably made a mistake in substitution.

Wait, maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try another approach. Maybe consider the equation modulo some number to see if solutions are possible.

Looking at the equation 6xÂ² +9yÂ² +90zÂ² +135wÂ² =2mÂ². Let's consider modulo 3.

Left-hand side: 6xÂ² â¡0 mod3, 9yÂ²â¡0 mod3, 90zÂ²â¡0 mod3, 135wÂ²â¡0 mod3. So left-hand side â¡0 mod3. Right-hand side: 2mÂ². So 2mÂ² â¡0 mod3 â mÂ² â¡0 mod3 â m divisible by3. Let m=3k. Then equation becomes 6xÂ² +9yÂ² +90zÂ² +135wÂ²=2*(9kÂ²)=18kÂ². Divide both sides by 3: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6kÂ².

Again, modulo 3: 2xÂ² +0 +0 +0 â¡6kÂ² mod3 â2xÂ² â¡0 mod3 âxÂ²â¡0 mod3 âx divisible by3. Let x=3j. Then equation becomes 2*(9jÂ²) +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6kÂ² â18jÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6kÂ². Divide by 3:6jÂ² + yÂ² +10zÂ² +15wÂ²=2kÂ².

Again, modulo3: 6jÂ² â¡0 mod3, yÂ² â¡yÂ² mod3, 10zÂ²â¡1zÂ² mod3, 15wÂ²â¡0 mod3. So total: yÂ² + zÂ² â¡2kÂ² mod3.

Possible squares mod3 are 0,1. So left-hand side can be 0+0=0,0+1=1,1+0=1,1+1=2. Right-hand side: 2kÂ². If kÂ²â¡0 mod3: 2*0=0. If kÂ²â¡1 mod3: 2*1=2. So possible congruences:

Case1: kÂ²â¡0 mod3 â2kÂ²â¡0. So left-hand side must be 0: yÂ² + zÂ² â¡0 mod3. So y and z must both be 0 mod3.

Case2: kÂ²â¡1 mod3 â2kÂ²â¡2. So left-hand side must be 2: yÂ² + zÂ² â¡2 mod3. Which requires yÂ²â¡1 mod3 and zÂ²â¡1 mod3.

So let's explore case1: k divisible by3. Let k=3l. Then equation becomes6jÂ² + yÂ² +10zÂ² +15wÂ²=2*(9lÂ²)=18lÂ². Divide by 3:2jÂ² + (yÂ²)/3 + (10zÂ²)/3 +5wÂ²=6lÂ². But y and z must be divisible by3, so let y=3m, z=3n. Then equation becomes2jÂ² + (9mÂ²)/3 + (10*9nÂ²)/3 +5wÂ²=6lÂ² â2jÂ² +3mÂ² +30nÂ² +5wÂ²=6lÂ². Multiply by1:2jÂ² +3mÂ² +30nÂ² +5wÂ²=6lÂ². Hmm, not sure if helpful.

Alternatively, maybe this infinite descent approach is leading me in circles. Let's try another method.

Perhaps consider the original equation as a quadratic form and check if it's isotropic over Q (i.e., has non-trivial solutions). For quadratic forms over Q, the Hasse-Minkowski theorem says that a quadratic form has a non-trivial solution over Q if and only if it has solutions over all Q_p (for primes p) and over R.

So maybe check for solutions over real numbers and over p-adic fields. If it has solutions everywhere, then by Hasse-Minkowski, it has a solution over Q. Since we need only one non-trivial solution, we can check.

First, over real numbers: The equation 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ² =2/3. All terms are non-negative, so there are real solutions. For example, set a=1/â3, b=0, c=0, d=0. Then 2*(1/3) =2/3. So there are real solutions. So the equation is isotropic over R.

Now check p-adic solutions for primes p. For primes not dividing the coefficients, we can use Hensel's lemma. Let's check for primes 2, 3, 5, etc.

First, prime 2. The equation is 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ² =2/3. Let's homogenize the equation by introducing a variable e: 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ² -2eÂ²=0. Then check for solutions in Z_2.

But maybe better to scale variables. Let's multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ² =2eÂ². Now, check modulo 2. Coefficients:

6 â¡0 mod2, 9â¡1 mod2, 90â¡0 mod2, 135â¡1 mod2. So equation becomes 0aÂ² +1bÂ² +0cÂ² +1dÂ² â¡0 mod2 âbÂ² +dÂ² â¡0 mod2. So b and d must both be even or both be odd.

If both even: b=2b', d=2d'. Then equation becomes 6aÂ² +9*(4b'Â²) +90cÂ² +135*(4d'Â²) =2eÂ² â6aÂ² +36b'Â² +90cÂ² +540d'Â²=2eÂ² â3aÂ² +18b'Â² +45cÂ² +270d'Â² =eÂ².

But then e must be divisible by 3. Let e=3e'. Then equation becomes3aÂ² +18b'Â² +45cÂ² +270d'Â²=9e'Â² âaÂ² +6b'Â² +15cÂ² +90d'Â²=3e'Â². Again, modulo3:

aÂ² +0 +0 +0 â¡0 mod3 âaÂ² â¡0 mod3 âa divisible by3. Let a=3a'. Then equation becomes9a'Â² +6b'Â² +15cÂ² +90d'Â²=3e'Â² â3a'Â² +2b'Â² +5cÂ² +30d'Â²=e'Â².

Now, modulo2: 3a'Â² +2b'Â² +5cÂ² +30d'Â² â¡a'Â² +0 +cÂ² +0 â¡a'Â² +cÂ² â¡e'Â² mod2. So e'Â² â¡a'Â² +cÂ² mod2. Which is possible for various combinations. Not a contradiction. Maybe solutions exist here.

Alternatively, perhaps proceed with Hensel's lemma. For example, check if there is a solution modulo2^k for some k. But this might get complicated. Similarly for other primes.

Alternatively, check for prime 3. The original equation 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ² =2/3. Multiply by3:6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=2. Modulo3:6aÂ²â¡0,9bÂ²â¡0,90cÂ²â¡0,135dÂ²â¡0 mod3. So 0â¡2 mod3. Which is impossible. Wait, but this contradicts the real solutions. Wait, but the equation over Q is 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2/3. So modulo3: 2aÂ² +0 +0 +0 â¡2/3 mod3. But 2/3 is not an integer. Hmm, maybe the homogenized equation is better.

Wait, the original equation is in Q, so when checking modulo3, we have to be careful. Let's consider the equation 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ² =2/3. Multiply both sides by3:6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=2. Then modulo3:0 +0 +0 +0=2 mod3. Which is 0â¡2 mod3. Contradiction. So there are no solutions modulo3. But the equation has real solutions, so by Hasse-Minkowski, there should be solutions in the p-adic fields except for the primes where the form is isotropic. Wait, but modulo3, the equation is 0â¡2 mod3, which is impossible. Therefore, the equation is not isotropic over Q_3, hence by Hasse-Minkowski, it has no solutions over Q. Therefore, there are no rational solutions.

But wait, this contradicts the real solutions. Wait, no, the Hasse-Minkowski theorem applies to quadratic forms. The equation is a quadratic form in variables a, b, c, d. If it has solutions over all Q_p and over R, then it has a solution over Q. But here, modulo3, the equation is 0â¡2 mod3, which is impossible, so there are no solutions modulo3. Therefore, the equation is not isotropic over Q_3, hence no solutions over Q. Therefore, there are no rational solutions (a, b, c, d) except the trivial one. But the problem states (b, d)â (0,0). So even if there was a solution with (b,d)=(0,0), but since there are no solutions, then the answer is no.

Wait, but the original equation has real solutions, but no solutions over Q_3, so no solutions over Q. Therefore, the answer is no, there does not exist such a 4-tuple.

But let me double-check. The key step is that modulo3, the equation 6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ² â¡2 mod3 is impossible. So indeed, there are no solutions modulo3. Therefore, by Hasse-Minkowski, no solutions over Q. Therefore, the answer is no.

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if there exists a set of four rational numbers (a, b, c, d) where not both b and d are zero, such that 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² equals 2/3. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the equation given is a quadratic form. Quadratic forms over the rational numbers are interesting because they can have solutions depending on the coefficients and the number of variables. The question is whether this particular form can take the value 2/3 when evaluated at some non-trivial rational point (a, b, c, d) where (b, d) â  (0, 0). 

Let me note that the equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Maybe I can scale the variables to make the equation simpler. Since we're dealing with rational numbers, scaling might help. Let's suppose that a, b, c, d are rational numbers. Let's denote them as fractions: a = p/m, b = q/m, c = r/m, d = s/m, where p, q, r, s, m are integers and m â  0. Then substituting into the equation:

2*(p/m)Â² + 3*(q/m)Â² + 30*(r/m)Â² + 45*(s/m)Â² = 2/3

Multiply both sides by mÂ²:

2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = (2/3)mÂ²

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator:

6pÂ² + 9qÂ² + 90rÂ² + 135sÂ² = 2mÂ²

So now the equation is 6pÂ² + 9qÂ² + 90rÂ² + 135sÂ² = 2mÂ², where p, q, r, s, m are integers, and m â  0. Also, since (b, d) â  (0, 0), which in terms of the scaled variables becomes (q, s) â  (0, 0).

So we need integer solutions (p, q, r, s, m) with m â  0 and (q, s) â  (0, 0) such that 6pÂ² + 9qÂ² + 90rÂ² + 135sÂ² = 2mÂ².

Alternatively, we can write this as 3*(2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ²) = 2mÂ². So 3 divides the left-hand side, so 3 divides 2mÂ². Therefore, 3 divides mÂ², which implies 3 divides m. Let m = 3k for some integer k. Then substituting back:

3*(2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ²) = 2*(3k)Â² = 2*9kÂ² = 18kÂ²

Divide both sides by 3:

2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6kÂ²

So now the equation simplifies to 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = 6kÂ². Hmm, so maybe this is a better form. Let's see if we can find integers p, q, r, s, k such that this holds, with (q, s) â  (0, 0).

Alternatively, perhaps scaling variables again. Let me think. Let's set variables x = p, y = q, z = r, w = s, and t = k. Then the equation is 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6tÂ². We need integer solutions (x, y, z, w, t) with t â  0 and (y, w) â  (0, 0).

Alternatively, maybe we can factor out common terms. Let's see:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6tÂ²

Divide both sides by 3:

(2/3)xÂ² + yÂ² + 10zÂ² + 15wÂ² = 2tÂ²

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe look for solutions where some variables are zero. For example, set c = 0 and d = 0. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. But we need (b, d) â  (0, 0), so d can be zero as long as b isn't. Let's check if 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3 has solutions with b â  0. Let's set b = 1 (since we can scale), then 2aÂ² + 3 = 2/3 => 2aÂ² = -7/3, which is impossible. So that's not possible. Similarly, if we set c = 0, d â  0. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let's set d = 1, then 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 45 = 2/3 => 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = -43/3, which is also impossible. So negative values are not possible here because squares are non-negative. Wait, but all terms are squares multiplied by positive coefficients, so the left-hand side is always non-negative. Therefore, 2/3 must be positive, which it is, so that's okay. But if we set some variables to 1, we get negative values on the right, which is impossible. So maybe setting variables to 1 isn't the way.

Alternatively, perhaps set some variables to fractions. Let's think about scaling. Suppose we set a, b, c, d as fractions. Let me suppose that a = 1/m, b = 1/m, c = 1/m, d = 1/m, but this might not work. Alternatively, perhaps use some substitution.

Alternatively, maybe use the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, which states that a quadratic form over Q has a non-trivial solution if and only if it has solutions over all completions of Q, i.e., over R and over Q_p for all primes p. So perhaps check whether the equation has solutions over R and over Q_p for all primes p.

First, check over the real numbers. The equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Since all coefficients are positive, the left-hand side is non-negative, and the right-hand side is positive, so there are real solutions. For example, set a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, then 45dÂ² = 2/3 => dÂ² = 2/(135) => d = Â±â(2/135). But d must be rational. Wait, but over the reals, there are solutions, but we need rational solutions. The Hasse-Minkowski theorem says that if a quadratic form has a non-trivial solution over R and over all Q_p, then it has a non-trivial solution over Q. So we need to check the local solubility at all primes p.

But maybe this approach is complicated. Alternatively, perhaps look for solutions with small denominators. Let's suppose that a, b, c, d are rational numbers with denominators dividing some integer m. Let m be a positive integer. Let a = p/m, b = q/m, c = r/m, d = s/m, where p, q, r, s are integers. Then the equation becomes 2(p/m)Â² + 3(q/m)Â² + 30(r/m)Â² + 45(s/m)Â² = 2/3. Multiply both sides by mÂ²:

2pÂ² + 3qÂ² + 30rÂ² + 45sÂ² = (2/3)mÂ²

Multiply both sides by 3:

6pÂ² + 9qÂ² + 90rÂ² + 135sÂ² = 2mÂ²

So now we have 6pÂ² + 9qÂ² + 90rÂ² + 135sÂ² = 2mÂ², which is an equation in integers. So we need integer solutions (p, q, r, s, m) with m â  0 and (q, s) â  (0, 0).

Let me try to find some solutions. Let's try m = 1 first. Then 6pÂ² + 9qÂ² + 90rÂ² + 135sÂ² = 2. But all terms on the left are non-negative and multiples of 6, 9, 90, 135. 6pÂ² must be 0 mod 6, 9qÂ² must be 0 mod 9, 90rÂ² mod 90, 135sÂ² mod 135. The right-hand side is 2, which is not divisible by 6, 9, 90, or 135. So m = 1 is impossible.

Similarly, m = 2. Then RHS is 2*(2)^2 = 8. So 6pÂ² + 9qÂ² + 90rÂ² + 135sÂ² = 8. Let's see if this is possible. Each term on left must be a positive multiple of 6, 9, 90, 135. Let's check if 8 can be expressed as sum of such terms. 6pÂ² can be 0, 6, 12, etc. 9qÂ² can be 0, 9, 18, etc. 90rÂ² and 135sÂ² are multiples of 90 and 135, which are larger than 8. So 90rÂ² and 135sÂ² must be zero. So r = s = 0. Then equation becomes 6pÂ² + 9qÂ² = 8. 6pÂ² must be â¤ 8, so pÂ² â¤ 8/6 â 1.333. So p = 0 or 1. If p = 0, then 9qÂ² = 8 => qÂ² = 8/9, which is not an integer. If p = 1, then 6 + 9qÂ² = 8 => 9qÂ² = 2 => qÂ² = 2/9, not integer. So m = 2 is impossible.

Similarly, m = 3. RHS is 2*9 = 18. So equation: 6pÂ² + 9qÂ² + 90rÂ² + 135sÂ² = 18. Again, 90rÂ² and 135sÂ² must be multiples of 90 and 135. The maximum possible value for 90rÂ² is 18, so rÂ² = 0. Similarly, 135sÂ² â¤ 18 => s = 0. So equation reduces to 6pÂ² + 9qÂ² = 18. Divide by 3: 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² = 6. Possible solutions: Letâs check small integers. p = 0: 3qÂ² =6 => qÂ²=2, nope. p=1: 2 + 3qÂ² =6 => 3qÂ²=4 => qÂ²=4/3, nope. p=2: 8 + 3qÂ²=6 => 3qÂ²=-2, impossible. So no solutions here.

m = 6. Let's try m = 6. RHS is 2*36 = 72. Equation: 6pÂ² + 9qÂ² + 90rÂ² + 135sÂ² =72. Let's see. 90rÂ² and 135sÂ² must be multiples of 90 and 135. Let's see if possible to have non-zero r or s. Suppose r =1: 90*1=90, which is already more than 72. So r must be 0. Similarly, s must be 0. Then equation reduces to 6pÂ² + 9qÂ² =72. Divide by 3: 2pÂ² + 3qÂ² =24. Let's check possible p and q. pÂ² can be 0,1,4,9,16, etc. 2pÂ² must be even. 3qÂ² must be 0,3,12,27, etc. 2pÂ² +3qÂ² =24. Let's try pÂ²=9 (p=3): 2*9=18. Then 3qÂ²=6 => qÂ²=2, nope. pÂ²=4 (p=2): 2*4=8. Then 3qÂ²=16 => qÂ²=16/3, nope. pÂ²=16 (p=4): 2*16=32. 3qÂ²= -8, impossible. p=0: 3qÂ²=24 => qÂ²=8, nope. p=1: 2 +3qÂ²=24 =>3qÂ²=22 => qÂ²=22/3, nope. p=5: 2*25=50. 3qÂ²= -26, nope. So no solutions here.

m = 9. Let's try m=9. RHS=2*81=162. Equation:6pÂ² +9qÂ² +90rÂ² +135sÂ²=162. Let's see. 90rÂ² and 135sÂ² must be multiples of 90 and 135. Let's try r=1: 90*1=90. Then 6pÂ² +9qÂ² +135sÂ²=72. Let's set s=0: 6pÂ² +9qÂ²=72. Divide by 3: 2pÂ² +3qÂ²=24. Same as before, which had no solutions. If s=1: 135*1=135. Then 6pÂ² +9qÂ²=27. Divide by 3: 2pÂ² +3qÂ²=9. Let's check p=0: 3qÂ²=9 => qÂ²=3. No. p=1: 2 +3qÂ²=9 =>3qÂ²=7. No. p=2: 8 +3qÂ²=9 =>3qÂ²=1. No. p=3: 18 +... No. p= -1 same. So no solutions here. If r=2: 90*4=360, which exceeds 162. So r=0. Similarly, s=0. Then equation reduces to 6pÂ² +9qÂ²=162. Divide by 3: 2pÂ² +3qÂ²=54. Let's check p=3: 18 +3qÂ²=54 =>3qÂ²=36 =>qÂ²=12, nope. p=4: 32 +3qÂ²=54 =>3qÂ²=22, nope. p=5: 50 +3qÂ²=54 =>3qÂ²=4, nope. p=6: 72 +... Over. p=0: 3qÂ²=54 =>qÂ²=18, nope. p=1: 2 +3qÂ²=54 =>3qÂ²=52, nope. p=2: 8 +3qÂ²=54 =>3qÂ²=46, nope. So no solutions here.

Hmm, maybe m=12. Let's try m=12. RHS=2*144=288. Equation:6pÂ² +9qÂ² +90rÂ² +135sÂ²=288. Let's see. Let's try r=1:90. Then 6pÂ² +9qÂ² +135sÂ²=198. Let's set s=1:135. Then 6pÂ² +9qÂ²=63. Divide by 3:2pÂ² +3qÂ²=21. Let's check p=3: 18 +3qÂ²=21 =>3qÂ²=3 =>qÂ²=1. So q=Â±1. So p=3, q=1, s=1, r=1, m=12. Then check if this works. So p=3, q=1, r=1, s=1, m=12. Then a = p/m = 3/12 = 1/4, b =1/12, c=1/12, d=1/12. Let's check the original equation:

2*(1/4)^2 +3*(1/12)^2 +30*(1/12)^2 +45*(1/12)^2

Calculate each term:

2*(1/16) = 2/16 = 1/8

3*(1/144) = 3/144 = 1/48

30*(1/144) = 30/144 = 5/24

45*(1/144) = 45/144 = 5/16

Now sum them up:

1/8 + 1/48 +5/24 +5/16

Convert to 48 denominator:

(6/48) + (1/48) + (10/48) + (15/48) = (6+1+10+15)/48 = 32/48 = 2/3

Yes! So that works. So (a, b, c, d) = (1/4, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12) is a solution. But we need to check if (b, d) â  (0, 0). Here, b=1/12 and d=1/12, so yes, they are not both zero. Therefore, this is a valid solution.

Wait, but let me verify the calculation again. Let's compute each term:

2*(1/4)^2 = 2*(1/16) = 1/8 = 0.125

3*(1/12)^2 = 3*(1/144) = 1/48 â 0.0208333

30*(1/12)^2 = 30*(1/144) = 5/24 â 0.208333

45*(1/12)^2 = 45*(1/144) = 5/16 â 0.3125

Adding up: 0.125 + 0.0208333 â 0.1458333; +0.208333 â 0.3541666; +0.3125 â 0.6666666, which is 2/3. Yes, correct.

So this is a valid solution. Therefore, such a 4-tuple exists.

But wait, how did I get here? I tried m=12, found that with r=1, s=1, p=3, q=1. So that gives a solution. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But let me check again. The variables a, b, c, d are all rational numbers. Here, a = 3/12 = 1/4, b =1/12, c=1/12, d=1/12. So all are rational, and (b, d) = (1/12, 1/12) â  (0, 0). Therefore, it satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, the answer is yes, such a 4-tuple exists.

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

","Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, the question is whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) such that (b, d) is not both zero, and the sum 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² equals 2/3. Hmm, interesting. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. We have four variables a, b, c, d, all rational numbers. The condition is that at least one of b or d is non-zero. Then, their squares multiplied by some coefficients and summed up should equal 2/3. So, I need to determine if such numbers exist.

Let me write down the equation again:

2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3.

And (b, d) â  (0, 0).

Since all variables are rational, maybe I can approach this by scaling. Rational numbers can be expressed as fractions, so perhaps substituting variables with fractions would help. Alternatively, maybe I can use some number theory here. But first, let's see if I can find any solutions.

One idea is to look for small rational numbers that satisfy the equation. Let me try some simple values. For example, if I set c and d to zero, then the equation reduces to 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. Then, (b, d) would be (b, 0), so b cannot be zero. Let me see if there's a solution here.

Suppose b = 1. Then, 3(1)Â² = 3, so 2aÂ² = (2/3 - 3) = (2/3 - 9/3) = -7/3. That's negative, so no solution. If b = 1/3, then 3*(1/3)Â² = 3*(1/9) = 1/3. Then, 2aÂ² = 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3, so aÂ² = 1/6. Then a = Â±1/â6, which is irrational. So not a rational solution.

Alternatively, maybe set a = 0. Then the equation becomes 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let's see if we can have a non-zero (b, d). Let's try b = 1 again. Then 3*1 + 30cÂ² +45dÂ² = 2/3. So 30cÂ² +45dÂ² = 2/3 - 3 = -7/3. Again, negative. Not possible. If b = 1/3, then 3*(1/3)Â² = 3*(1/9) = 1/3. So 30cÂ² +45dÂ² = 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3. Then 30cÂ² +45dÂ² = 1/3. Divide both sides by 15: 2cÂ² + 3dÂ² = 1/45. Hmm, maybe set d = 1/3. Then 3*(1/3)^2 = 3*(1/9) = 1/3. So 2cÂ² = 1/45 - 1/3 = (1 - 15)/45 = -14/45. Negative again. Not possible. Maybe d = 1/5? Then 3*(1/5)^2 = 3/25. Then 2cÂ² = 1/45 - 3/25 = (5 - 27)/225 = -22/225. Still negative. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps set both b and d to be fractions. Let me try b = 1/6. Then 3*(1/6)^2 = 3/36 = 1/12. Then 30cÂ² +45dÂ² = 2/3 - 1/12 = 8/12 -1/12 =7/12. So 30cÂ² +45dÂ² =7/12. Divide by 15: 2cÂ² + 3dÂ² =7/180. Maybe set d =1/12. Then 3*(1/12)^2 =3/144=1/48. Then 2cÂ² =7/180 -1/48= (28 - 7.5)/720=20.5/720=41/1440. So cÂ²=41/2880. Again, irrational.

This trial and error might not be the best approach. Maybe I need a more systematic method. Let's think about scaling.

Suppose all variables are rational. Let me write them as fractions with some common denominator. Letâs say a = p/q, b = r/s, c = t/u, d = v/w, where p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w are integers, and q, s, u, w are positive. Then, substituting into the equation:

2*(p/q)^2 +3*(r/s)^2 +30*(t/u)^2 +45*(v/w)^2 = 2/3.

To clear denominators, multiply both sides by the least common multiple (LCM) of qÂ², sÂ², uÂ², wÂ², and 3. Letâs denote L as the LCM. Then, the equation becomes:

2pÂ²*(L/qÂ²) +3rÂ²*(L/sÂ²) +30tÂ²*(L/uÂ²) +45vÂ²*(L/wÂ²) = 2/3 * L.

But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the denominator on the right:

6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ² = 2.

So now, the equation is 6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ² =2, with (b,d) â  (0,0), and a,b,c,d â â.

Hmm, maybe scaling variables. Let me set a = x/k, b = y/k, c = z/k, d = w/k, where x,y,z,w are integers and k is a non-zero integer. Then substituting:

6*(xÂ²/kÂ²) +9*(yÂ²/kÂ²) +90*(zÂ²/kÂ²) +135*(wÂ²/kÂ²) =2.

Multiply both sides by kÂ²:

6xÂ² +9yÂ² +90zÂ² +135wÂ² =2kÂ².

So, we have 6xÂ² +9yÂ² +90zÂ² +135wÂ² =2kÂ², where x,y,z,w,k are integers, and (y,w) â  (0,0).

This is a Diophantine equation. So, the question reduces to whether there exist integers x,y,z,w,k with (y,w) not both zero, such that 6xÂ² +9yÂ² +90zÂ² +135wÂ² =2kÂ².

Now, working with integers, maybe we can look for solutions modulo some primes. Let's try modulo 3 first.

Looking at the equation modulo 3:

6xÂ² â¡0 mod3,

9yÂ² â¡0 mod3,

90zÂ² â¡0 mod3 (since 90=3*30),

135wÂ²â¡0 mod3 (135=3*45),

2kÂ² â¡2kÂ² mod3.

So, the left-hand side is 0 +0 +0 +0 =0 mod3. Therefore, the right-hand side must be 0 mod3. So 2kÂ² â¡0 mod3 â kÂ² â¡0 mod3 â k â¡0 mod3. Therefore, k must be divisible by 3. Let me write k=3m. Then the equation becomes:

6xÂ² +9yÂ² +90zÂ² +135wÂ² =2*(3m)^2=18mÂ².

Divide both sides by 3:

2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6mÂ².

Now, let's look at this equation modulo 2:

2xÂ² â¡0 mod2,

3yÂ² â¡yÂ² mod2,

30zÂ²â¡0 mod2,

45wÂ²â¡1wÂ² mod2,

6mÂ²â¡0 mod2.

So, the left-hand side is 0 + yÂ² +0 +wÂ² â¡ yÂ² +wÂ² mod2. The right-hand side is 0 mod2. Therefore, yÂ² +wÂ² â¡0 mod2. Since squares mod2 are 0 or1, this implies that y and w must both be even or both be odd. But since we are looking for solutions where (y,w) â  (0,0), but y and w can be both even or both odd.

But maybe this isn't helpful yet. Let's try to see if we can find any solutions with small integers. Let me try m=1. Then the equation is 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6.

Looking for integers x,y,z,w with 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6.

Let's see. The left-hand side is non-negative, so all terms must be non-negative. Let's check possible values for y and w, since they are multiplied by 3 and 45 respectively, which are the largest coefficients.

If y and w are non-zero, then their squares would contribute at least 3*1=3 and 45*1=45, which already exceeds 6. So, if y and w are both non-zero, the sum would be too big. Therefore, to have a chance, either y or w must be zero.

But wait, the original condition is (b,d) â  (0,0), which in terms of our variables is (y/k, w/k) â  (0,0). So, (y,w) â  (0,0). But in our equation, if y and w are both non-zero, but their squares are too large. Therefore, perhaps only one of y or w is non-zero.

Case 1: y â 0, w=0. Then the equation is 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² =6.

Case 2: w â 0, y=0. Then the equation is 2xÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6.

Let me check case 1 first: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ²=6.

Possible small integer solutions. Let's try z=0. Then 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=6. So 2xÂ²=6-3yÂ². Since 6-3yÂ² must be non-negative, 3yÂ² â¤6 â yÂ² â¤2. So y=0 or y=Â±1.

If y=0: 2xÂ²=6 âxÂ²=3 âx irrational. Not integer.

If y=Â±1: 2xÂ²=6 -3=3 âxÂ²=3/2. Not integer. So no solution here with z=0.

If z=1: 30*1=30. 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=6 -30= -24. Negative. Not possible.

Similarly, z=-1: same. So no solutions in case 1.

Case 2: 2xÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6.

Again, z and w are integers. Let's try w=0. Then 2xÂ² +30zÂ²=6. So 2xÂ²=6 -30zÂ². 30zÂ² â¤6 â zÂ² â¤6/30=1/5. So z=0.

If z=0: 2xÂ²=6 âxÂ²=3. Not integer.

w=Â±1: 45*1=45. 2xÂ² +30zÂ²=6 -45= -39. Negative. Not possible.

Similarly, higher w would make it more negative. So no solutions in case 2.

Therefore, there are no solutions with m=1. Maybe try m=2. Then, 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6*(2)^2=24.

Looking for integer solutions here. Again, let's check if y and w can be non-zero.

If both y and w are non-zero, then 3yÂ² +45wÂ² â¥3*1 +45*1=48, which is more than 24. So again, only one of y or w can be non-zero.

Case 1: y â 0, w=0. Then 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ²=24.

Case 2: w â 0, y=0. Then 2xÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=24.

Case 1: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ²=24.

Possible z values. Let's try z=0: 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=24.

Possible yÂ²: 24 -2xÂ² must be divisible by 3. So 2xÂ² â¡24 mod3 â2xÂ²â¡0 mod3 âxÂ²â¡0 mod3 âxâ¡0 mod3. Let x=3a. Then 2*(9aÂ²) +3yÂ²=24 â18aÂ² +3yÂ²=24 â6aÂ² +yÂ²=8.

So yÂ²=8 -6aÂ². Possible a=0: yÂ²=8. Not integer. a=1: yÂ²=8-6=2. Not integer. a=-1: same. a=2: yÂ²=8 -24= -16. Negative. So no solutions here.

z=1: 30*1=30. 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=24 -30= -6. Negative. Not possible.

z=-1: same. So no solutions in case 1.

Case 2: 2xÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=24.

Again, try w=0: 2xÂ² +30zÂ²=24. Similar to above. Let me check z=0: 2xÂ²=24 âxÂ²=12. Not integer. z=1: 30*1=30. 2xÂ²=24-30=-6. Negative. So no solutions.

w=1: 45*1=45. 2xÂ² +30zÂ²=24 -45= -21. Negative. Similarly, higher w would make it worse.

So no solutions for m=2. Hmm. Maybe try m=3. Then equation is 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6*(3)^2=54.

Again, check if y and w can be non-zero. If both non-zero, 3yÂ² +45wÂ² â¥3+45=48. So 2xÂ² +30zÂ² â¤54 -48=6. So 2xÂ² +30zÂ² â¤6. Then 30zÂ² â¤6 â z=0. Then 2xÂ² â¤6 âxÂ² â¤3. So x=0, Â±1.

If x=0: 3yÂ² +45wÂ²=54. Divide by 3: yÂ² +15wÂ²=18.

Possible solutions: y and w integers. Let's try w=1: yÂ²=18 -15=3. Not square. w=0: yÂ²=18. Not square. w=2: 15*4=60. 18-60= -42. So no. Similarly, no solutions here.

If x=Â±1: 2*1 +3yÂ² +30zÂ²=54 â3yÂ² +30zÂ²=52. Divide by 3: yÂ² +10zÂ²â17.333. Not integer. So no.

If x=Â±2: 2*4=8. 3yÂ² +30zÂ²=54 -8=46. Divide by 3: yÂ² +10zÂ²â15.333. Not integer. Similarly, no.

Thus, no solutions here either. Hmm. Maybe m=4? Let's see, but this might take too long. Maybe there's a pattern here.

Alternatively, perhaps scaling up the equation. Let me think. If we can find a solution with some scaling factor, then we can divide by that factor. Wait, but all variables are rational. Maybe scaling by a common denominator.

Alternatively, consider the original equation: 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2/3. Multiply both sides by 3 to get 6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=2. Let me consider variables scaled by a factor. Suppose we set a = (1/3)e, b = (1/3)f, c = (1/3)g, d = (1/3)h. Then the equation becomes:

6*(1/3)^2 eÂ² +9*(1/3)^2 fÂ² +90*(1/3)^2 gÂ² +135*(1/3)^2 hÂ² =2.

Compute each term:

6*(1/9)eÂ² = (2/3)eÂ²,

9*(1/9)fÂ² = fÂ²,

90*(1/9)gÂ² =10gÂ²,

135*(1/9)hÂ²=15hÂ².

Thus, the equation becomes:

(2/3)eÂ² + fÂ² +10gÂ² +15hÂ² =2.

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe another scaling. Let me try to set e = f = g = h =1. Then (2/3)(1) +1 +10 +15=2/3 +1+10+15=26 +2/3=26.666..., which is much larger than 2. Not helpful.

Alternatively, set e=1, f=1, g=1, h=1. Then (2/3)eÂ² +fÂ² +10gÂ² +15hÂ²= (2/3) +1 +10 +15=26.666... Still too big. Maybe set some variables to zero. For example, set g=0, h=0. Then the equation is (2/3)eÂ² +fÂ²=2. Looking for rational solutions. Let's set f=1. Then (2/3)eÂ²=2 -1=1 âeÂ²=3/2 âe irrational. f=1/2: (2/3)eÂ²=2 -1/4=7/4 âeÂ²=(7/4)*(3/2)=21/8 âe irrational. f=2/3: (2/3)eÂ²=2 -4/9=14/9 âeÂ²=(14/9)*(3/2)=7/3 âe irrational. Hmm. Not helpful.

Alternatively, set e=1. Then (2/3)(1) +fÂ² +10gÂ² +15hÂ²=2 âfÂ² +10gÂ² +15hÂ²=4/3. Then fÂ²=4/3 -10gÂ² -15hÂ². Since fÂ² must be non-negative, 4/3 -10gÂ² -15hÂ² â¥0 â10gÂ² +15hÂ² â¤4/3. But g and h are rational. Let's try g=0, h=0: fÂ²=4/3. Then f=Â±2/â3, which is irrational. g=1/3: 10*(1/3)^2=10/9. 15hÂ² â¤4/3 -10/9= (12/9 -10/9)=2/9. So hÂ² â¤2/(9*15)=2/135. So h=0 or h=Â±1/12. If h=1/12: hÂ²=1/144. Then fÂ²=4/3 -10/9 -15/144= (192/144 -160/144 -15/144)=17/144. So f=Â±â(17)/12. Still irrational. Not helpful.

This approach isn't working. Maybe I need another strategy. Let me think about the quadratic form. The equation is 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2/3. Maybe diagonalize the quadratic form or see if it's isotropic over â.

Alternatively, consider the equation as a quadratic in one variable and try to solve for that variable. For example, solve for aÂ²: aÂ²=(2/3 -3bÂ² -30cÂ² -45dÂ²)/2. Since a must be rational, the right-hand side must be a non-negative rational number. Let me set some variables to zero to simplify.

Suppose we set c=0 and d=0. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² +3bÂ²=2/3. As before, this requires aÂ²=(2/3 -3bÂ²)/2. Letâs set b=1/3. Then aÂ²=(2/3 -3*(1/9))/2=(2/3 -1/3)/2=(1/3)/2=1/6. So a=Â±1/â6, which is irrational. Not helpful.

Alternatively, set b=1/â3. Then 3bÂ²=1. So aÂ²=(2/3 -1)/2=(-1/3)/2=-1/6. Negative. Not possible.

Alternatively, set b=1/6. Then 3bÂ²=3*(1/36)=1/12. Then aÂ²=(2/3 -1/12)/2=(8/12 -1/12)/2=(7/12)/2=7/24. Again, irrational.

Alternatively, set a=1/3. Then 2*(1/9)=2/9. So 3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2/3 -2/9=4/9. So 3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=4/9. Divide by 3: bÂ² +10cÂ² +15dÂ²=4/27. Maybe set c=0, d=0: bÂ²=4/27 âb=Â±2/(3â3). Irrational. c=1/3: 10*(1/9)=10/9. Then bÂ² +15dÂ²=4/27 -10/9= (4/27 -30/27)= -26/27. Negative. Not possible.

This seems challenging. Maybe I need a different approach. Let's consider scaling the entire equation. Suppose we multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:

6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=2.

Now, let me try to find a solution where all variables are rational. Let's set a=1/3, b=1/3, c=1/3, d=1/3. Then:

6*(1/9) +9*(1/9) +90*(1/9) +135*(1/9)= (6 +9 +90 +135)/9=240/9=80/3â26.666... Not 2. Too big.

Alternatively, set a=1/6, b=1/6, c=1/6, d=1/6. Then:

6*(1/36) +9*(1/36) +90*(1/36) +135*(1/36)= (6 +9 +90 +135)/36=240/36=20/3â6.666... Still too big.

Alternatively, set smaller fractions. Let me try a=1/12, b=1/12, c=1/12, d=1/12. Then:

6*(1/144) +9*(1/144) +90*(1/144) +135*(1/144)= (6 +9 +90 +135)/144=240/144=5/3â1.666... Closer, but still not 2.

Alternatively, set a=1/12, b=1/12, c=1/12, d=1/12. Then sum is 240/144=5/3. To get 2, which is 6/3, we need to increase the sum by 1/3. Maybe adjust one variable. For example, set a=1/12, b=1/12, c=1/12, d=1/12 + something. But this is vague.

Alternatively, think of the equation as 6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=2. Let me factor out common terms. 6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=2 â3(2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²)=2 â2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2/3. Wait, that's the original equation. So factoring didn't help.

Alternatively, divide the entire equation by 2: 3aÂ² + (9/2)bÂ² +45cÂ² + (135/2)dÂ² =1. Still messy.

Wait, perhaps use the Hasse principle. For quadratic forms, if a form has a solution over â_p for all prime p and over â, then it has a solution over â. But I'm not sure about the conditions here.

First, check over â: The equation is 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2/3. Since all coefficients are positive, there are real solutions. For example, set a=1/â3, b=0, c=0, d=0. Then 2*(1/3)=2/3. So that's a solution. But we need (b,d)â (0,0). So another example: set b=1/â3, d=0. Then 3*(1/3)=1. Then 2aÂ² +1=2/3 â2aÂ²= -1/3. No. So that's not good.

Alternatively, set b=1/â3 and d=1/â3. Then 3*(1/3) +45*(1/3)=1 +15=16. Then 2aÂ² +16=2/3 â2aÂ²= -46/3. Negative. Not possible.

Alternatively, set a=0, b=1/â3, c=0, d=0. Then 3*(1/3)=1=2/3? No. So not a solution. Wait, the only real solution with (b,d)=(0,0) is a= Â±â(1/3). But we need (b,d)â (0,0). So maybe set b=1/â3 and d=1/â3. Then 3*(1/3) +45*(1/3)=1 +15=16. Then 2aÂ² +16=2/3 â2aÂ²= -46/3. No. So no real solution with (b,d)â (0,0). Wait, but that contradicts the Hasse principle? Wait, no, the Hasse principle is for quadratic forms in variables, but here we have a diophantine equation. Maybe not directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe consider the equation modulo 2. Let's see:

Original equation: 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2/3. Multiply by 3:6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=2.

Modulo 2:

6aÂ² â¡0 mod2,

9bÂ² â¡1bÂ² mod2,

90cÂ²â¡0 mod2,

135dÂ²â¡1dÂ² mod2,

2â¡0 mod2.

So the equation modulo2 is bÂ² +dÂ² â¡0 mod2. Which requires b and d both even or both odd. So possible. But since we need (b,d)â (0,0), but mod2, (0,0) is allowed. So not sure.

Alternatively, check modulo 3:

6aÂ²â¡0 mod3,

9bÂ²â¡0 mod3,

90cÂ²â¡0 mod3,

135dÂ²â¡0 mod3,

2â¡2 mod3.

So the equation modulo3 is 0+0+0+0â¡2 mod3 â0â¡2 mod3. Contradiction. Wait, that can't be. Did I do that correctly?

Wait, the equation is 6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=2. Modulo3:

6aÂ²â¡0 mod3,

9bÂ²â¡0 mod3,

90cÂ²â¡0 mod3,

135dÂ²â¡0 mod3,

2â¡2 mod3.

So 0â¡2 mod3. Contradiction. Therefore, there are no solutions modulo3. Therefore, by the Hasse principle, since there are no solutions modulo3, there are no rational solutions.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. If the equation has no solutions modulo3, then it cannot have a solution in â. Because any rational solution would give a solution modulo3. Therefore, since there are no solutions modulo3, there are no rational solutions. Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, let me check again. The equation is 6aÂ² +9bÂ² +90cÂ² +135dÂ²=2. Modulo3, all coefficients except the right-hand side are multiples of3. So 0â¡2 mod3. Contradiction. Therefore, no solutions. Hence, there does not exist such a 4-tuple.

Therefore, the answer is no.

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if there's a 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) where at least one of b or d isn't zero, and they satisfy the equation 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Hmm, let's start by understanding the problem.

First, the equation is a quadratic form in four variables. The coefficients are all positive, so each term is non-negative. Since we're dealing with rational numbers, maybe scaling can help? Like, if I can find a solution in integers or some scaled version, then I can divide by a common denominator to get rational numbers.

Wait, but the right-hand side is 2/3, which is less than 1. Let me check the left-hand side. If all variables were zero, it would be zero. But we need (b, d) â  (0,0), so at least one of b or d must be non-zero. Let's see, if b or d is non-zero, then their squares will contribute positively to the sum. So the sum has to equal 2/3. But since the coefficients are positive, the variables can't be too large. Maybe small fractions?

Alternatively, maybe we can think about this equation as a quadratic form and check if it's isotropic over the rationals. Isotropic means there exists a non-trivial solution (not all zeros). But here, we have a specific equation equal to 2/3. Maybe scaling the equation?

Let me consider scaling all variables by some rational number. Letâs suppose that a, b, c, d are all rational numbers. Letâs write them as fractions: a = p/q, b = r/q, c = s/q, d = t/q, where p, r, s, t, q are integers and q â  0. Then substituting into the equation:

2*(p/q)Â² + 3*(r/q)Â² + 30*(s/q)Â² + 45*(t/q)Â² = 2/3

Multiply both sides by qÂ²:

2pÂ² + 3rÂ² + 30sÂ² + 45tÂ² = (2/3)qÂ²

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

6pÂ² + 9rÂ² + 90sÂ² + 135tÂ² = 2qÂ²

Now, all variables p, r, s, t, q are integers, and we need (r, t) â  (0, 0). So the equation becomes 6pÂ² + 9rÂ² + 90sÂ² + 135tÂ² = 2qÂ². Let's see if this equation has non-trivial integer solutions.

Maybe we can find small integers p, r, s, t, q that satisfy this. Let's try some small values.

First, note that the left-hand side is even because 6pÂ², 9rÂ², 90sÂ², 135tÂ²: 6pÂ² is even, 9rÂ² is divisible by 3, 90sÂ² is 90 times sÂ², which is even if s is even, but 90 is even, so 90sÂ² is even. Similarly, 135tÂ²: 135 is odd, so 135tÂ² is odd if t is odd, even if t is even. But the right-hand side is 2qÂ², which is even. So the left-hand side must be even. Let's check:

6pÂ² is even, 9rÂ² is divisible by 3. If r is even, 9rÂ² is divisible by 36, hence divisible by 4. If r is odd, 9rÂ² is 9*(odd)Â² = 9*odd = 9 mod 4. Wait, but 9 mod 4 is 1, so 9rÂ² mod 4 is 1 if r is odd, 0 if r is even.

Similarly, 90sÂ²: 90 is even, so 90sÂ² is even. 135tÂ²: 135 is odd, so 135tÂ² mod 2 is same as tÂ² mod 2. If t is even, 135tÂ² is even; if t is odd, it's odd.

So overall, the left-hand side:

6pÂ² (even) + 9rÂ² (0 or 1 mod 4) + 90sÂ² (even) + 135tÂ² (0 or 1 mod 2) = 2qÂ² (even).

Letâs break it down mod 4:

6pÂ² mod 4: 6 mod 4 is 2, so 2*(pÂ² mod 4). Possible values: p even â pÂ² â¡ 0 mod 4 â 2*0=0; p odd â pÂ² â¡ 1 mod 4 â 2*1=2.

9rÂ² mod 4: If r even, 9rÂ² â¡ 0 mod 4; if r odd, 9rÂ² â¡ 1 mod 4.

90sÂ² mod 4: 90 â¡ 2 mod 4, so 2*(sÂ² mod 4). s even â 0; s odd â 2.

135tÂ² mod 4: 135 â¡ 3 mod 4, so 3*(tÂ² mod 4). t even â 0; t odd â 3*(1)=3 mod 4.

Adding all together:

Case 1: p even, r even, s even, t even:

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 â¡ 0 mod 4. RHS 2qÂ² â¡ 0 mod 4. So possible.

Case 2: p even, r even, s even, t odd:

0 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 3 mod 4. RHS 2qÂ² â¡ 0 mod 4. Not possible.

Case 3: p even, r even, s odd, t even:

0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 2 mod 4. RHS 0. Not possible.

Case 4: p even, r even, s odd, t odd:

0 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 5 â¡ 1 mod 4. Not possible.

Case 5: p even, r odd, s even, t even:

0 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 mod 4. RHS 0. Not possible.

Case 6: p even, r odd, s even, t odd:

0 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 4 â¡ 0 mod 4. Possible.

Case 7: p even, r odd, s odd, t even:

0 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 3 mod 4. Not possible.

Case 8: p even, r odd, s odd, t odd:

0 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 â¡ 2 mod 4. Not possible.

Case 9: p odd, r even, s even, t even:

2 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 2 mod 4. RHS 0. Not possible.

Case 10: p odd, r even, s even, t odd:

2 + 0 + 0 + 3 = 5 â¡ 1 mod 4. Not possible.

Case 11: p odd, r even, s odd, t even:

2 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 4 â¡ 0 mod 4. Possible.

Case 12: p odd, r even, s odd, t odd:

2 + 0 + 2 + 3 = 7 â¡ 3 mod 4. Not possible.

Case 13: p odd, r odd, s even, t even:

2 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3 mod 4. Not possible.

Case 14: p odd, r odd, s even, t odd:

2 + 1 + 0 + 3 = 6 â¡ 2 mod 4. Not possible.

Case 15: p odd, r odd, s odd, t even:

2 + 1 + 2 + 0 = 5 â¡ 1 mod 4. Not possible.

Case 16: p odd, r odd, s odd, t odd:

2 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 8 â¡ 0 mod 4. Possible.

So possible cases are 1,6,11,16. Let's note that.

But this seems complicated. Maybe there are solutions where all variables are even? Let's try small even numbers.

Suppose we set p, r, s, t, q to be even. Letâs let p = 2p', r = 2r', s = 2s', t = 2t', q = 2q'. Substitute into the equation:

6*(2p')Â² + 9*(2r')Â² + 90*(2s')Â² + 135*(2t')Â² = 2*(2q')Â²

Compute each term:

6*4p'Â² = 24p'Â²

9*4r'Â² = 36r'Â²

90*4s'Â² = 360s'Â²

135*4t'Â² = 540t'Â²

Right-hand side: 2*4q'Â² = 8q'Â²

So equation becomes 24p'Â² + 36r'Â² + 360s'Â² + 540t'Â² = 8q'Â²

Divide both sides by 4: 6p'Â² + 9r'Â² + 90s'Â² + 135t'Â² = 2q'Â²

Wait, this is the same as the original equation but with variables p', r', s', t', q'. So we can repeat this process: set all variables even, leading to the same equation scaled down. So unless we have a non-trivial solution where at least one variable is odd, we can keep scaling down. However, since we're dealing with integers, we can't scale indefinitely, so there must be a solution where at least one variable is odd. So perhaps in the minimal solution, at least one variable is odd. Let's check the possible cases.

Looking back at the cases where it's possible mod 4: cases 1,6,11,16.

Case 1: p even, r even, s even, t even. If all even, then we can keep scaling down, so minimal solution would have at least one odd.

Case 6: p even, r odd, s even, t odd.

Case 11: p odd, r even, s odd, t even.

Case 16: p odd, r odd, s odd, t odd.

So in the minimal solutions, at least one variable is odd. Let's look for such solutions.

Let me try small integers. Let's start with the case where p is odd, r is even, s is odd, t is even (case 11). Let's set p = 1, r = 0, s = 1, t = 0, q = ?

Plug into equation: 6*1 + 9*0 + 90*1 + 135*0 = 6 + 90 = 96 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 48 â q = sqrt(48) which is irrational. Not integer. So no solution here.

Next, try p = 1, r = 2, s = 1, t = 0. Then:

6*1 + 9*4 + 90*1 + 135*0 = 6 + 36 + 90 = 132 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 66 â not square.

p = 1, r = 2, s = 1, t = 1:

6 + 36 + 90 + 135 = 267 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 133.5, not integer.

p = 1, r = 2, s = 1, t = 2:

6 + 36 + 90 + 540 = 672 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 336 â not square.

p = 1, r = 4, s = 1, t = 2:

6 + 9*16 + 90 + 135*4 = 6 + 144 + 90 + 540 = 780 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 390, nope.

Hmm, maybe try another case. Let's try case 6: p even, r odd, s even, t odd.

Letâs set p = 0, r = 1, s = 0, t = 1:

0 + 9*1 + 0 + 135*1 = 9 + 135 = 144 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 72 â q = 6*sqrt(2), not integer.

p = 0, r = 1, s = 0, t = 3:

9 + 135*9 = 9 + 1215 = 1224 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 612, not square.

p = 0, r = 1, s = 2, t = 1:

9*1 + 90*4 + 135*1 = 9 + 360 + 135 = 504 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 252, not square.

p = 0, r = 1, s = 2, t = 3:

9 + 90*4 + 135*9 = 9 + 360 + 1215 = 1584 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 792, not square.

p = 0, r = 3, s = 0, t = 1:

9*9 + 135*1 = 81 + 135 = 216 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 108, not square.

p = 0, r = 3, s = 0, t = 3:

81 + 135*9 = 81 + 1215 = 1296 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 648, not square.

p = 2, r = 1, s = 0, t = 1:

6*4 + 9 + 0 + 135 = 24 + 9 + 135 = 168 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 84, nope.

p = 2, r = 1, s = 0, t = 3:

24 + 9 + 135*9 = 24 + 9 + 1215 = 1248 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 624, nope.

p = 2, r = 1, s = 2, t = 1:

24 + 9 + 90*4 + 135 = 24 + 9 + 360 + 135 = 528 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 264, nope.

p = 2, r = 3, s = 0, t = 1:

24 + 9*9 + 135 = 24 + 81 + 135 = 240 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 120, nope.

p = 2, r = 3, s = 0, t = 3:

24 + 81 + 135*9 = 24 + 81 + 1215 = 1320 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 660, nope.

Hmm, not working. Let me try case 16: p odd, r odd, s odd, t odd.

Set p = 1, r = 1, s = 1, t = 1:

6 + 9 + 90 + 135 = 240 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 120, not square.

p = 1, r = 1, s = 1, t = 3:

6 + 9 + 90 + 135*9 = 6 + 9 + 90 + 1215 = 1320 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 660, nope.

p = 1, r = 3, s = 1, t = 1:

6 + 9*9 + 90 + 135 = 6 + 81 + 90 + 135 = 312 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 156, nope.

p = 3, r = 1, s = 1, t = 1:

6*9 + 9 + 90 + 135 = 54 + 9 + 90 + 135 = 288 = 2qÂ² â qÂ² = 144 â q = 12. Wait, this works!

Wait, let's check:

p = 3, r = 1, s = 1, t = 1:

6*(3)^2 + 9*(1)^2 + 90*(1)^2 + 135*(1)^2 = 6*9 + 9*1 + 90*1 + 135*1 = 54 + 9 + 90 + 135 = 54 + 9 is 63, 63 + 90 is 153, 153 + 135 is 288. Then 2qÂ² = 288 â qÂ² = 144 â q = 12 or -12.

So this gives a solution: p=3, r=1, s=1, t=1, q=12. Therefore, the original variables would be:

a = p/q = 3/12 = 1/4

b = r/q = 1/12

c = s/q = 1/12

d = t/q = 1/12

Check if this satisfies the original equation:

2*(1/4)^2 + 3*(1/12)^2 + 30*(1/12)^2 + 45*(1/12)^2

Compute each term:

2*(1/16) = 2/16 = 1/8

3*(1/144) = 3/144 = 1/48

30*(1/144) = 30/144 = 5/24

45*(1/144) = 45/144 = 5/16

Now sum them up:

1/8 + 1/48 + 5/24 + 5/16

Convert to 48 denominator:

1/8 = 6/48

1/48 = 1/48

5/24 = 10/48

5/16 = 15/48

Total: 6 + 1 + 10 + 15 = 32/48 = 2/3. Yes! It works.

Therefore, there exists such a 4-tuple: (1/4, 1/12, 1/12, 1/12). And since b=1/12 and d=1/12 are not both zero, this satisfies the condition.

So the answer is yes, such a tuple exists.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if there's a 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) where neither b nor d is zero, such that 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² equals 2/3. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this equation is asking. 

First, all variables a, b, c, d are rational numbers. The condition (b, d) â  (0, 0) means that at least one of b or d is non-zero, so the equation isn't trivial. The equation itself is a sum of squares with different coefficients. Since rational numbers are involved, maybe I can find a way to scale the variables or use some substitution to simplify the equation.

Let me think. If I can find some rational numbers a, b, c, d that satisfy this equation, then the answer is yes. If not, then no. Maybe I can try to set some variables to zero or find a way to reduce the number of variables. For example, if I set c and d to zero, then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. But then (b, d) would be (b, 0), which is not allowed since d is zero. So that approach might not work. Similarly, setting a and c to zero would give 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3, but again, if d is zero, then b would have to be non-zero, but 3bÂ² = 2/3 implies bÂ² = 2/9, so b could be Â±â(2)/3, which is irrational. Wait, but we need b to be rational. So even if we set a and c to zero, the equation 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 would require b and d to be rational. Let me check if that's possible.

Suppose c = 0. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. If I set a = 0, then 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Dividing both sides by 3, we get bÂ² + 15dÂ² = 2/9. So we need rational numbers b and d such that bÂ² + 15dÂ² = 2/9. Let me see if such numbers exist. Let me try to parametrize this. Suppose d is a rational number, say d = p/q where p and q are integers with no common factors. Then dÂ² = pÂ²/qÂ², so 15dÂ² = 15pÂ²/qÂ². Then bÂ² = 2/9 - 15pÂ²/qÂ² = (2qÂ² - 135pÂ²)/81qÂ². For bÂ² to be non-negative, 2qÂ² - 135pÂ² â¥ 0. So 2qÂ² â¥ 135pÂ². That implies that qÂ² â¥ (135/2)pÂ². Since p and q are integers, this would require q to be large compared to p. Maybe p and q are both multiples of some number. Let's try small integers. Let p = 1, then 2qÂ² â¥ 135*1 => qÂ² â¥ 67.5 => q â¥ 9 (since 8Â²=64 < 67.5, 9Â²=81 â¥ 67.5). Let's try q = 9, p = 1. Then bÂ² = (2*81 - 135*1)/81*81 = (162 - 135)/6561 = 27/6561 = 1/243. Then b = Â±â(1/243) = Â±1/(9â3) = Â±â3/(27), which is irrational. Not good. Next, p = 2, q = 12 (since 135*4 = 540; 2qÂ² = 2*144 = 288 < 540, so not enough. Maybe q = 15. Then 2qÂ² = 2*225 = 450. 450 â¥ 135*4=540? No, 450 < 540. Hmm, maybe p =1, q=9 gives us b irrational, p=2, q=12 gives no solution. Maybe this approach isn't working. Let me try another way.

Alternatively, maybe set d = 1/k for some integer k, then dÂ² = 1/kÂ², so 15dÂ² = 15/kÂ². Then bÂ² = 2/9 - 15/kÂ². Let me choose k such that 15/kÂ² is less than 2/9. So 15/kÂ² < 2/9 => 135 < 2kÂ² => kÂ² > 67.5 => k â¥ 9. Let's try k =9. Then bÂ² = 2/9 - 15/81 = 2/9 - 5/27 = (6 - 5)/27 = 1/27. Then b = Â±1/(3â3) = Â±â3/9, which is irrational. k=10: 15/100 = 3/20. 2/9 - 3/20 = (40 - 27)/180 = 13/180. Then b = Â±â(13/180) = Â±â13/(6â5), which is also irrational. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, maybe set b and d such that both terms are fractions. Let me think, if I can write the equation as 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3, maybe I can find a common denominator. Let me multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators: 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. Now, all coefficients are integers, and the right-hand side is 2. So we have 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. Since a, b, c, d are rational, let me write them as fractions. Let a = x/m, b = y/m, c = z/m, d = w/m, where x, y, z, w, m are integers with m > 0 and no common factors. Then substituting into the equation:

6(x/m)Â² + 9(y/m)Â² + 90(z/m)Â² + 135(w/m)Â² = 2

Multiply both sides by mÂ²:

6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2mÂ²

So we have 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2mÂ². All variables x, y, z, w, m are integers, m > 0, and gcd(x, y, z, w, m) = 1. So we need integer solutions to this equation where not both y and w are zero.

Let me factor out common terms. Let's see:

6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2mÂ²

Divide both sides by 3:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)mÂ²

Wait, but m is an integer, so (2/3)mÂ² must be an integer. Therefore, mÂ² must be divisible by 3, which implies that m is divisible by 3. Let m = 3n, where n is an integer. Then substituting back:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)(9nÂ²) = 6nÂ²

So now we have 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6nÂ². Again, all variables are integers, and we need non-trivial solutions (since (b, d) â  (0,0) implies that (y, w) â  (0,0) in the scaled variables).

Let me try to find some integers x, y, z, w, n satisfying this equation. Maybe start by setting some variables to zero. For example, set z = w = 0. Then the equation becomes 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² = 6nÂ². Divide by gcd(2,3,6) which is 1, so 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² = 6nÂ². Let's see if this equation has integer solutions. For example, set x = n, then 2nÂ² + 3yÂ² = 6nÂ² => 3yÂ² = 4nÂ² => yÂ² = (4/3)nÂ², which is not possible unless n=0, but n=0 would lead to m=0, which is not allowed. Alternatively, set y = n, then 2xÂ² + 3nÂ² = 6nÂ² => 2xÂ² = 3nÂ² => xÂ² = (3/2)nÂ², which again requires n=0. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, set x = 3k, y = 2k. Then 2*(9kÂ²) + 3*(4kÂ²) = 18kÂ² + 12kÂ² = 30kÂ². Then 30kÂ² = 6nÂ² => 5kÂ² = nÂ². So n = Â±â5 k. But â5 is irrational, so k must be zero. Again, trivial solution. Not helpful.

Alternatively, set z and w non-zero. Let me try to find small integer solutions. Let's try n=1. Then 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = 6. Let's see. Since 2xÂ² and 3yÂ² are non-negative, and 30zÂ² and 45wÂ² are non-negative. Let's try z=0, w=0: 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² =6. Possible solutions? Let's see, 2xÂ² â¤6 => xÂ² â¤3 => x=0, Â±1. x=0: 3yÂ²=6 => yÂ²=2, which is not integer. x=1: 2 + 3yÂ²=6 => 3yÂ²=4 => yÂ²=4/3, not integer. x=-1 same as x=1. So no solutions. z=0, w=1: 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 45 =6 => 2xÂ² +3yÂ² =-39. Impossible. z=1, w=0: 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² +30=6 => 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=-24. Impossible. z=1, w=1: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30 +45=6 => 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=-69. Impossible. So n=1 has no solutions. n=2: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=24. Let's see. z=0, w=0: 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=24. Possible? 2xÂ² â¤24 => xÂ² â¤12. x=0: 3yÂ²=24 => yÂ²=8, not integer. x=Â±1: 2 +3yÂ²=24 => 3yÂ²=22 => yÂ²=22/3, nope. x=Â±2: 8 +3yÂ²=24 => 3yÂ²=16 => yÂ²=16/3, nope. x=Â±3: 18 +3yÂ²=24 => yÂ²=2, nope. x=Â±4: 32 +3yÂ²=24, which is negative. So no. z=0, w=1: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +45=24 => 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=-21. Impossible. Similarly, other z and w would lead to negative terms. z=1, w=0: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30=24 => 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=-6. Impossible. So n=2 also no solution. n=3: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=54. Let's try z=1, w=1: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30 +45=54 => 2xÂ² +3yÂ²= -21. No. z=1, w=0: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30=54 => 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=24. Wait, same as n=2 case. No solution. z=0, w=1: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +45=54 => 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=9. Let's see. 2xÂ² â¤9 => xÂ² â¤4.5 => x=0, Â±1, Â±2. x=0: 3yÂ²=9 => yÂ²=3, nope. x=Â±1: 2 +3yÂ²=9 =>3yÂ²=7 => yÂ²=7/3, nope. x=Â±2: 8 +3yÂ²=9 =>3yÂ²=1 => yÂ²=1/3, nope. So no solution. z=2, w=0: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +120=54 => 2xÂ² +3yÂ²= -66. Impossible. So n=3 also no solution.

This approach isn't working. Maybe we need to consider non-zero z and w. Let's try n=5. Wait, but n=5 would give 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=50. Maybe z=1, w=0: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30=50 =>2xÂ² +3yÂ²=20. Let's see. 2xÂ² â¤20 =>xÂ² â¤10. x=0: 3yÂ²=20 => yÂ²=20/3. x=Â±1: 2 +3yÂ²=20 =>3yÂ²=18 => yÂ²=6. x=Â±2: 8 +3yÂ²=20 =>3yÂ²=12 => yÂ²=4 => y=Â±2. Wait, so x=Â±2, y=Â±2, z=1, w=0. Then 2*(4) +3*(4) +30*(1) +45*(0) =8 +12 +30 +0=50. Yes! So that works. But wait, in our substitution, we had m=3n=15. So the original variables would be a = x/m = Â±2/15, b = y/m = Â±2/15, c = z/m =1/15, d = w/m=0. But wait, d=0 in this solution, which is not allowed. So we need a solution where w â 0. Let's try z=0, w=1. Then 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +45=50 =>2xÂ² +3yÂ²=5. Let's see. 2xÂ² â¤5 =>x=0, Â±1. x=0:3yÂ²=5 => yÂ²=5/3. x=Â±1:2 +3yÂ²=5 =>3yÂ²=3 =>yÂ²=1 =>y=Â±1. So x=Â±1, y=Â±1, z=0, w=1. Then 2*(1) +3*(1) +30*0 +45*1=2+3+0+45=50. But again, in the original variables, d=w/m=1/15. So a=Â±1/15, b=Â±1/15, c=0, d=1/15. Then check if (b, d) â 0. Yes, both non-zero. Wait, but in this case, b=Â±1/15 and d=1/15, so they are non-zero. So this would be a valid solution. Wait, but let me check the original equation. The original equation after scaling is 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2/3. Let me plug in a=1/15, b=1/15, c=0, d=1/15. Then:

2*(1/15)^2 +3*(1/15)^2 +30*0 +45*(1/15)^2 = 2/225 +3/225 +0 +45/225 = (2 +3 +45)/225 = 50/225 = 10/45 = 2/9. Wait, that's 2/9, but we needed 2/3. Hmm, so something's wrong here. Wait, but in our scaled equation, we had 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6nÂ². For n=5, that equation is satisfied, but when we convert back to the original variables, it gives 2/9 instead of 2/3. So maybe n=5 is not correct. Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation.

Wait, the original equation after scaling was 6xÂ² +9yÂ² +90zÂ² +135wÂ²=2mÂ². Then we set m=3n, leading to 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6nÂ². So for n=5, we have 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=30. Wait, earlier I thought n=5 gives 6nÂ²=50, but 6*5Â²=150. Wait, no, wait. Wait, m=3n, so 2mÂ²=2*(9nÂ²)=18nÂ². Wait, no, original equation after scaling was 6xÂ² +9yÂ² +90zÂ² +135wÂ²=2mÂ². Then substituting m=3n gives 6xÂ² +9yÂ² +90zÂ² +135wÂ²=2*(9nÂ²)=18nÂ². Then dividing both sides by 3: 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6nÂ². So for n=5, 6nÂ²=150. So 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=150. Let me check the solution I had before. If z=1, w=0: 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=150 -30=120. Let x=Â±2, y=Â±2: 2*4 +3*4=8 +12=20, which is way too small. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me recast.

Wait, when I set z=1, w=0, then 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=150 -30=120. So 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=120. Let me solve this. Let x=10, then 2*100 +3yÂ²=120 => 200 +3yÂ²=120 => 3yÂ²=-80. Impossible. x=5: 2*25 +3yÂ²=120 =>50 +3yÂ²=120 =>3yÂ²=70 =>yÂ²=70/3. Not integer. x=0:3yÂ²=120 =>yÂ²=40. x=Â±6: 2*36 +3yÂ²=72 +3yÂ²=120 =>3yÂ²=48 =>yÂ²=16 =>y=Â±4. So x=Â±6, y=Â±4, z=1, w=0. Then 2*(36) +3*(16) +30*1 +45*0=72 +48 +30 +0=150. Yes, that works. So in the scaled variables, x=Â±6, y=Â±4, z=1, w=0, m=3n=15. So original variables would be a=6/15=2/5, b=4/15, c=1/15, d=0. But d=0 is not allowed. Similarly, if I set z=0, w=1: 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=150 -45=105. Let me solve 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=105. Let x=5: 2*25 +3yÂ²=50 +3yÂ²=105 =>3yÂ²=55 =>yÂ²=55/3. Not integer. x=6: 2*36 +3yÂ²=72 +3yÂ²=105 =>3yÂ²=33 =>yÂ²=11. x=7: 2*49 +3yÂ²=98 +3yÂ²=105 =>3yÂ²=7 =>yÂ²=7/3. x=3: 2*9 +3yÂ²=18 +3yÂ²=105 =>3yÂ²=87 =>yÂ²=29. x=4: 2*16 +3yÂ²=32 +3yÂ²=105 =>3yÂ²=73 =>yÂ²=73/3. x=8: 2*64 +3yÂ²=128 +3yÂ²=105 =>3yÂ²=-23. Impossible. So no solutions here. How about x=9: 2*81=162 >105. So no. So maybe no solutions with w=1. Hmm.

Wait, but earlier when I set n=5, I had a solution where z=1, w=0, but that gives d=0. Similarly, if I set z=0, w=1, no solution. What if I set both z and w non-zero? Let me try z=1, w=1. Then 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=150 -30 -45=75. So 2xÂ² +3yÂ²=75. Let's solve. x=5: 2*25 +3yÂ²=50 +3yÂ²=75 =>3yÂ²=25 =>yÂ²=25/3. x=6: 2*36 +3yÂ²=72 +3yÂ²=75 =>3yÂ²=3 =>y=Â±1. So x=Â±6, y=Â±1, z=1, w=1. Then 2*36 +3*1 +30*1 +45*1=72 +3 +30 +45=150. Yes, that works. So in the scaled variables, x=Â±6, y=Â±1, z=1, w=1, m=15. Then original variables are a=6/15=2/5, b=1/15, c=1/15, d=1/15. Now, check if (b, d) â 0. Yes, both are 1/15. Then plugging into the original equation:

2*(2/5)^2 +3*(1/15)^2 +30*(1/15)^2 +45*(1/15)^2

Compute each term:

2*(4/25) = 8/25

3*(1/225) = 3/225 = 1/75

30*(1/225) = 30/225 = 2/15

45*(1/225) = 45/225 = 1/5

Now, sum them up:

8/25 + 1/75 + 2/15 + 1/5

Convert all to 75 denominators:

8/25 = 24/75

1/75 = 1/75

2/15 = 10/75

1/5 = 15/75

Total: 24 +1 +10 +15 =50/75 = 2/3. Perfect! So this works. So the solution is (a, b, c, d) = (2/5, 1/15, 1/15, 1/15). Let me confirm that all variables are rational. Yes, they are all fractions. Also, (b, d) = (1/15, 1/15) â  (0,0). Therefore, this is a valid solution. Therefore, the answer is yes, such a tuple exists.

Wait, but let me check my calculations again to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Original equation: 2aÂ² +3bÂ² +30cÂ² +45dÂ²=2/3. Plugging in a=2/5, b=1/15, c=1/15, d=1/15:

2*(4/25) = 8/25

3*(1/225) = 3/225 = 1/75

30*(1/225) = 30/225 = 2/15

45*(1/225) = 45/225 = 1/5

Adding them:

8/25 + 1/75 + 2/15 + 1/5

Convert to 75 denominator:

8/25 = 24/75

1/75 = 1/75

2/15 = 10/75

1/5 = 15/75

Total: 24 +1 +10 +15 =50. 50/75 = 2/3. Correct. So this works. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, how did I get this solution? By scaling the variables and finding integers x, y, z, w, m that satisfy the scaled equation. Then converting back to the original variables. So the key was to find integer solutions to 2xÂ² +3yÂ² +30zÂ² +45wÂ²=6nÂ², which I did with x=Â±6, y=Â±1, z=1, w=1, n=5, leading to the rational solution (2/5, 1/15, 1/15, 1/15). Therefore, the answer is yes, such a tuple exists.

To determine whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) such that \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) and \\(2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 = 2\\), we can approach the problem by considering the equation as a quadratic form and checking for rational solutions.

First, we homogenize the equation by introducing a new variable \\(e\\) to form the quadratic equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3b^2 + 30c^2 + 45d^2 - 2e^2 = 0.\\]

By the Hasse-Minkowski theorem, a quadratic form in five variables over \\(\\mathbb{Q}\\) has a non-trivial solution if it has solutions over all \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) and \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). We check for solutions modulo small primes and find that solutions exist modulo 8, 3, and 5, indicating local solutions. 

To find an explicit solution, we consider setting \\(b = 1\\) and \\(d = 1\\). This leads to the equation:
\\[2a^2 + 3 + 45 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 \\implies 2a^2 + 30c^2 = 2e^2 - 48 \\implies a^2 + 15c^2 = e^2 - 24.\\]

Trying specific values, we find that \\(e = 7\\), \\(a = 5\\), and \\(c = 0\\) satisfies the equation:
\\[5^2 + 15 \\cdot 0^2 = 7^2 - 24 \\implies 25 = 49 - 24 \\implies 25 = 25.\\]

This gives the solution \\((a, b, c, d, e) = (5, 1, 0, 1, 7)\\). Scaling back to rational numbers, we divide by \\(e = 7\\) to get:
\\[\\left(\\frac{5}{7}, \\frac{1}{7}, 0, \\frac{1}{7}\\right).\\]

Verifying, we check:
\\[2\\left(\\frac{5}{7}\\right)^2 + 3\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 + 30 \\cdot 0^2 + 45\\left(\\frac{1}{7}\\right)^2 = \\frac{50}{49} + \\frac{3}{49} + \\frac{45}{49} = \\frac{98}{49} = 2.\\]

Thus, there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers \\((a, b, c, d)\\) with \\((b, d) \\neq (0, 0)\\) that satisfies the equation.

\\[
\\boxed{Yes}

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether there exists an ordered 4-tuple of rational numbers (a, b, c, d) where (b, d) isn't both zero, and such that 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² equals 2/3. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

First, the equation given is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. All variables are rational numbers, and at least one of b or d is non-zero. So, essentially, we're looking for non-zero solutions in rational numbers to this quadratic equation. The question is whether such solutions exist.

I remember that equations like these, especially quadratic forms, can sometimes be analyzed using techniques from number theory or algebraic geometry. But since we're dealing with rational numbers, maybe there's a way to find explicit solutions or to argue whether they exist based on some properties.

Let me think. If I can find even one non-zero solution (a, b, c, d) with rational entries, then the answer is yes. If not, maybe we can show that no such solutions exist. But how do I approach this?

One method that comes to mind is scaling. Since we're dealing with rational numbers, perhaps I can set one of the variables to 1 and solve for the others. For example, set b = 1, then solve for a, c, d. But wait, but if I set b = 1, then d could still be zero. The problem only requires that at least one of b or d is non-zero, so even if d is zero, as long as b is non-zero, that's acceptable. Similarly, if I set d = 1 and b = 0, that's also allowed.

Alternatively, maybe setting both b and d to 1 and see if the equation can be satisfied. But the equation is equal to 2/3, which is less than 1. So setting both b and d to 1 would give 3*1 + 45*1 = 48, which is way too big. So that's not going to work. Similarly, even if I set both b and d to 1/3, then 3*(1/3)^2 + 45*(1/3)^2 = 3*(1/9) + 45*(1/9) = (3 + 45)/9 = 48/9 = 16/3, which is still larger than 2/3. So that's not helpful.

Wait, maybe scaling all variables down. Since the equation is homogeneous of degree 2, if we have a solution, we can scale it by a rational number. However, the right-hand side is 2/3, which is not a square. Hmm. Wait, actually, the equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. So if we have a solution, then scaling all variables by a factor t would give 2(t a)^2 + 3(t b)^2 + 30(t c)^2 + 45(t d)^2 = tÂ² * (2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ²) = tÂ² * (2/3). If we set this equal to 2/3, then tÂ² must be 1, so t = Â±1. Therefore, scaling doesn't help here. So maybe we need to find a solution with some specific variables set to certain values.

Alternatively, perhaps we can parameterize the variables. For example, set c = 0 and d = 0, then the equation reduces to 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. Then we can solve for rational a and b. Similarly, if we set a = 0, b = 0, then 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let's check if those simpler equations have solutions.

First, let's check the case where c = 0 and d = 0. Then the equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² = 2/3. Let's try to find rational numbers a and b satisfying this. Let's set a = k and b = m, both rational. Then 2kÂ² + 3mÂ² = 2/3. Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators: 6kÂ² + 9mÂ² = 2. So 6kÂ² + 9mÂ² = 2. Let me see if there are rational solutions here.

Suppose k and m are rational. Let me write k = p/q and m = r/q, where p, q, r are integers with q â  0. Then substitute into the equation:

6*(pÂ²/qÂ²) + 9*(rÂ²/qÂ²) = 2

Multiply both sides by qÂ²:

6pÂ² + 9rÂ² = 2qÂ²

So, 6pÂ² + 9rÂ² = 2qÂ². Let's rearrange: 6pÂ² = 2qÂ² - 9rÂ² â 3pÂ² = qÂ² - (9/2)rÂ². Hmm, but the left side is an integer (since p and q are integers), and the right side is qÂ² minus (9/2)rÂ². For the right side to be an integer, (9/2)rÂ² must be an integer, so rÂ² must be even. Let r = 2s, where s is an integer. Then rÂ² = 4sÂ², so (9/2)*4sÂ² = 18sÂ², which is an integer. Then the equation becomes 3pÂ² = qÂ² - 18sÂ².

So, 3pÂ² + 18sÂ² = qÂ². Let's factor out a 3: 3(pÂ² + 6sÂ²) = qÂ². Therefore, qÂ² must be divisible by 3, so q must be divisible by 3. Let q = 3t, where t is an integer. Then substitute back:

3(pÂ² + 6sÂ²) = (3t)Â² = 9tÂ² â pÂ² + 6sÂ² = 3tÂ².

So, pÂ² + 6sÂ² = 3tÂ². Let's rearrange: pÂ² = 3tÂ² - 6sÂ² = 3(tÂ² - 2sÂ²). Therefore, pÂ² must be divisible by 3, so p must be divisible by 3. Let p = 3u, where u is an integer. Then substitute:

(3u)Â² + 6sÂ² = 3tÂ² â 9uÂ² + 6sÂ² = 3tÂ² â 3uÂ² + 2sÂ² = tÂ².

So now we have 3uÂ² + 2sÂ² = tÂ². Hmm. Let's see if this equation has integer solutions. Let me try small integers. Let's set u = 1. Then 3*1 + 2sÂ² = tÂ² â 2sÂ² = tÂ² - 3. So tÂ² - 2sÂ² = 3. Let's solve for t and s. Let's check t = 2: 4 - 2sÂ² = 3 â 2sÂ² = 1 â sÂ² = 1/2, not integer. t = 3: 9 - 2sÂ² = 3 â 2sÂ² = 6 â sÂ² = 3, not integer. t = 1: 1 - 2sÂ² = 3 â -2sÂ² = 2 â sÂ² = -1, impossible. t = 4: 16 - 2sÂ² = 3 â 2sÂ² = 13 â sÂ² = 13/2, nope. t = 5: 25 - 2sÂ² = 3 â 2sÂ² = 22 â sÂ² = 11, nope. Hmm.

u = 0: 0 + 2sÂ² = tÂ² â tÂ² = 2sÂ² â t = sâ2. But t and s are integers, so s must be 0, leading to t = 0. Then we have p = 0, q = 0, r = 0. But then (a, b) would be (0, 0), which is not allowed. So the only solution here would be trivial, but we need non-zero solutions. Therefore, in this case, there are no non-zero solutions when c = 0 and d = 0. So maybe setting c and d to zero doesn't work.

Alternatively, let's check if setting a = 0 and b = 0. Then the equation becomes 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let's do similar steps. Multiply both sides by 3: 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. Let c = p/q and d = r/q, then 90(pÂ²/qÂ²) + 135(rÂ²/qÂ²) = 2 â 90pÂ² + 135rÂ² = 2qÂ². Divide both sides by common factors. Let's see, 90 and 135 are divisible by 45. 90 = 45*2, 135 = 45*3. So divide both sides by 45:

2pÂ² + 3rÂ² = (2/45)qÂ². Hmm, but 2pÂ² + 3rÂ² must be a multiple of 2/45? Wait, no, the equation is 2pÂ² + 3rÂ² = (2/45)qÂ². Let me rearrange:

Multiply both sides by 45: 90pÂ² + 135rÂ² = 2qÂ². Which is the same as before. Let's try to find integer solutions. Let me set p = 0. Then 135rÂ² = 2qÂ². 135rÂ² must be even, so rÂ² must be even, so r = 2s. Then 135*(4sÂ²) = 2qÂ² â 540sÂ² = 2qÂ² â 270sÂ² = qÂ². Therefore, qÂ² = 270sÂ². 270 factors into 9*30 = 9*2*3*5. So qÂ² = (9*2*3*5)sÂ². Therefore, q must be divisible by 3, 2, 15? Wait, 270 = 2*3^3*5. So qÂ² must have even exponents for primes. Therefore, s must be divisible by 15. Let s = 15t. Then qÂ² = 270*(15t)^2 = 270*225tÂ² = 60750tÂ². So q must be divisible by 15*sqrt(60750). But 60750 is 60750 = 6075*10 = 9*675*10 = 9*9*75*10 = 9*9*25*6. Wait, sqrt(60750) = sqrt(9*9*25*6) = 9*5*sqrt(6) = 45â6. So q = 45â6 t. But q must be an integer, so â6 must divide t, which is an integer. But â6 is irrational, so unless t = 0, there's no solution. Therefore, only the trivial solution where s = 0, leading to r = 0, q = 0. Again, trivial solution. So setting a = 0 and b = 0 also leads only to trivial solutions.

Hmm, so perhaps setting two variables to zero doesn't work. Maybe we need to set one variable to non-zero. Let's try setting c = 0 and d â  0. Then the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let's see if we can find rational numbers a, b, d here.

Alternatively, maybe set a = 0 and b â  0, so 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. Let's try to solve this. Let me set a = 0 and look for solutions. Let me set b = 1, then 3 + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. So 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 - 3 = 2/3 - 9/3 = -7/3. But squares are non-negative, so left side is non-negative, right side is negative. No solution here. So setting b = 1 is bad. Maybe set b = 1/3. Then 3*(1/3)^2 = 3*(1/9) = 1/3. Then 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 - 1/3 = 1/3. So 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 1/3. Multiply both sides by 3: 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 1. Then, similar to before, set c = p/q and d = r/q. Then 90pÂ² + 135rÂ² = qÂ². Which is the same equation as before. Again, leading to qÂ² = 90pÂ² + 135rÂ². Let's try p = 0. Then 135rÂ² = qÂ². So q = 15râ(135)/15? Wait, 135 = 9*15, so sqrt(135) = 3*sqrt(15). So q = 15r*sqrt(15). But q must be integer, so r must be divisible by sqrt(15), which is irrational unless r = 0. So only solution is r = 0, q = 0. Then d = 0, which is not allowed. So again, no solution here.

Alternatively, set c = 1. Wait, but c is a rational number. Let me set c = 1 and see. But 30*(1)^2 + 45dÂ² = 30 + 45dÂ² = 1/3. Then 45dÂ² = 1/3 -30 = -89/3, which is negative. No solution. Similarly, setting c = 1/3. Then 30*(1/3)^2 = 30*(1/9) = 10/3. Then 45dÂ² = 1/3 -10/3 = -9/3 = -3. Again, impossible. So setting c to non-zero seems problematic.

Alternatively, set d = 1. Then 30cÂ² + 45*1 = 30cÂ² +45 = 2/3 -2aÂ² -3bÂ². Wait, but this seems messy. Maybe try to find a non-trivial solution where not all variables are zero. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps scaling variables. Let me assume that a, b, c, d are all rational numbers. Let me write them as fractions: a = x/k, b = y/k, c = z/k, d = w/k, where x, y, z, w, k are integers, k â  0. Then substitute into the equation:

2*(x/k)^2 + 3*(y/k)^2 + 30*(z/k)^2 + 45*(w/k)^2 = 2/3

Multiply both sides by kÂ²:

2xÂ² + 3yÂ² + 30zÂ² + 45wÂ² = (2/3)kÂ²

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:

6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2kÂ²

So now we have the equation 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2kÂ², where x, y, z, w, k are integers, k â  0. Also, (y, w) â  (0, 0). So we need integer solutions to this equation with (y, w) â  (0, 0).

Let me try to find integers x, y, z, w, k satisfying this. Maybe set some variables to zero to simplify. For example, set z = 0 and w = 0. Then the equation becomes 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 2kÂ². Let's look for integer solutions here. Let me divide both sides by common factors. 6, 9, 2 have a common factor of 1. Let me rearrange:

6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 2kÂ² â 3xÂ² + (9/2)yÂ² = kÂ². Hmm, but the left side must be integer. So (9/2)yÂ² must be integer, which implies yÂ² must be even. So y is even. Let y = 2m. Then:

3xÂ² + (9/2)(4mÂ²) = kÂ² â 3xÂ² + 18mÂ² = kÂ². So 3xÂ² + 18mÂ² = kÂ². Let's factor out a 3:

3(xÂ² + 6mÂ²) = kÂ². Therefore, kÂ² must be divisible by 3, so k must be divisible by 3. Let k = 3n. Substitute back:

3(xÂ² + 6mÂ²) = 9nÂ² â xÂ² + 6mÂ² = 3nÂ². Then xÂ² = 3nÂ² - 6mÂ² = 3(nÂ² - 2mÂ²). Therefore, xÂ² must be divisible by 3, so x must be divisible by 3. Let x = 3p. Substitute:

(3p)Â² + 6mÂ² = 3nÂ² â 9pÂ² + 6mÂ² = 3nÂ² â 3pÂ² + 2mÂ² = nÂ².

Now, we have 3pÂ² + 2mÂ² = nÂ². Let's try small integers. Let m = 1. Then 3pÂ² + 2 = nÂ². Let's see: nÂ² - 3pÂ² = 2. Let's try p = 1: nÂ² - 3 = 2 â nÂ² = 5, nope. p = 0: nÂ² = 2, nope. p = 2: nÂ² - 12 = 2 â nÂ² = 14, nope. p = 3: nÂ² - 27 = 2 â nÂ² = 29, nope. Not working.

m = 2: 3pÂ² + 8 = nÂ². So nÂ² - 3pÂ² = 8. Let's try p = 1: nÂ² - 3 = 8 â nÂ² = 11, nope. p = 2: nÂ² - 12 = 8 â nÂ² = 20, nope. p = 3: nÂ² - 27 = 8 â nÂ² = 35, nope. p = 0: nÂ² = 8, nope. Hmm.

m = 3: 3pÂ² + 18 = nÂ². So nÂ² - 3pÂ² = 18. p = 1: 1 - 3 = -2 â  18. p = 2: 4 - 12 = -8 â  18. p = 3: 9 - 27 = -18 â  18. p = 4: 16 - 48 = -32 â  18. Not working.

m = 4: 3pÂ² + 32 = nÂ². Let p = 2: 12 + 32 = 44 = nÂ². 44 isn't a square. p = 3: 27 + 32 = 59, not square. p = 4: 48 + 32 = 80, not square. Not helpful.

m = 5: 3pÂ² + 50 = nÂ². Let p = 5: 75 + 50 = 125, not square. p = 4: 48 + 50 = 98, nope. p = 3: 27 + 50 = 77, nope.

This approach isn't yielding solutions. Maybe set m = 0. Then 3pÂ² = nÂ². So n = pâ3. But p and n are integers, so only possible if p = n = 0. Which gives the trivial solution. But we need non-trivial solutions. So this path seems blocked.

Alternatively, maybe set z and w to non-zero values. Let me try setting z = 1 and w = 1. Then the equation becomes 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90*1 + 135*1 = 2kÂ² â 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 180 + 135 = 2kÂ² â 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 315 = 2kÂ². Hmm, 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 2kÂ² - 315. Since the left side is non-negative, 2kÂ² must be at least 315. So kÂ² â¥ 157.5, so k â¥ 13 (since 12Â² = 144 < 157.5, 13Â² = 169 â¥ 157.5). Let's try k = 13. Then 2kÂ² = 338. So 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 338 - 315 = 23. So 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 23. Let's see if integers x and y satisfy this. Divide by common factor: 6 and 9 have a common factor of 3. So 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² = 23/3. Not integer. So impossible. k = 14: 2kÂ² = 392. 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 392 - 315 = 77. 77 divided by 3 is not integer. 77/3 â 25.666. So 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² = 77/3. Not integer. Similarly, k = 15: 2kÂ² = 450. 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 450 - 315 = 135. 135 divided by 3 is 45. So 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² = 45. Let's solve 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² = 45. Let me try y = 1: 2xÂ² + 3 = 45 â 2xÂ² = 42 â xÂ² = 21, nope. y = 3: 2xÂ² + 27 = 45 â 2xÂ² = 18 â xÂ² = 9 â x = Â±3. So x = 3, y = 3. Then, check: 2*9 + 3*9 = 18 + 27 = 45. Yes. So x = 3, y = 3. Therefore, a = x/k = 3/15 = 1/5, b = y/k = 3/15 = 1/5, c = z/k = 1/15, d = w/k = 1/15. Then check the original equation:

2*(1/5)^2 + 3*(1/5)^2 + 30*(1/15)^2 + 45*(1/15)^2

= 2*(1/25) + 3*(1/25) + 30*(1/225) + 45*(1/225)

= (2 + 3)/25 + (30 + 45)/225

= 5/25 + 75/225

= 1/5 + 1/3

= 3/15 + 5/15 = 8/15. Wait, but we needed this to equal 2/3. Wait, 8/15 is not equal to 2/3. So something's wrong here.

Wait, let's check the substitutions again. When I set z = 1, w = 1, then the equation becomes 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90 + 135 = 2kÂ². So 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 2kÂ² - 315. Then when k = 15, 2kÂ² = 450, so 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 135. Divided by 3: 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² = 45. We found x = 3, y = 3. So a = x/k = 3/15 = 1/5, b = y/k = 3/15 = 1/5, c = z/k = 1/15, d = w/k = 1/15. Then plugging back into original equation:

2*(1/5)^2 + 3*(1/5)^2 + 30*(1/15)^2 + 45*(1/15)^2

= 2*(1/25) + 3*(1/25) + 30*(1/225) + 45*(1/225)

= (2 + 3)/25 + (30 + 45)/225

= 5/25 + 75/225

= 1/5 + 1/3

= (3 + 5)/15 = 8/15. But 8/15 is approximately 0.533..., while we needed 2/3 â 0.666... So this doesn't satisfy the equation. Therefore, even though we found integer solutions to the scaled equation, when we scale back down, it doesn't satisfy the original equation. So this approach doesn't work. Therefore, perhaps setting z and w to 1 isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe there's a scaling factor that I missed. Wait, when we set z = 1 and w = 1, we have to remember that the original equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3. When we set a = x/k, b = y/k, c = z/k, d = w/k, the equation becomes 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90zÂ² + 135wÂ² = 2kÂ². So for the solution we found (x=3, y=3, z=1, w=1, k=15), we have 6*9 + 9*9 + 90*1 + 135*1 = 54 + 81 + 90 + 135 = 360. But 2kÂ² = 2*225 = 450. So 360 â  450. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, when we set z = 1 and w = 1, the equation is 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90*1 + 135*1 = 2kÂ². So 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 2kÂ² - 315. When k = 15, 2kÂ² = 450, so 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 450 - 315 = 135. Then 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 135. Divided by 3: 2xÂ² + 3yÂ² = 45. Then x = 3, y = 3 gives 2*9 + 3*9 = 18 + 27 = 45. So that's correct. But when we translate back to a, b, c, d:

a = x/k = 3/15 = 1/5

b = y/k = 3/15 = 1/5

c = z/k = 1/15

d = w/k = 1/15

But then plugging into original equation:

2*(1/5)^2 + 3*(1/5)^2 + 30*(1/15)^2 + 45*(1/15)^2

= 2*(1/25) + 3*(1/25) + 30*(1/225) + 45*(1/225)

= (2 + 3)/25 + (30 + 45)/225

= 5/25 + 75/225

= 1/5 + 1/3 = 8/15 â 0.533, which is not 2/3. So something is wrong here. Wait, why is this happening?

Because when we set z = 1 and w = 1, we are adding 30*(1/15)^2 + 45*(1/15)^2 = 30*(1/225) + 45*(1/225) = 75/225 = 1/3. But according to the original equation, we need this term plus the others to equal 2/3. But when we have a = 1/5, b = 1/5, then 2*(1/5)^2 + 3*(1/5)^2 = 2/25 + 3/25 = 5/25 = 1/5. Then total is 1/5 + 1/3 = 8/15, which is less than 2/3. So this approach isn't working.

Alternatively, maybe set z and w to different values. Let's try z = 1, w = 0. Then the equation becomes 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² + 90*1 + 0 = 2kÂ² â 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 2kÂ² - 90. Let's set k such that 2kÂ² - 90 is positive. For example, k = 10: 200 - 90 = 110. 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 110. Divide by 2: 3xÂ² + 4.5yÂ² = 55. Not helpful. k = 11: 2*121 - 90 = 152. 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 152. Divide by 1: 6xÂ² + 9yÂ² = 152. Let's try y = 2: 9*4 = 36. 6xÂ² = 152 - 36 = 116 â xÂ² = 116/6 â 19.333. Not integer. y = 4: 9*16 = 144. 6xÂ² = 152 -144 = 8 â xÂ² = 8/6 = 4/3. Not integer. y = 0: 6xÂ² = 152 â xÂ² = 152/6 â 25.333. Not integer. Not helpful.

This trial and error method isn't fruitful. Maybe another approach is needed.

Let me think about scaling the entire equation. Suppose we have a solution (a, b, c, d). Let's scale all variables by a factor t, so (ta, tb, tc, td). Then the equation becomes 2(ta)^2 + 3(tb)^2 + 30(tc)^2 + 45(td)^2 = 2/3. Let's set this equal to (t^2)(2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ²) = tÂ²*(2/3). But we need this to equal 2/3. So unless tÂ² = 1, which would mean t = Â±1, scaling doesn't help. Therefore, scaling can't be used here.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the equation as a quadratic form and check if it represents 2/3 over the rationals. In number theory, a quadratic form can represent a number if there exists a solution in integers (or rationals) to the equation. However, determining whether a quadratic form represents a particular number is non-trivial, especially over the rationals.

Another approach: use the Hasse principle, which states that a quadratic form represents a number over the rationals if and only if it represents the number over the real numbers and over all p-adic numbers. However, since we have a quadratic form in four variables, and we need to check if it represents 2/3 over the rationals. Let's check the real case first. Over the reals, the equation 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3 has solutions, for example, set a = b = c = 0 and d = Â±â(2/(3*45)) = Â±â(2/135). But since we need rational solutions, just real solutions aren't sufficient.

For the p-adic case, we need to check whether the equation has solutions modulo p for all primes p, and then lift them using Hensel's lemma. However, since we are dealing with rational solutions, the Hasse principle would require that the equation has solutions in all p-adic fields and in the real numbers. If it does, then by the Hasse principle, there exists a rational solution. However, if it fails in any p-adic field, then there is no rational solution.

But the Hasse principle is not always true for quadratic forms. For example, for quadratic forms in more than three variables, the Hasse principle holds, but for three variables, it doesn't. Since we have four variables here, the Hasse principle should hold, right? Wait, actually, the Hasse principle for quadratic forms states that a quadratic form represents a number over the rationals if and only if it represents the number over the real numbers and over all p-adic numbers. For quadratic forms in four variables, the Hasse principle does hold. Therefore, if the equation has solutions in the reals and in all p-adic fields, then it has a rational solution.

Since we already know there are real solutions, we need to check for all primes p whether the equation has solutions modulo p. For each prime p, check whether the equation 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² â¡ 2/3 mod p has a solution. Wait, but 2/3 mod p is equivalent to 2*3^{-1} mod p. So we can write the equation as 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² â¡ 2*3^{-1} mod p. Let's compute 3^{-1} mod p for each prime p â  3. For p = 3, we need to handle separately.

First, check p = 2. Compute 3^{-1} mod 2. But 3 â¡ 1 mod 2, so 3^{-1} â¡ 1^{-1} â¡ 1 mod 2. So the equation becomes 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² â¡ 2*1 â¡ 0 mod 2. Let's compute each term mod 2:

2aÂ² â¡ 0 mod 2

3bÂ² â¡ bÂ² mod 2

30cÂ² â¡ 0 mod 2

45dÂ² â¡ dÂ² mod 2

So overall: 0 + bÂ² + 0 + dÂ² â¡ 0 mod 2 â bÂ² + dÂ² â¡ 0 mod 2. Since squares mod 2 are either 0 or 1, the sum bÂ² + dÂ² â¡ 0 mod 2 implies both b and d are even. So set b = 2b', d = 2d'. Then the equation becomes 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 â¡ 0 mod 2. So the equation holds. But we need to check whether there are solutions with (b, d) â  (0,0). Since we can take b' and d' to be arbitrary, but the equation reduces to 0 â¡ 0, which is always true. Therefore, there are solutions mod 2.

Next, p = 3. The equation is 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² â¡ 2*3^{-1} mod 3. Compute 3^{-1} mod 3. But 3 â¡ 0 mod 3, so 3^{-1} doesn't exist. Therefore, we need to handle p=3 separately. Let's look at the original equation mod 3:

2aÂ² + 0 + 0 + 0 â¡ 2/3 mod 3. But 2/3 mod 3 is undefined because 3 divides the denominator. Wait, perhaps better to write the original equation as 2aÂ² + 3bÂ² + 30cÂ² + 45dÂ² = 2/3, and multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators: 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. Now, working mod 3:

6aÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3

9bÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3

90cÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3 (since 90 â¡ 0 mod 3)

135dÂ² â¡ 0 mod 3

So overall, 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 â¡ 2 mod 3 â 0 â¡ 2 mod 3. Which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no solutions modulo 3. Wait, but this contradicts the Hasse principle. If there are no solutions modulo 3, then by the Hasse principle, there are no rational solutions. But according to our earlier check, the equation has real solutions, but it fails modulo 3. Therefore, by the Hasse principle, there are no rational solutions. Therefore, the answer is no.

But wait, let me double-check. When we multiply the original equation by 3, we get 6aÂ² + 9bÂ² + 90cÂ² + 135dÂ² = 2. Then mod 3, all terms are 0, so 0 â¡ 2 mod 3, which is impossible. Therefore, there are no solutions modulo 3, so by the Hasse principle, there are no rational solutions. Therefore, the answer is no, there does not exist such a tuple.

But wait, this contradicts my initial thought that the Hasse principle holds for four variables. Let me confirm the Hasse principle for quadratic forms. The Hasse-Minkowski theorem states that a quadratic form over the rationals represents zero non-trivially if and only if it represents zero non-trivially over the real numbers and over all p-adic numbers. However, our equation is not representing zero, but a specific non-zero value (2/3). So the Hasse principle applies to representing zero, but here we have a non-zero value. So perhaps the Hasse principle doesn't directly apply here.

Wait, but even so, if the equation has solutions over the real numbers and over all p-adic fields, then it should have a rational solution. However, in our case, modulo 3, there are no solutions, so even though there are real solutions, since there are no solutions modulo 3, there are no rational solutions. Therefore, the answer should be no.

Therefore, after this analysis, the conclusion is that there does not exist such a 4-tuple of rational numbers.
