","Okay, so I have this problem here: If f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then I need to show that the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). And I can't use L'Hospital's rule. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, let me recall some calculus concepts. The problem involves a limit that looks similar to the definition of the second derivative. I remember that the second derivative can be defined as the limit of [f''(0)] = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h, but that's the first derivative of the first derivative. Wait, maybe I need to think about the symmetric difference quotient? Because here, we have f(h) and f(-h), so maybe this is a way to approximate the second derivative?

Let me write down the expression again: [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². If I rearrange that, it's [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h². I need to show this limit is f''(0). Since f''(0) exists, f is twice differentiable at 0, right?

Maybe I can use the Taylor expansion of f around 0. If f is twice differentiable at 0, then we can write f(h) as a Taylor series up to the second term. Let's try that.

So, the Taylor expansion of f(h) around 0 is f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Similarly, the Taylor expansion of f(-h) would be f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)² + o((-h)²). Let me compute f(-h):

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Because (-h)² is h², so the second derivative term remains positive. So, adding f(h) and f(-h):

f(h) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)].

Combine like terms:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + [f'(0)h - f'(0)h] + [ (1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² ] + o(h²).

Simplify:

= 2f(0) + 0 + f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Therefore, f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Divide both sides by h²:

[f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h².

As h approaches 0, the term o(h²)/h² goes to 0 because o(h²) represents a function that goes to zero faster than h². Therefore, the limit as h approaches 0 of the left-hand side is f''(0). So that should be the proof.

Wait, but the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. So maybe I need to verify that the Taylor expansion is valid here. Since f''(0) exists, f is twice differentiable at 0, so the Taylor expansion up to the second order with Peano remainder is valid. That is, the remainder term o(h²) is appropriate here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the definition of the derivative. Let me think. If I consider f'(0) as the derivative of f at 0, then f'(0) = lim_{h→0} [f(h) - f(0)] / h. Similarly, f'(-0) = lim_{h→0} [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h). But since f is differentiable at 0, f'(-0) should equal f'(0), so that's okay.

But how does that help me? If I want to relate this to the second derivative, maybe I can consider the derivatives of f(h) and f(-h). Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the mean value theorem. For example, between h and 0, there exists some c such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c)h. Similarly, between -h and 0, there exists some d such that f(-h) - f(0) = f'(d)(-h). Then, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)] = f'(c)h - f'(d)h. So, the numerator is h[f'(c) - f'(d)]. Then, dividing by h² gives [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h.

But then, as h approaches 0, c and d approach 0 as well. So, we have [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h. If f' is differentiable at 0, then f''(0) exists, so f'(x) can be approximated by f'(0) + f''(0)x + o(x). So, f'(c) ≈ f'(0) + f''(0)c and f'(d) ≈ f'(0) + f''(0)d. Then, [f'(c) - f'(d)] ≈ f''(0)(c - d). So, [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h ≈ f''(0)(c - d)/h.

But c and d are points between 0 and h, or 0 and -h. For example, c is in (0, h) and d is in (-h, 0). So, c ≈ h and d ≈ -h as h approaches 0? Wait, maybe not exactly, but they are approaching 0. But how does c - d relate to h?

Wait, if c is in (0, h) and d is in (-h, 0), then c is approximately h and d is approximately -h. So, c - d ≈ h - (-h) = 2h. Therefore, [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h ≈ f''(0)(2h)/h = 2f''(0). But then, the limit would be 2f''(0), which contradicts the problem statement. Hmm, so maybe this approach is flawed.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the difference f'(c) - f'(d) more carefully. Let me try to express c and d in terms of h. If we have f(h) - f(0) = f'(c)h, then c = 0 + θh for some θ between 0 and 1 by the Mean Value Theorem. Similarly, for f(-h) - f(0) = f'(d)(-h), so d = 0 + θ(-h) for some θ between 0 and 1. Wait, no, the Mean Value Theorem between -h and 0 would give d = 0 + θ(-h) where θ is between 0 and 1. So, d = -θh. Therefore, c = θ1 h and d = -θ2 h for θ1, θ2 in (0,1).

Then, f'(c) - f'(d) ≈ f'(θ1 h) - f'(-θ2 h). If f' is differentiable at 0, then f'(θ1 h) ≈ f'(0) + f''(0)θ1 h and f'(-θ2 h) ≈ f'(0) + f''(0)(-θ2 h). Therefore, f'(c) - f'(d) ≈ [f'(0) + f''(0)θ1 h] - [f'(0) - f''(0)θ2 h] = f''(0)(θ1 + θ2)h. Then, [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h ≈ f''(0)(θ1 + θ2). As h approaches 0, θ1 and θ2 are between 0 and 1, so θ1 + θ2 is between 0 and 2. But unless θ1 and θ2 converge to specific values, this term might not necessarily go to 1. Hmm, so this approach might not directly give the correct result. Therefore, maybe the Mean Value Theorem approach isn't the best here.

Going back to the Taylor series approach, that seems more straightforward. Since f is twice differentiable at 0, the expansion is valid. Let me verify that again.

If f''(0) exists, then f is twice differentiable at 0, so the Taylor expansion with Peano remainder is:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

and similarly,

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Adding these gives:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore,

f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Dividing both sides by h²:

[f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, o(h²)/h² approaches 0, so the limit is f''(0). Therefore, the proof is complete.

But wait, the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Does being differentiable mean that f is once differentiable? If f is twice differentiable at 0, then the Taylor expansion up to the second term is valid. However, maybe the problem is assuming that f is only once differentiable, but f''(0) exists. Hmm.

Wait, if f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, does that imply that f is twice differentiable at 0? Because the second derivative is the derivative of the first derivative. So, if f''(0) exists, then f' is differentiable at 0, so f is twice differentiable at 0. Therefore, the Taylor expansion is valid. So, the approach with the Taylor series should work.

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of the derivative more directly. Let's consider the difference quotient.

Let me write the given expression as [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h². Let me factor out the 1/h²:

= [f(h) - f(0) - (f(0) - f(-h))]/h²

But f(h) - f(0) is the forward difference, and f(0) - f(-h) is the backward difference. Maybe I can write this as [f(h) - f(0)]/h² + [f(0) - f(-h)]/h². Wait, but that would be [f(h) - f(0)]/h² + [f(0) - f(-h)]/h² = [f(h) - f(-h)]/(2h²). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, think of the expression as [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me write this as [ (f(h) - f(0)) - (f(0) - f(-h)) ] / h². Then, this is equal to [ (f(h) - f(0)) - (f(0) - f(-h)) ] / h². Let me denote the forward difference as D_h f = f(h) - f(0) and the backward difference as D_{-h} f = f(0) - f(-h). Then, the expression becomes [D_h f - D_{-h} f] / h².

But how does this relate to the second derivative? The second derivative is the limit of [ (f(h) - f(0)) / h - (f(0) - f(-h)) / h ] / h. Wait, that's [ (D_h f - D_{-h} f)/h ] / h = (D_h f - D_{-h} f)/h². So, that is exactly our original expression. Therefore, the limit is the second derivative. But wait, that's circular because the standard definition of the second derivative is indeed using the symmetric difference quotient. But maybe the problem wants a more rigorous proof without relying on that definition.

Alternatively, let me consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the definition of the derivative. For example, f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) as h approaches 0. Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)^2 + o((-h)^2) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Adding these two equations:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²). Dividing by h²:

[f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h². Taking the limit as h approaches 0, the second term goes to 0, so the limit is f''(0). So, this seems to check out.

But perhaps I should verify the expansion more carefully. Let me recall that if a function is twice differentiable at a point, then the Taylor expansion up to the second order is valid with the remainder term o(h²). So, since f''(0) exists, f is twice differentiable at 0, so the expansion is valid. Therefore, substituting the expansions into the given expression gives the desired result.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the definition of the derivative twice. Let me see. Let's consider the limit [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me write this as [f(h) - f(0) - (f(0) - f(-h))] / h². Then, this is equal to [f(h) - f(0)]/h² + [f(-h) - f(0)]/(-h²). Wait, let's see:

[f(h) - f(0)]/h² + [f(0) - f(-h)]/h² = [f(h) - f(0) + f(0) - f(-h)] / h² = [f(h) - f(-h)] / h². Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, factor out 1/h²: [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f(h) - f(0) - (f(0) - f(-h))]/h² = [f(h) - f(0)]/h² - [f(0) - f(-h)]/h².

But [f(h) - f(0)]/h² is the same as [f(h) - f(0)]/h * 1/h, which is [f'(0) + o(1)] * 1/h, but as h approaches 0, 1/h goes to infinity, so this term might not exist unless we have higher-order terms. But since we have f''(0), maybe we need to expand further.

Wait, if I write [f(h) - f(0)] as f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²), then [f(h) - f(0)]/h² = f'(0)/h + (1/2)f''(0) + o(1)/h. But this seems problematic because f'(0)/h would blow up as h approaches 0. Similarly, [f(0) - f(-h)]/h² = [ -f(-h) + f(0) ] / h² = [ f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) ] / h² = f'(0)/h + (1/2)f''(0) + o(1)/h. Therefore, combining these two terms:

[f(h) - f(0)]/h² - [f(0) - f(-h)]/h² = [f'(0)/h + (1/2)f''(0) + o(1)/h] - [f'(0)/h + (1/2)f''(0) + o(1)/h] = 0. But that can't be right because the original limit is supposed to be f''(0). So, clearly, this approach is not working. Maybe splitting the expression like this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the expression as a symmetric second difference quotient. The symmetric second difference quotient is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h², and it's known that the limit as h approaches 0 of this expression is f''(0) if f''(0) exists. But the problem is asking to prove that, so I need to show it without assuming that.

Given that, perhaps the Taylor expansion is the most straightforward method. Let me check again.

If f is twice differentiable at 0, then:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Adding them:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Dividing by h²:

[f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

Taking the limit as h approaches 0:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0) + lim_{h→0} o(h²)/h² = f''(0) + 0 = f''(0)

Therefore, the limit is indeed f''(0). So, this seems to work.

But let me check if there's another way to approach this without using Taylor series, just to be thorough. Maybe using the definition of the derivative and some algebraic manipulation.

Let me consider the function g(x) = f(x) - f(-x). Then, g'(x) = f'(x) + f'(-x) and g''(x) = f''(x) - f''(-x). But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, consider the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me denote this as L(h). Let me see if I can express L(h) in terms of the first derivatives.

If I write f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) and similarly for f(-h), then substituting gives:

L(h) = [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [ (f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)) - 2f(0) + (f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)) ] / h²

Simplify numerator:

f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) - 2f(0) + f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Combine like terms:

(f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0)) + (f'(0)h - f'(0)h) + ( (1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² ) + (o(h²) + o(h²))

Simplifies to:

0 + 0 + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, numerator is f''(0)h² + o(h²), so L(h) = [f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h². As h→0, o(h²)/h²→0, so lim L(h) = f''(0). Therefore, this confirms the result.

Alternatively, perhaps using the definition of the second derivative. The standard definition of the second derivative is f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But since we have to avoid using L'Hospital's rule, maybe this isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the first derivative and integrating the remainder. But that might complicate things. The Taylor series approach seems the most straightforward here.

Let me also check an example. Suppose f(x) = x². Then f''(0) = 2. Let's compute the limit:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [h² - 0 + h²] / h² = 2h² / h² = 2. Which matches f''(0) = 2. Another example: f(x) = x³. Then f''(0) = 0. Let's compute:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [h³ - 0 + (-h)^3] / h² = [h³ - h³]/h² = 0 / h² = 0. Which matches f''(0) = 0. Another example: f(x) = sin(x). Then f''(0) = -sin(0) = 0. Compute:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [sin h - 0 + sin(-h)] / h² = [sin h - sin h] / h² = 0 / h² = 0. Correct. Another example: f(x) = e^x. Then f''(0) = e^0 = 1. Compute:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [e^h - 2 + e^{-h}] / h². Expand e^h and e^{-h} using Taylor series:

e^h = 1 + h + h²/2 + h³/6 + ...
e^{-h} = 1 - h + h²/2 - h³/6 + ...
Adding them: 2 + h² + o(h²). So, numerator is 2 + h² + o(h²) - 2 = h² + o(h²). Divide by h²: 1 + o(1). Therefore, limit is 1, which is f''(0) = 1. So examples check out.

Therefore, the Taylor series approach works, and the limit is indeed f''(0). Therefore, the proof is complete.

","Okay, so I need to show that if a function f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). And I can't use L'Hospital's rule, so I have to think of another way. Hmm. Let me start by recalling some calculus concepts.

First, since f''(0) exists, that means f is twice differentiable at 0. I remember that Taylor series expansions might be useful here. Let me try expanding f(h) and f(-h) around 0 using the Taylor series up to the second order term.

The Taylor series for f(h) around 0 is f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Similarly, for f(-h), it would be f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Let me write that down:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Now, if I add these two expansions together:

f(h) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Simplifying the terms:

= 2f(0) + 2*(1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Which simplifies to:

= 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

So, f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Now, the expression we have in the numerator is f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h). Let me rearrange the terms:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(h) + f(-h)] - 2f(0) = [2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, the numerator simplifies to f''(0)h² + o(h²). Now, dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, the term o(h²)/h² tends to 0 because o(h²) represents terms that go to zero faster than h². Therefore, the limit becomes f''(0) + 0 = f''(0). So the limit is f''(0). That seems to work.

Wait, but let me check if I did everything correctly. Did I use the right expansions? Let me verify again. For f(h), the expansion is correct up to the second order. Similarly for f(-h), replacing h with -h. The cross terms with f'(0)h and -f'(0)h cancel each other when we add them. Then the f''(0)h² terms add up to 2*(1/2)f''(0)h², which is f''(0)h². Then subtracting 2f(0) leaves f''(0)h². Dividing by h² gives f''(0) plus the o(h²)/h² term, which goes to zero. So yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the definition of the derivative. Let me think. The limit given is similar to the second derivative's definition. The second derivative at 0 is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But how does that relate to the given expression?

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of the second derivative as the limit of the difference quotient of the first derivative. But since f''(0) exists, maybe we can express the given limit in terms of the first derivative's difference quotient.

Alternatively, another approach: Let me consider the expression f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h). This resembles the central difference formula for the second derivative. For a function f, the second derivative at a point is often approximated by [f(x+h) - 2f(x) + f(x-h)] / h². So in this case, x is 0, so it's [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Therefore, the limit as h approaches 0 of this expression should be the second derivative at 0, which is exactly what we need to show.

But the problem says to prove this without using L'Hospital's rule. The approach I initially took using Taylor series seems valid and doesn't involve L'Hospital, so that should be acceptable.

Wait, but let me check if the Taylor series approach is permissible here. The problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. So f is twice differentiable at 0, but is it twice differentiable everywhere? Not necessarily, but since we are only interested in the behavior near 0, the Taylor expansion around 0 is valid. The expansion up to the second term is allowed because f''(0) exists. Therefore, the expansion is correct.

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of derivatives directly. Let's try that.

First, let's recall that the second derivative at 0 can be defined as:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But we need to relate this to the given limit. Let's see. The given limit is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Maybe we can express this in terms of the first derivatives.

Let me consider the difference f(h) - f(0) and f(-h) - f(0). For the first, f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) by the Taylor expansion. Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) = -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). So, adding these two:

[f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)] = [f'(0)h - f'(0)h] + [ (1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² ] + o(h²)

Which simplifies to f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, the numerator [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] is equal to f''(0)h² + o(h²), so dividing by h² gives f''(0) + o(h²)/h², and the limit as h approaches 0 is f''(0). This is the same result as before.

Alternatively, let's try not using the Taylor expansion and see if we can derive it another way. Suppose we define the difference quotient for the second derivative. Let me think.

Let me consider the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let's denote this as L. We need to show that L approaches f''(0) as h approaches 0.

Let me consider the first derivative at 0. The derivative f'(0) is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - f(0)] / h. Similarly, the derivative from the left is [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h) as h approaches 0. But since f is differentiable at 0, the left and right derivatives are equal, so lim_{h→0} [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h) = f'(0). Therefore, lim_{h→0} [f(-h) - f(0)] / h = -f'(0).

But how does that help us here? Let's see. Let's rewrite the numerator:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)]

So, the numerator is the sum of the right increment and the left increment. Let's denote A = f(h) - f(0) and B = f(-h) - f(0). Then the expression is (A + B)/h².

Expressed in terms of derivatives:

A = [f(h) - f(0)] = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

B = [f(-h) - f(0)] = -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, A + B = [f'(0)h - f'(0)h] + [ (1/2 + 1/2 )f''(0)h² ] + o(h²) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Thus, (A + B)/h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h², and as h approaches 0, the second term goes to zero, so the limit is f''(0).

This seems to be another way of writing the same reasoning, but still relies on the Taylor expansion. So maybe that's unavoidable here. Alternatively, can we use the definition of the derivative twice?

Let me try another approach. Let's consider the difference quotient for the second derivative. The second derivative is the derivative of the first derivative. So, f''(0) = lim_{k→0} [f'(k) - f'(0)] / k.

But how can we relate this to the given limit? Let's see.

First, let's express the given limit:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the first-order Taylor expansion. Since f is differentiable, f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h), and f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h). Adding these:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + o(h) + o(h) = 2f(0) + o(h)

But then [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = [2f(0) + o(h)] - 2f(0) = o(h). Dividing by h² gives o(h)/h² = o(1/h). But as h approaches 0, 1/h goes to infinity, so this seems problematic. But this contradicts our previous result. Wait, but this can't be right. So where is the mistake here?

Ah, because if we only use the first-order expansion, the numerator becomes o(h), but when we divide by h², it becomes o(h)/h² = o(1/h), which would go to zero? Wait, but o(h) is a term that goes to zero faster than h. So o(h)/h² is a term that goes to zero faster than h²/h² = 1. So actually, o(h)/h² = o(1/h). Hmm, but 1/h goes to infinity as h approaches 0, but o(1/h) would go to zero because it's faster than 1/h. Wait, that might not be the case. Let me recall that o(g(h)) is a term that satisfies lim_{h→0} o(g(h))/g(h) = 0. So if we have o(h)/h², then let's set g(h) = h². Then o(h)/h² = o(h)/h². Let's write o(h) as h*k(h), where k(h) → 0 as h→0. Then o(h)/h² = [h*k(h)] / h² = k(h)/h. Then lim_{h→0} k(h)/h = lim 0/h = 0, since k(h) approaches 0. Therefore, o(h)/h² tends to 0. So in that case, the limit would be 0 + 0 = 0? But that's conflicting with our previous result. So this approach is wrong because we didn't consider the higher-order terms.

Therefore, using only the first-order Taylor expansion is insufficient. We need to go to the second-order term to capture the non-zero limit. Hence, the previous approach with the second-order expansion was necessary.

Therefore, the correct method is to use the Taylor expansion up to the second order term, which allows us to capture the f''(0)h² term in the numerator, leading to the correct limit.

Alternatively, another approach is to use the definition of the derivative twice. Let me try that.

First, let's define the difference quotient:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me factor out 1/h²:

= lim_{h→0} [ (f(h) - f(0) - f'(0)h) + (f(-h) - f(0) + f'(0)h) ] / h²

Wait, maybe not. Let's see. Let me write f(h) - f(0) as approximately f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h², and similarly for f(-h). Then, f(h) - f(0) ≈ f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h², so f(h) - f'(0)h ≈ (1/2)f''(0)h². Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) ≈ -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h², so f(-h) + f'(0)h ≈ (1/2)f''(0)h². Therefore, adding these two results:

[f(h) - f'(0)h + f(-h) + f'(0)h] ≈ (1/2 + 1/2)f''(0)h² = f''(0)h²

But then, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(h) - f(0) - f'(0)h] + [f(-h) - f(0) + f'(0)h] ≈ (1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² = f''(0)h²

Therefore, the expression becomes f''(0)h² / h² = f''(0). So this is the same result. Therefore, by using the approximations of the first derivative and the second derivative, we can derive the limit.

Alternatively, using the definition of the derivative for the second derivative. Let me recall that:

f''(0) = lim_{k→0} [f'(k) - f'(0)] / k

But we need to relate this to the given limit. Let's see. The given limit is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me consider expanding this expression in terms of the first derivatives.

First, note that:

f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) - f(0) = -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Adding these two equations:

[f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)] = [f'(0)h - f'(0)h] + [ (1/2 + 1/2 )f''(0)h² ] + o(h²)

Simplifying:

= f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, the term o(h²)/h² tends to 0, so the limit is f''(0). This is the same conclusion as before.

Alternatively, let's try using the definition of the derivative without expanding. Let's denote the given expression as L:

L = lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me consider the difference quotient for the second derivative. The second derivative is the derivative of the first derivative. So, f''(0) = lim_{k→0} [f'(k) - f'(0)] / k

But how can we relate this to L? Let's see. Let's consider the first derivative f'(0). We know that f'(0) = lim_{h→0} [f(h) - f(0)] / h. Similarly, the derivative from the left is lim_{h→0} [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h) = f'(0). So, we can write:

f'(h) = [f(h) - f(0)] / h + o(1)

Similarly, f'(-h) = [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h) + o(1)

But I'm not sure if this helps directly. Let me try to express the numerator of L in terms of f'(h) and f'(-h).

We can write:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)]

= h[f'(0) + (1/2)f''(0)h + o(h)] + [-h][f'(0) + (1/2)f''(0)h + o(h)]

Wait, this seems similar to expanding f(h) and f(-h) again. Let me compute this step by step.

From the first-order expansion with remainder:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Similarly,

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore,

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Simplifying term by term:

= f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) - 2f(0) + f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Combine like terms:

f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) = 0

f'(0)h - f'(0)h = 0

(1/2 + 1/2)f''(0)h² = f''(0)h²

o(h²) + o(h²) = o(h²)

Therefore, numerator simplifies to f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Divide by h²:

[f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, o(h²)/h² approaches 0, so the limit is f''(0). Thus, this method works.

Alternatively, let's consider the definition of the second derivative using limits. The second derivative at 0 can be defined as:

f''(0) = lim_{k→0} [f'(k) - f'(0)] / k

If I can relate this to the given limit, then I can show the equivalence.

First, let's compute the given limit:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me write this as lim_{h→0} [ (f(h) - f(0)) - (f(0) - f(-h)) ] / h²

= lim_{h→0} [ (f(h) - f(0)) / h² - (f(0) - f(-h)) / h² ]

= lim_{h→0} [ (f(h) - f(0)) / h² - (f(0) - f(-h)) / h² ]

Let me consider the first term: (f(h) - f(0))/h². This can be written as [f(h) - f(0) - f'(0)h + f'(0)h]/h² = [ (f(h) - f(0) - f'(0)h) + f'(0)h ] / h² = [o(h) + f'(0)h ] / h² = f'(0)/h + o(h)/h². But as h approaches 0, f'(0)/h would go to infinity unless f'(0)=0, which isn't necessarily the case. Similarly, the second term (f(0) - f(-h))/h² = [ - (f(-h) - f(0)) ] / h² = [ - ( -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) ) ] / h² = [ f'(0)h - (1/2)f''(0)h² - o(h²) ] / h² = f'(0)/h - (1/2)f''(0) - o(h²)/h². So each term individually goes to infinity or has terms that might cancel out. So this approach might not be straightforward.

Therefore, breaking the numerator into two parts might not be helpful here. Instead, combining them gives a cancellation of the first-order terms, as we saw earlier, leading to the correct result.

Alternatively, using the Mean Value Theorem. Let me think. For the first derivative, we can apply the Mean Value Theorem to f(h) - f(0). There exists a point c in (0, h) such that f'(c) = [f(h) - f(0)] / h. Similarly, for f(-h) - f(0), there exists a point d in (-h, 0) such that f'(d) = [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h). But since f is differentiable at 0, as h approaches 0, c and d approach 0. So f'(c) approaches f'(0) and f'(d) approaches f'(0). Therefore, [f(h) - f(0)] / h = f'(c) ≈ f'(0) + f''(0)(c - 0) + o(c - 0) = f'(0) + f''(0)c + o(c). Similarly for the other term: [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h) = f'(d) ≈ f'(0) + f''(0)d + o(d). Therefore, [f(h) - f(0)] = h[f'(0) + f''(0)c + o(c)] and [f(-h) - f(0)] = -h[f'(0) + f''(0)d + o(d)]. Adding these:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = h[f'(0) + f''(0)c + o(c)] - h[f'(0) + f''(0)d + o(d)]

= h[f'(0) - f'(0) + f''(0)c - f''(0)d + o(c) - o(d)]

= h[f''(0)(c - d) + o(c) - o(d)]

But c and d are between 0 and h (or between -h and 0). As h approaches 0, c and d also approach 0. So, c - d is approximately h - (-h) = 2h, but actually, c is near h and d is near -h, so c - d is approximately h - (-h) = 2h. Wait, but c is in (0, h), so c = h * t where t ∈ (0,1). Similarly, d is in (-h, 0), so d = -h * s where s ∈ (0,1). Therefore, c - d = h*t - (-h*s) = h(t + s). Therefore, c - d is approximately 2h when t and s are both approaching 1. But this is vague.

Alternatively, since c and d approach 0 as h approaches 0, we can write c = h * t and d = -h * s where t and s are between 0 and 1. Then, c - d = h(t + s). Therefore, f''(0)(c - d) = f''(0)h(t + s). Then, the expression becomes:

h[f''(0)h(t + s) + o(h) + o(h)] = h²[f''(0)(t + s) + o(1) + o(1)]

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = h²[f''(0)(t + s) + o(1)]

Dividing by h² gives f''(0)(t + s) + o(1). As h approaches 0, t and s approach 1 (since c approaches h and d approaches -h), so t + s approaches 2. Therefore, the expression becomes 2f''(0) + o(1). Wait, but this contradicts our previous result. Hmm, this suggests there's a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps this approach isn't correct. Let me check again.

Wait, using the Mean Value Theorem, we have:

[f(h) - f(0)] = f'(c)h

[f(-h) - f(0)] = f'(d)(-h)

So, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = f'(c)h - f'(d)h = h[f'(c) - f'(d)]

Then, the expression becomes:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h

Now, we can write f'(c) - f'(d) = f'(d + (c - d)) - f'(d). Let's set k = c - d. Then, f'(d + k) - f'(d). By the Mean Value Theorem again, this is equal to f''(e)k for some e between d and d + k. Therefore, [f'(c) - f'(d)] = f''(e)k. Therefore, the expression becomes:

[f''(e)k] / h

But k = c - d. Since c is in (0, h) and d is in (-h, 0), then k = c - d is in (-h, 2h). Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe we can bound k.

Since c ∈ (0, h) and d ∈ (-h, 0), then k = c - d ∈ (-h, 2h). So, as h approaches 0, k approaches 0. Therefore, e is between d and d + k, which is between -h and 0 + 2h, so e approaches 0 as h approaches 0. Therefore, f''(e) approaches f''(0). Therefore, [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h = [f''(e)k] / h. But k = c - d, which is equal to h*t - (-h*s) = h(t + s), where t ∈ (0,1) and s ∈ (0,1). Therefore, k = h(t + s), so [f''(e)k]/h = f''(e)(t + s). As h approaches 0, e approaches 0, so f''(e) approaches f''(0). Therefore, the expression becomes f''(0)(t + s). But t and s are between 0 and 1, so t + s is between 0 and 2. However, this doesn't necessarily approach a specific value unless we can show that t + s approaches 1. Wait, but this seems like a dead end because t and s can vary between 0 and 1 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, this approach might not be the correct way to handle it. The Mean Value Theorem approach here seems to complicate things rather than simplify, because we end up with variables t and s that can vary as h approaches 0.

Therefore, going back, the most straightforward method is the Taylor expansion, which directly gives the result without ambiguity. Thus, the limit is indeed f''(0).

Another way to think about it: Since f''(0) exists, the function f is twice differentiable at 0, so it has a quadratic approximation:

f(h) ≈ f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h²

Similarly,

f(-h) ≈ f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h²

Adding these:

f(h) + f(-h) ≈ 2f(0) + f''(0)h²

Subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) ≈ f''(0)h²

Dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² ≈ f''(0)

Therefore, the limit as h approaches 0 is f''(0). This is a concise version of the previous reasoning.

In summary, using the Taylor series expansion of f around 0 up to the second order term allows us to cancel out the linear terms involving f'(0)h and f'(-h)h, leaving only the quadratic term involving f''(0)h². Dividing by h² and taking the limit as h approaches 0 gives f''(0), as required.

","Okay, so I need to show that if f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared is equal to f''(0). And I can't use L'Hospital's rule. Hmm, let's see. 

First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving derivatives, Taylor expansions or maybe using the definition of the derivative could be helpful. Since f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, that means f is twice differentiable at 0, right? So maybe I can expand f(h) and f(-h) using the Taylor series around 0 up to the second order term. That should help cancel out some terms when I subtract 2f(0) and divide by h squared.

Let me recall the Taylor expansion formula. For a function f that's twice differentiable at a point, we can write f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + (1/2)f''(a)(x - a)^2 + o((x - a)^2). In this case, we're expanding around a = 0, so f(h) ≈ f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2). Similarly, f(-h) would be f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)^2 + o(h^2). Let me write that out:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)
f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)

Now, if I subtract 2f(0) from both, let's see:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)]

Let me compute each term:

First, f(h) - 2f(0) is [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)] - 2f(0) = -f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)

Then adding f(-h): [-f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)] + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)]

Now, let's combine like terms:

- f(0) + f(0) = 0
f'(0)h - f'(0)h = 0
(1/2)f''(0)h^2 + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 = f''(0)h^2
o(h^2) + o(h^2) = o(h^2)

So overall, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)

Therefore, when we divide by h^2, we get [f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)] / h^2 = f''(0) + o(h^2)/h^2

Now, as h approaches 0, the term o(h^2)/h^2 goes to 0 because o(h^2) represents a function that goes to zero faster than h^2. So the limit should be f''(0). That seems straightforward, but wait, the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Do I need to be careful here?

The Taylor expansion approach assumes that the function is twice differentiable in a neighborhood around 0, not just at 0. But the problem only states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Hmm. Is the existence of f''(0) sufficient for the second-order Taylor expansion? Or do I need more regularity?

Wait, maybe I can approach this using the definition of the second derivative. The second derivative at 0 is defined as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But how does that connect to the given limit?

Alternatively, maybe I can express f(h) and f(-h) using the definition of the derivative. Let's see. Let's try expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the first-order Taylor expansion with the remainder term.

So, f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h)
f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + o(h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h)

Then, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h)] = 0 + o(h) + o(h) = o(h)

But then, if we divide that by h^2, we get o(h)/h^2 = o(1/h), which would go to 0, but that contradicts the desired result. So clearly, using only the first-order expansion isn't sufficient. Therefore, we need to include the second derivative term. But the problem only states that f''(0) exists. So perhaps the higher-order terms are handled by the existence of the second derivative?

Wait, maybe the key is that even if the function isn't twice differentiable everywhere, as long as the second derivative exists at 0, we can still write the expansion up to the second order. Let me check.

Suppose that f''(0) exists. Then, the definition of f''(0) is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But to get the expansion of f(h), maybe we need to use the mean value theorem or something.

Alternatively, perhaps using the definition of the derivative for the second derivative. Let's see. Let's recall that if f''(0) exists, then f' is differentiable at 0, so f'(h) = f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Therefore, f'(h) - f'(0) = f''(0)h + o(h), which is consistent with the definition of f''(0).

But how does this help us with the original limit? Let's try to express f(h) in terms of f(0) and f'(0). Let's integrate f'(t) from 0 to h. Wait, but if we don't know anything about f' except at 0, maybe that's not straightforward.

Alternatively, let's use the fundamental theorem of calculus for the first derivative. Since f'(0) exists, we can write f(h) = f(0) + ∫₀ʰ f'(t) dt. Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) + ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt. Then, f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + ∫₀ʰ f'(t) dt + ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt.

But ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt = -∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt. Let me make a substitution u = -t, so du = -dt. Then, ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt = ∫₀^{h} f'(-u) (-du) = -∫₀^{h} f'(-u) du. Hmm, so f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + ∫₀ʰ f'(t) dt - ∫₀^{h} f'(-u) du. Therefore, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = ∫₀ʰ [f'(t) - f'(-t)] dt.

But I don't know if that helps directly. Alternatively, maybe we can use symmetry. Let me consider the expression f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h). This is similar to the second difference quotient, which is related to the second derivative.

Alternatively, let's consider the difference quotient for the second derivative. The second derivative is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. If we can express the given limit in terms of this.

Wait, let's go back to the original problem. Let me try to compute the given limit step by step.

We have:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me denote this limit as L. So,

L = lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me split the numerator:

= lim_{h→0} [f(h) - f(0) - f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

= lim_{h→0} [ (f(h) - f(0)) - (f(0) - f(-h)) ] / h²

Wait, maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) around 0 using the second-order Taylor polynomial with the remainder term. Since f''(0) exists, even if f'' isn't defined everywhere, at least near 0, we can write:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)
f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Adding these two equations:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

Taking the limit as h→0:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + lim_{h→0} o(h²)/h²

But lim_{h→0} o(h²)/h² = 0, since o(h²) is a term that goes to zero faster than h². Therefore, the limit is f''(0). 

Wait, but earlier I thought that maybe the Taylor expansion requires f to be twice differentiable in a neighborhood around 0, not just at 0. However, the problem only states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. So is the existence of f''(0) sufficient for the second-order expansion? Let me check.

The existence of the second derivative at a point doesn't necessarily imply that the function is twice differentiable in a neighborhood around that point, but in this case, we only need the expansion up to the second order at the point 0. The definition of the second derivative only requires the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h, which exists. Therefore, even if f' isn't differentiable everywhere, as long as the limit defining f''(0) exists, we can still write the expansion:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Similarly for f(-h). Therefore, the previous steps should hold. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the definition of the second derivative directly. Let's see. Let's write f''(0) as the limit as h→0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. If I can relate this to the given limit.

But how? Let's see. Let's start from the given limit expression:

L = lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

If I can express this in terms of the first derivatives. Let's consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the first-order terms and see what remains.

From the first-order expansions:

f(h) ≈ f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h)
f(-h) ≈ f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h)

Adding these:

f(h) + f(-h) ≈ 2f(0) + o(h) + o(h) = 2f(0) + o(h)

Subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) ≈ o(h)

Dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² ≈ o(h)/h² = o(1/h)

But as h approaches 0, o(1/h) would go to zero, which would imply L = 0. But this contradicts the desired result unless f''(0) is zero. Therefore, this approach is insufficient because we need higher-order terms to capture the second derivative.

Therefore, we must consider the second-order terms in the expansion. Even though the problem only states that f''(0) exists, the existence of the second derivative at 0 allows us to include the second-order term in the expansion. Therefore, the initial approach using the Taylor expansion is valid here.

Another way to think about this is using the definition of the derivative. Let's consider the difference quotient for the second derivative. The second derivative at 0 can be written as the limit:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But how do we connect this to the given limit? Let's try to express the given limit in terms of derivatives.

Let me write the given limit again:

L = lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me consider the numerator: f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h). Let's think of this as a symmetric difference quotient. If I recall, the symmetric difference quotient for the second derivative is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². So, indeed, this is a standard expression for the second derivative. Therefore, if f''(0) exists, then this limit should equal f''(0). But why is that the case?

Perhaps we can use the mean value theorem or the definition of the second derivative. Let's try to express f(h) and f(-h) in terms of their derivatives.

Since f is differentiable, we can write:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + ε₁(h)h, where lim_{h→0} ε₁(h) = 0

Similarly,

f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + ε₂(-h)(-h), where lim_{h→0} ε₂(-h) = 0

Therefore,

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + ε₁(h)h

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h - ε₂(-h)h

Adding these:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + ε₁(h)h - ε₂(-h)h

Subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [ε₁(h) - ε₂(-h)] h

Dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [ε₁(h) - ε₂(-h)] / h

But as h approaches 0, both ε₁(h) and ε₂(-h) approach 0. However, the expression [ε₁(h) - ε₂(-h)] / h is of the form [o(1) - o(1)] / h, which is o(1)/h. But this seems like it would approach 0, unless there is more structure.

Wait, maybe this approach is missing something. Let's think again. If we use the second-order expansions, we have:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Then, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Dividing by h² gives f''(0) + o(1), so the limit is f''(0). Therefore, even though f is only given to be twice differentiable at 0, the existence of f''(0) is sufficient for the expansion up to the second order term. Therefore, the initial approach is valid.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the definition of the second derivative directly. Let's write:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But how to relate this to the given limit. Let's see. Let's consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the first derivative:

f(h) = f(0) + ∫₀ʰ f'(t) dt

f(-h) = f(0) + ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt

Therefore,

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = ∫₀ʰ f'(t) dt + ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt

= ∫₀ʰ f'(t) dt - ∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt

Let me make a substitution in the second integral. Let u = -t, so when t = -h, u = h; when t = 0, u = 0. Then,

∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt = ∫₀^h f'(-u) (-du) = -∫₀^h f'(-u) du

Therefore,

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = ∫₀ʰ f'(t) dt + ∫₀^h f'(-u) du

= ∫₀ʰ [f'(t) + f'(-t)] dt

But I don't see an immediate way to connect this to f''(0). However, if we can express the average of f'(t) and f'(-t) in terms of f''(0). Let's see.

Suppose t is approaching 0. Then, f'(t) can be expanded around t = 0:

f'(t) = f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t)

Similarly, f'(-t) = f'(0) - f''(0)t + o(t)

Adding these:

f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2f'(0) + o(t)

Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫₀ʰ [2f'(0) + o(t)] dt = 2f'(0)h + ∫₀ʰ o(t) dt

But ∫₀ʰ o(t) dt is o(h²), since o(t) is a function that goes to zero faster than t, so the integral is o(h²). Therefore,

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = 2f'(0)h + o(h²)

Wait, but this contradicts the earlier result where it was f''(0)h² + o(h²). So which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

If f'(t) = f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t), then f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2f'(0) + f''(0)t - f''(0)t + o(t) + o(t) = 2f'(0) + o(t). Therefore, integrating from 0 to h:

∫₀ʰ [2f'(0) + o(t)] dt = 2f'(0)h + ∫₀ʰ o(t) dt

But ∫₀ʰ o(t) dt is o(h²), since o(t) ≤ C |t| for some C and for t near 0, so ∫₀ʰ o(t) dt ≤ ∫₀ʰ C |t| dt = C h² / 2, which is o(h²). Therefore, the integral is 2f'(0)h + o(h²). Therefore, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = 2f'(0)h + o(h²). Dividing by h² gives 2f'(0)/h + o(1), which would go to infinity unless f'(0) is zero. But this contradicts the previous result. Therefore, there must be an error in this approach.

Wait, this suggests that my initial Taylor expansion approach was correct, and this alternative method is missing something. Let me see where I went wrong. 

Ah, perhaps the error is that I assumed f'(t) can be expanded as f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t), but this is only valid if f''(0) exists. However, even if f''(0) exists, the expansion up to o(t) might not capture the necessary terms for the integral. Wait, but in reality, if f''(0) exists, then f'(t) can be expressed as f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t). Therefore, the sum f'(t) + f'(-t) is 2f'(0) + o(t). Therefore, integrating gives 2f'(0)h + o(h²). However, this contradicts the earlier result where the numerator was f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, there must be a mistake in one of the approaches.

Wait, let's check with a concrete example. Let f(x) = x². Then f''(0) = 2. Let's compute the given limit:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [h² - 0 + h²] / h² = 2h² / h² = 2, which is f''(0). So that works.

Now, using the first approach (Taylor expansion), we get the correct result. However, using the integral approach, we get 2f'(0)h / h² = 2*0*h / h² = 0, which is wrong. Therefore, there must be an error in the integral approach.

Ah, so where's the mistake? Let's see. When I expanded f'(t) and f'(-t), I assumed that f'(t) = f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t). However, this expansion is valid for t approaching 0, but in the integral from 0 to h, t is in the interval [0, h]. If h approaches 0, then t is also approaching 0, so the expansion is valid. Therefore, integrating 2f'(0) + o(t) over [0, h] should give 2f'(0)h + o(h²). But in reality, for f(x) = x², this would give 2*0*h + o(h²) = o(h²), but in reality, the integral is 2h². Therefore, this suggests that the expansion is not capturing the second derivative term. Therefore, the mistake must be in the assumption that f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2f'(0) + o(t). Wait, but for f(x) = x², f'(t) = 2t, so f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2t + (-2t) = 0, but according to the expansion, it should be 2f'(0) + o(t) = 0 + o(t). However, in reality, it's identically zero for t ≠ 0. So the expansion f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2f'(0) + o(t) is correct here, but in this case, f'(0) = 0, so the expansion gives 0 + o(t), which matches the actual value 0. But when we integrate, we get 0 + o(h²), but the actual integral is 0. However, in the example, the numerator is 2h², which is not captured by this approach. Therefore, this suggests that the integral approach is missing something.

Therefore, my initial Taylor expansion approach is correct, and the integral approach must be missing higher-order terms. Therefore, the correct method is to use the Taylor expansion, as the existence of f''(0) allows us to write the second-order term, and the higher-order terms are absorbed into the o(h²). Therefore, the limit is indeed f''(0).

Another way to think about this is to use the definition of the second derivative. Let's write:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But how can we relate this to the given limit? Let's try to express the given limit in terms of f'(h) and f'(-h).

Let me consider the difference quotient for the second derivative:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me write f(h) - f(0) = ∫₀ʰ f'(t) dt, and similarly f(-h) - f(0) = ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt = -∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt

Therefore,

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = ∫₀ʰ f'(t) dt - ∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt

Let me change variables in the second integral. Let u = -t, so:

∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt = ∫₀^h f'(-u) (-du) = -∫₀^h f'(-u) du

Therefore,

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = ∫₀ʰ f'(t) dt + ∫₀^h f'(-u) du

= ∫₀ʰ [f'(t) + f'(-t)] dt

So, the numerator is the integral of [f'(t) + f'(-t)] from 0 to h.

To evaluate this integral, perhaps we can expand f'(t) and f'(-t) around t = 0. Since f''(0) exists, we can write:

f'(t) = f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t)

f'(-t) = f'(0) - f''(0)t + o(t)

Adding these:

f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2f'(0) + o(t)

Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫₀ʰ [2f'(0) + o(t)] dt = 2f'(0)h + ∫₀ʰ o(t) dt

As before, ∫₀ʰ o(t) dt is o(h²), so:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = 2f'(0)h + o(h²)

Dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = 2f'(0)/h + o(1)

But as h approaches 0, this expression would go to infinity unless f'(0) = 0. However, this contradicts our earlier example where f(x) = x², which has f'(0) = 0 and the limit is 2. Therefore, this suggests that the integral approach is missing the second derivative term. 

But wait, in the example where f(x) = x², f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2t + (-2t) = 0, which is indeed 2f'(0) + o(t) = 2*0 + o(t) = o(t). Therefore, ∫₀ʰ [f'(t) + f'(-t)] dt = ∫₀ʰ o(t) dt = o(h²). Therefore, the numerator is o(h²), which when divided by h² gives o(1), so the limit would be 0. But in reality, the limit is 2. Therefore, this approach is flawed.

This inconsistency suggests that the integral approach is not capturing the necessary terms. Therefore, the correct method is the Taylor expansion approach, which correctly captures the second derivative term.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the limit is f''(0), as shown by expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the Taylor series up to the second order, which cancels out the first derivative terms and leaves the second derivative term, which is then divided by h² and taken to the limit as h approaches 0.

Another way to verify this is to use the definition of the second derivative directly. Let's write:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But we need to relate this to the given limit. Let's consider the expression:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me write this as:

[ (f(h) - f(0)) - (f(0) - f(-h)) ] / h²

Let me denote A = f(h) - f(0) and B = f(0) - f(-h). Then, the numerator is A - B.

Using the mean value theorem for A and B:

A = f(h) - f(0) = f'(c₁)h for some c₁ in (0, h)
B = f(0) - f(-h) = f'(c₂)h for some c₂ in (-h, 0)

Therefore, A - B = f'(c₁)h - f'(c₂)h = h(f'(c₁) - f'(c₂))

Dividing by h²:

(A - B)/h² = (f'(c₁) - f'(c₂))/h

But as h approaches 0, c₁ and c₂ also approach 0. Therefore, we can write:

lim_{h→0} [f'(c₁) - f'(0) + f'(0) - f'(c₂)] / h = lim_{h→0} [ (f'(c₁) - f'(0))/c₁ * c₁ + (f'(0) - f'(c₂))/(-c₂) * (-c₂) ] / h

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, since c₁ and c₂ are between 0 and h (or -h and 0), as h approaches 0, c₁ and c₂ approach 0. Therefore, we can approximate f'(c₁) ≈ f'(0) + f''(0)c₁ and f'(c₂) ≈ f'(0) + f''(0)c₂. Then:

f'(c₁) - f'(c₂) ≈ [f'(0) + f''(0)c₁] - [f'(0) + f''(0)c₂] = f''(0)(c₁ - c₂)

Therefore, (A - B)/h² ≈ f''(0)(c₁ - c₂)/h

But c₁ and c₂ are between 0 and h (or -h and 0), so c₁ - c₂ is approximately h - (-h) = 2h, but this is not precise. Alternatively, perhaps this approach is not straightforward.

Alternatively, let's consider writing the given limit as:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = lim_{h→0} [ (f(h) - f(0))/h - (f(0) - f(-h))/h ] / h

This is:

lim_{h→0} [ (f(h) - f(0))/h - (f(0) - f(-h))/h ] / h = lim_{h→0} [ f'(c₁) - f'(c₂) ] / h

where c₁ ∈ (0, h) and c₂ ∈ (-h, 0). As h approaches 0, c₁ and c₂ approach 0. Therefore, we can write:

f'(c₁) - f'(c₂) = [f'(c₁) - f'(0)] + [f'(0) - f'(c₂)]

Then, divide by h:

[ [f'(c₁) - f'(0)] / c₁ * c₁ + [f'(0) - f'(c₂)] / (-c₂) * (-c₂) ] / h

But [f'(c₁) - f'(0)] / c₁ → f''(0) as c₁ → 0, and similarly [f'(0) - f'(c₂)] / (-c₂) → f''(0) as c₂ → 0. Therefore,

[ [f'(c₁) - f'(0)] / c₁ * c₁ + [f'(0) - f'(c₂)] / (-c₂) * (-c₂) ] / h ≈ [f''(0)c₁ + f''(0)c₂] / h

But c₁ and c₂ are both of order h, so c₁ + c₂ is of order h. Therefore, the numerator is f''(0)(c₁ + c₂) ≈ f''(0)(h + (-h)) = 0. This seems to lead to 0, which contradicts the desired result. Therefore, this approach is not working, which suggests that the mean value theorem approach may not be sufficient here.

Therefore, returning to the original method of using the Taylor expansion, which worked for the example and is logically sound, even though the problem only states that f''(0) exists, not that f is twice differentiable in a neighborhood. However, the existence of f''(0) is sufficient to write the second-order expansion at 0, which allows us to compute the limit as f''(0). Therefore, the correct proof is via Taylor expansion.

In summary, the key steps are:
1. Expand f(h) and f(-h) using the second-order Taylor expansion around 0, using the existence of f''(0).
2. Subtract 2f(0) and combine terms.
3. Divide by h² and take the limit as h approaches 0, which cancels the h² terms and leaves f''(0).

This method avoids L'Hospital's rule and directly uses the properties of derivatives and Taylor expansions.

","Okay, so I need to show that if f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). And I can't use L'Hospital's rule. Hmm, let's think. 

First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving f(h) and f(-h), maybe expanding f around 0 using a Taylor series would help. Since f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, that means f is twice differentiable at 0, right? So maybe I can use the Taylor expansion up to the second derivative term.

Let me recall the Taylor series expansion for a function around a point. For f(h) around 0, it would be f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Similarly, for f(-h), it would be f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). 

Wait, let me write that down properly. For f(h):

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

And for f(-h):

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

So if I subtract 2f(0) from both sides and then add f(-h), let's see:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Let me compute each term:

First, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h):

= [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Now, let's combine like terms:

f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) = 0

f'(0)h - f'(0)h = 0

(1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² = f''(0)h²

The o(h²) terms from each expansion: o(h²) + o(h²) = o(h²)

So altogether:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, dividing both sides by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

Now, as h approaches 0, the term o(h²)/h² goes to 0, because o(h²) is a term that goes to zero faster than h². So the limit becomes:

lim_{h->0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + 0 = f''(0)

That seems to do it. But let me check if there are any assumptions I missed. The problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. So the Taylor expansion up to the second derivative is valid here. The o(h²) terms are essential because they capture the higher-order terms that vanish faster than h². Since we are taking the limit as h approaches 0, those terms become negligible. 

Wait, but another way to think about it is using the definition of the second derivative. The second derivative f''(0) is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But here, the given limit is different. However, if I consider the symmetric difference quotient, maybe that's related. Let me see. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the Mean Value Theorem or some expansion. But the Taylor series approach seems straightforward here. Let me verify with another method just to be sure.

Suppose I don't use Taylor. Let's try to express f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) in another way. Maybe using the first-order expansion. Since f is differentiable everywhere (wait, the problem says f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Is f differentiable everywhere, or just at 0? Wait, the problem says f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Hmm, maybe f is differentiable everywhere, but f''(0) exists. So f is twice differentiable at 0. 

But even if f is only differentiable at 0, but f''(0) exists, maybe I need to use the definition of the second derivative. The second derivative at 0 is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But how does this relate to the given limit?

Wait, let's think. If I consider the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². If I let h approach 0, maybe I can express this as a difference quotient for the second derivative. Let's try to manipulate it.

First, note that [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² is the same as [f(h) - f(0) + f(-h) - f(0)] / h². Which is [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h². But that might not be helpful directly.

Alternatively, maybe express f(h) and f(-h) using the first derivative. Since f is differentiable at 0, we can write f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h), and similarly f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h). Then, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h)] = o(h) + o(h) = o(h). But then dividing by h² would give o(h)/h², which tends to 0. But that's not correct, because we know the limit is f''(0). So clearly, using only the first derivative's expansion isn't enough. Therefore, we need to consider the second derivative term.

Ah, right. So the problem states that f''(0) exists, which means the second derivative at 0 exists. Therefore, the function has a second derivative at 0, so the expansion up to the second term is valid. Therefore, the Taylor expansion approach is the right way here.

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of the second derivative as the limit of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. Let's see. If I can relate the given limit to that.

First, note that [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) around 0 using the first derivative and then see if the second derivative comes into play.

But if I use the first-order expansion, f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h), similarly f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h). Then, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h)] = o(h) + o(h) = o(h). Then, dividing by h² gives o(h)/h², which tends to 0. But that contradicts the given result. Therefore, the first-order expansion is insufficient. Therefore, we need to include the second derivative term.

Therefore, the Taylor expansion up to the second term is necessary. Therefore, the initial approach is correct.

But just to ensure that there's no mistake in assuming the Taylor series. Since f''(0) exists, the function is twice differentiable at 0, which allows the expansion up to the second term with the remainder term o(h²). Therefore, even if f is only differentiable at 0, but the second derivative exists, the expansion is valid. Wait, actually, the existence of f''(0) implies that f is differentiable in a neighborhood around 0, right? Because the second derivative is defined as the derivative of the first derivative, so f' must exist in a neighborhood around 0. Therefore, the function f is twice differentiable at 0, so the Taylor expansion up to the second term is valid. Therefore, the approach is correct.

Alternatively, let's try to compute the limit step by step without using Taylor. Let's consider the expression:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me denote this as L. Let's try to compute L.

First, note that the expression is symmetric in h and -h. So maybe consider writing f(h) - f(0) and f(-h) - f(0), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, use the Mean Value Theorem.

Alternatively, express f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) as [f(h) - f(0)] - [f(0) - f(-h)]. So, it's the difference between two differences. Let me try that.

Let me write:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = [f(h) - f(0)] - [f(0) - f(-h)]

Therefore, the expression becomes:

[[f(h) - f(0)] - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h²

But not sure if that helps. Let's denote D(h) = [f(h) - f(0)] / h and D(-h) = [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h). Then, [f(h) - f(0)] = D(h) h and [f(-h) - f(0)] = -D(-h) h.

Therefore, substituting:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = D(h) h - (-D(-h) h) = D(h) h + D(-h) h

Therefore, the expression becomes:

[D(h) h + D(-h) h] / h² = [D(h) + D(-h)] / h

But D(h) is [f(h) - f(0)] / h, which is the difference quotient for f'(0). Similarly, D(-h) is [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h) = [f(0) - f(-h)] / h, which is also the difference quotient for f'(0). Therefore, D(h) + D(-h) = [f(h) - f(0)] / h + [f(0) - f(-h)] / h = [f(h) - f(-h)] / h.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation here. Let's check again.

If D(h) = [f(h) - f(0)] / h and D(-h) = [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h) = [f(0) - f(-h)] / h.

Then, D(h) + D(-h) = [f(h) - f(0)] / h + [f(0) - f(-h)] / h = [f(h) - f(-h)] / h.

Therefore, the expression becomes [f(h) - f(-h)] / h³. Wait, no, because:

Original expression after substitution was [D(h) h + D(-h) h] / h² = [D(h) + D(-h)] / h = [ [f(h) - f(0)] / h + [f(0) - f(-h)] / h ] / h = [f(h) - f(-h)] / h².

Wait, that's getting confusing. Let me retrace:

Starting with:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f(h) - f(0) - (f(0) - f(-h))] / h²

= [ (f(h) - f(0)) - (f(0) - f(-h)) ] / h²

= [ (f(h) - f(0)) / h - (f(0) - f(-h)) / h ] / h

= [ D(h) - D(-h) ] / h

But D(h) is the difference quotient for f'(0), and D(-h) is another difference quotient for f'(0). So, D(h) - D(-h) = [f(h) - f(0)] / h - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h = [f(h) - f(-h)] / h.

Therefore, [D(h) - D(-h)] / h = [f(h) - f(-h)] / h².

Hmm, so now we have the expression [f(h) - f(-h)] / h². Is there a way to relate this to the second derivative? Let's think. The average rate of change of f'(h) between h and -h. Wait, the second derivative is the derivative of the first derivative. So, maybe using the Mean Value Theorem for derivatives.

By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a point c between -h and h such that f'(c) = [f(h) - f(-h)] / (2h). But not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, consider expanding f'(h) and f'(-h) around 0.

Since f''(0) exists, f' is differentiable at 0, so f'(h) = f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h), and f'(-h) = f'(0) - f''(0)h + o(h). Therefore, f'(h) - f'(-h) = 2f''(0)h + o(h). Then, [f'(h) - f'(-h)] / (2h) = f''(0) + o(h)/h, which tends to f''(0) as h approaches 0.

But how does this relate to [f(h) - f(-h)] / h²? Let me see. If I integrate f'(t) from -h to h, I get f(h) - f(-h). So, f(h) - f(-h) = ∫_{-h}^h f'(t) dt. Then, [f(h) - f(-h)] / h² = (1/h²) ∫_{-h}^h f'(t) dt.

Let me compute that integral. Let's make substitution: let u = t + h, but maybe better to split the integral. Alternatively, note that ∫_{-h}^h f'(t) dt = 2 ∫_0^h f'(t) dt, because the function is symmetric. Wait, no, unless f is even, which we don't know. Wait, but the integral from -h to h is equal to ∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt + ∫_0^h f'(t) dt. Let me substitute t = -s in the first integral:

∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt = ∫_{h}^0 f'(-s)(-ds) = ∫_0^h f'(-s) ds.

Therefore, the total integral is ∫_0^h f'(t) dt + ∫_0^h f'(-s) ds = ∫_0^h [f'(t) + f'(-t)] dt.

So, [f(h) - f(-h)] / h² = (1/h²) ∫_0^h [f'(t) + f'(-t)] dt.

Now, let's evaluate the integral. Since f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2f'(0) + o(1) as t approaches 0, because f' is differentiable at 0, so f'(t) = f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t), and similarly f'(-t) = f'(0) - f''(0)t + o(t). Therefore, f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2f'(0) + o(t). Therefore, substituting into the integral:

∫_0^h [2f'(0) + o(t)] dt = 2f'(0)h + ∫_0^h o(t) dt.

The integral of o(t) from 0 to h is o(h²), because o(t) is a function that goes to zero faster than t as t approaches 0. Therefore, the total integral is 2f'(0)h + o(h²). Therefore,

[f(h) - f(-h)] / h² = (2f'(0)h + o(h²)) / h² = 2f'(0)/h + o(h²)/h².

But wait, as h approaches 0, the term 2f'(0)/h would go to infinity unless f'(0) is zero. But this contradicts the previous result where the limit was f''(0). Therefore, this approach must be wrong. Hmm, where did I go wrong?

Wait, maybe the assumption that f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2f'(0) + o(1) is incorrect. Let's check again.

Given that f''(0) exists, f' is differentiable at 0. Therefore, f'(t) = f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t). Similarly, f'(-t) = f'(0) - f''(0)t + o(t). Therefore, adding them together:

f'(t) + f'(-t) = 2f'(0) + o(t) + o(t) = 2f'(0) + o(t).

Therefore, the integral ∫_0^h [2f'(0) + o(t)] dt = 2f'(0)h + ∫_0^h o(t) dt.

But the integral of o(t) from 0 to h is o(h²), as o(t) is a function that for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that |o(t)| < ε|t| for |t| < δ. Therefore, ∫_0^h o(t) dt ≤ ∫_0^h ε t dt = ε h² / 2. Therefore, ∫_0^h o(t) dt = o(h²). Therefore, the total integral is 2f'(0)h + o(h²). Therefore,

[f(h) - f(-h)] / h² = [2f'(0)h + o(h²)] / h² = 2f'(0)/h + o(h²)/h².

But as h approaches 0, 2f'(0)/h would go to infinity unless f'(0) is zero. However, the original problem states that the limit is f''(0). Therefore, there must be a mistake in this approach.

Wait, but earlier the Taylor series approach worked. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the substitution step. Let's see. The integral from -h to h of f'(t) dt is indeed equal to the integral from 0 to h of [f'(t) + f'(-t)] dt, which is correct. But then why is there a conflict with the Taylor series approach?

Wait, in the Taylor series approach, we had [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h². But according to the integral approach, [f(h) - f(-h)] / h² = 2f'(0)/h + o(h). But how can that be?

Wait, there must be a miscalculation in the integral approach. Let me check again. The original expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Wait, in the integral approach, we considered [f(h) - f(-h)] / h², but actually, the original expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f(h) - f(0) + f(-h) - f(0)] / h². So, it's [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h². Which is different from [f(h) - f(-h)] / h².

Wait, so earlier when I tried to compute [f(h) - f(-h)] / h², that's not the same as the original expression. The original expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h², which is equal to [f(h) - f(0) + f(-h) - f(0)] / h², which is [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h².

But when I considered the integral, I ended up with [f(h) - f(-h)] / h², which is different. Therefore, that approach might not be the right path.

Let me try another approach. Let's use the definition of the second derivative. The second derivative f''(0) is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But how can we relate this to the given limit?

Alternatively, consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the first derivative and then using the definition of the second derivative.

Let me write f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²), and similarly f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Then, adding them:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h², which tends to f''(0) as h approaches 0. So this is the same as the Taylor series approach, which worked.

Therefore, perhaps the integral approach was leading me astray because I was considering a different expression. So the correct way is the Taylor expansion.

But let me check once more. Suppose I don't use Taylor. Let's use the definition of the second derivative. Let's consider:

The limit we need is lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h².

Let me denote this limit as L. Let's try to express this in terms of f'(h) and f'(-h).

First, note that f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) by the first-order Taylor expansion (since f is differentiable at 0, and if f''(0) exists, we can take the second term). Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) = -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, adding these two:

[f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)] = -2f'(0)h + f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = -2f'(0)h + f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = -2f'(0)/h + f''(0) + o(h²)/h².

Wait, but this suggests that the limit depends on f'(0)/h, which would go to infinity unless f'(0) = 0. But this contradicts the original problem statement. Therefore, there must be a mistake here.

Wait, this is confusing. Wait, in the previous steps, when I expanded f(h) - f(0) and f(-h) - f(0) using the first-order Taylor expansion (including the second derivative term), I get:

f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) - f(0) = -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Adding these:

f(h) - f(0) + f(-h) - f(0) = -2f'(0)h + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = -2f'(0)h + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Then, dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = -2f'(0)/h + f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

But as h approaches 0, -2f'(0)/h would go to -∞ or +∞ depending on the sign of f'(0), unless f'(0) = 0. However, the problem states that the limit is f''(0). Therefore, this suggests that the above approach is missing something. Wait, but in the Taylor expansion, when we include the second derivative term, shouldn't the -2f'(0)/h term cancel out? But in the previous correct approach, when I expanded both f(h) and f(-h) to the second order and added them, the linear terms canceled out, leaving the quadratic term. Wait, let me check that again.

Wait, no. Wait, in the correct Taylor expansion approach, we had:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, adding them:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

Which gives the correct limit. But in the previous step where I split into f(h) - f(0) and f(-h) - f(0), I ended up with an extra -2f'(0)/h term. What's the difference?

Ah, I see. The difference is whether I assume the expansion includes the second derivative term. If I only use the first-order expansion (up to f'(0)h), then:

f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + o(h)

f(-h) - f(0) = -f'(0)h + o(h)

Adding them:

f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = o(h) + o(h) = o(h)

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = o(h)/h² = o(1/h), which tends to 0. But that's not correct. Therefore, we must include the second derivative term in the expansion. Therefore, the correct approach is to expand to the second order, which cancels the linear terms and leaves the quadratic term.

Therefore, the key is that since f''(0) exists, we can include the second term in the expansion, allowing us to capture the f''(0)h² term. Therefore, the initial Taylor expansion approach is correct.

But then why did the other approach give a conflicting result? Because in that case, I incorrectly split the expression and ended up with a term that depends on h in the denominator, which isn't accounted for in the correct approach. Therefore, the correct method is the Taylor expansion, which properly cancels the linear terms and isolates the quadratic term involving f''(0).

Therefore, the conclusion is that the limit is indeed f''(0), as required.

Another way to think about it is to use the definition of the second derivative as the limit of the symmetric difference quotient. The expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² is exactly the symmetric difference quotient for the second derivative. In numerical analysis, the second derivative can be approximated by this expression, and as h approaches 0, it converges to f''(0). Therefore, the limit is f''(0).

To summarize, using the Taylor expansion up to the second derivative term allows us to cancel the linear terms involving f'(0)h and isolate the quadratic term involving f''(0)h², leading directly to the desired limit. This avoids the need for L'Hospital's rule and relies on the existence of the second derivative at 0.

","Okay, so I need to show that if f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving derivatives, Taylor series expansions might be useful. Since f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, that means f is twice differentiable at 0, right? So maybe expanding f(h) and f(-h) around 0 using Taylor's theorem would help here. 

Let me recall Taylor's theorem. For a function that's twice differentiable at a point, the expansion up to the second order is f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + (1/2)f''(a)(x - a)^2 + o((x - a)^2). In this case, a is 0, so it simplifies to f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + (1/2)f''(0)x^2 + o(x^2). 

So, applying this to f(h) and f(-h), let's write those out. 

For f(h), substituting x = h, we get:
f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2).

Similarly, for f(-h), substituting x = -h:
f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)^2 + o((-h)^2).

Simplifying that, since (-h)^2 is h^2, and o((-h)^2) is the same as o(h^2), because the remainder term depends on the order of h. So f(-h) becomes:
f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2).

Now, let's compute f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h). Let's substitute the expansions:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)].

Let me compute term by term:

First term: f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)
Second term: -2f(0)
Third term: + f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)

Adding them together:

f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) cancels out to 0.

f'(0)h - f'(0)h cancels out to 0.

Then, (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 = f''(0)h^2.

And the o(h^2) terms add up to o(h^2).

So overall, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2).

Now, the original limit is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h^2. Substituting the above result:

[f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)] / h^2 = f''(0) + o(h^2)/h^2.

We know that o(h^2)/h^2 approaches 0 as h approaches 0 because the remainder term o(h^2) is bounded by C|h|^2 for some constant C, so dividing by h^2 gives something that goes to 0. Therefore, the limit becomes f''(0) as h approaches 0.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check if there are any missing steps or assumptions. The problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. So we are assuming that f''(0) exists, which is necessary for the Taylor expansion up to the second order. Also, by differentiability, the first derivative exists, which is required for the expansion. 

Is there another way to approach this without using Taylor series? Maybe using the definition of the derivative or the mean value theorem? Let me try that method as a cross-check.

Another approach: Let's consider the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h^2. Let me denote this limit as L. Maybe manipulate the expression to express it in terms of derivatives.

First, note that [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h^2 can be rewritten as [f(h) - f(0)] / h^2 - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h^2. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express it as [f(h) - f(0)] / h^2 + [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h)^2. Wait, that might not be correct. Let me see:

Wait, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h^2 = [f(h) - f(0)] / h^2 + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h^2. But f(-h) - f(0) over h^2 is the same as [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h)^2 multiplied by (-1)^2, which is 1. Wait, no. Let me check:

If I let k = -h, then as h approaches 0, k approaches 0 as well. Then [f(-h) - f(0)] / h^2 = [f(k) - f(0)] / (-k)^2 = [f(k) - f(0)] / k^2. So, indeed, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h^2 = [f(h) - f(0)] / h^2 + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h^2 = [f(h) - f(0)] / h^2 + [f(k) - f(0)] / k^2 where k = -h. Therefore, as h approaches 0, both terms approach [f'(0)]^2? Wait, no. Wait, [f(h) - f(0)] / h approaches f'(0), so [f(h) - f(0)] / h^2 is [f'(0) + o(1)] / h, which would go to infinity unless f'(0) is zero. But this seems problematic. Therefore, maybe this approach isn't the right way.

Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the definition of the second derivative. Since f''(0) exists, it's the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h, and similarly from the left as well. But I need to connect that to the given expression.

Wait, perhaps express the given limit in terms of the second derivative. Let me recall that the second derivative at 0 can be written as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. Similarly, since the function is differentiable on both sides, we can also consider the limit from the left. But how does that relate to the given expression?

Alternatively, note that the numerator f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) resembles the central difference formula for the second derivative. The standard central difference formula is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h^2, which is indeed a way to approximate f''(0). Therefore, if f''(0) exists, then this limit should equal f''(0). But to prove this without using Taylor series, maybe use the definition of the derivative.

Wait, but the problem says not to use L'Hospital's rule. So perhaps the Taylor expansion is acceptable here, as long as we don't use L'Hospital. But in the first approach, using Taylor series seems straightforward. Let me verify again.

If f is twice differentiable at 0, then its Taylor expansion up to the second order is as I wrote before. Then substituting h and -h gives the expressions for f(h) and f(-h). Then combining them, the terms involving f(0) and f'(0) cancel out, leaving a term with f''(0)h^2 and the remainder. Then dividing by h^2 gives f''(0) plus a term that goes to zero. Therefore, the limit is f''(0). That seems correct.

But maybe there's a way to do this without assuming the Taylor expansion. Let's try another method. Suppose we use the definition of the second derivative. Since f''(0) exists, it is equal to the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. Also, since f is differentiable, f'(0) exists. Let's denote f'(0) = a.

So, f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - a]/h.

Our target is to show that lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h^2 = a.

Let me see if I can express [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] in terms of f'(h) and f'(-h). Maybe using the mean value theorem for each term.

For the term f(h) - f(0), by the mean value theorem, there exists a point c_h between 0 and h such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c_h) * h. Similarly, for f(-h) - f(0), there exists a point d_h between -h and 0 such that f(-h) - f(0) = f'(d_h) * (-h).

Therefore, f(h) - f(0) = f'(c_h) * h, so f(h) = f(0) + f'(c_h) * h. Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) + f'(d_h) * (-h).

Now, substituting these into the numerator:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(c_h)h] - 2f(0) + [f(0) + f'(d_h)(-h)].

Simplifying:

f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) cancels out.

f'(c_h)h - f'(d_h)h = h[f'(c_h) - f'(d_h)].

Therefore, the numerator is h[f'(c_h) - f'(d_h)].

So the expression becomes [h(f'(c_h) - f'(d_h))]/h^2 = [f'(c_h) - f'(d_h)] / h.

Now, we need to evaluate the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(c_h) - f'(d_h)] / h.

But c_h is between 0 and h, so as h approaches 0, c_h approaches 0. Similarly, d_h is between -h and 0, so as h approaches 0, d_h approaches 0 as well.

Therefore, f'(c_h) approaches f'(0) = a, and f'(d_h) also approaches f'(0) = a. So the numerator [f'(c_h) - f'(d_h)] approaches 0, and the denominator h approaches 0. So we have a 0/0 indeterminate form. But we can't use L'Hospital's rule, so how to proceed?

Wait, but perhaps we can use the fact that f''(0) exists. Let me recall that f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. So, as h approaches 0, [f'(h) - a]/h approaches f''(0).

Similarly, for the term [f'(c_h) - a]/c_h approaches f''(0) as c_h approaches 0. Similarly, [f'(d_h) - a]/d_h approaches f''(0) as d_h approaches 0.

But in our current expression, we have [f'(c_h) - f'(d_h)] / h. Let's try to rewrite this:

[f'(c_h) - a + a - f'(d_h)] / h = [f'(c_h) - a]/h + [a - f'(d_h)]/h.

But note that c_h is positive, approaching 0 from the right, and d_h is negative, approaching 0 from the left. So, [f'(c_h) - a]/h is similar to [f'(h) - a]/h as h approaches 0 from the right, which tends to f''(0). Similarly, [a - f'(d_h)]/h is [a - f'(d_h)]/h. Let me make a substitution here: let h' = -d_h. Since d_h is approaching 0 from the left, h' approaches 0 from the right. So [a - f'(d_h)]/h = [f'(h') - a]/(-h') = -[f'(h') - a]/h'. As h' approaches 0 from the right, this tends to -f''(0).

Therefore, combining the two terms:

[f'(c_h) - a]/h + [a - f'(d_h)]/h = [f'(c_h) - a]/h - [f'(h') - a]/h' where h' = -d_h.

As h approaches 0, both [f'(c_h) - a]/h and -[f'(h') - a]/h' approach f''(0) - f''(0) = 0? Wait, no:

Wait, [f'(c_h) - a]/h approaches f''(0) as h approaches 0 from the right, and -[f'(h') - a]/h' approaches -f''(0) as h' approaches 0 from the right. So adding them gives f''(0) - f''(0) = 0. But that would mean the limit is 0, which contradicts our initial goal. Wait, this can't be right. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, let's check again. Let me denote:

Let’s let’s consider the two terms:

Term1 = [f'(c_h) - a]/h

Term2 = [a - f'(d_h)]/h = -[f'(d_h) - a]/h

But d_h = -k_h where k_h approaches 0 from the right as h approaches 0 from the right. So Term2 = -[f'(-k_h) - a]/h. But h = -k_h, so Term2 = -[f'(-k_h) - a]/(-k_h) = [f'(-k_h) - a]/k_h. As k_h approaches 0 from the right, [f'(-k_h) - a]/k_h is the same as the limit from the left of [f'(t) - a]/t as t approaches 0. Since f''(0) exists, this limit should also be f''(0). Therefore, Term2 = [f'(-k_h) - a]/k_h approaches f''(0) as k_h approaches 0. Therefore, Term1 + Term2 = [f'(c_h) - a]/h + [f'(d_h) - a]/(-h). Wait, no, Term2 is [f'(-k_h) - a]/k_h, which is [f'(d_h) - a]/h since d_h = -k_h and h = k_h? Wait, no, h is going to 0, and k_h is a different variable.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me clarify:

Let’s denote for h approaching 0 from the right:

c_h ∈ (0, h)

d_h ∈ (-h, 0)

So, Term1 = [f'(c_h) - a]/h, and Term2 = [a - f'(d_h)]/h = [f'(d_h) - a]/(-h). Let's let d_h = -k_h where k_h ∈ (0, h). Then Term2 = [f'(-k_h) - a]/(-h) = [f'(-k_h) - a]/(-k_h) * (k_h / h). As h approaches 0, k_h also approaches 0. Now, [f'(-k_h) - a]/(-k_h) is the derivative from the left, which is f''(0) because the derivative exists. However, the term k_h / h is (k_h / h). But k_h is in (0, h), so k_h / h is between 0 and 1. However, unless we know more about the relationship between k_h and h, we can't directly say what k_h / h approaches. But perhaps we can bound it.

Wait, but if we use the Mean Value Theorem for f' on the interval [-k_h, 0], then there exists some point m_h ∈ (-k_h, 0) such that [f'(-k_h) - f'(0)] / (-k_h - 0) = f''(m_h). Similarly, [f'(c_h) - f'(0)] / (c_h - 0) = f''(n_h) for some n_h ∈ (0, c_h).

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps use the definition of f''(0):

Since f''(0) exists, for any ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all |h| < δ, |[f'(h) - a]/h - f''(0)| < ε. Similarly for h approaching from the left.

But c_h is approaching 0 from the right, so |[f'(c_h) - a]/c_h - f''(0)| < ε. Similarly, for d_h approaching 0 from the left, |[f'(d_h) - a]/d_h - f''(0)| < ε.

But in our terms, Term1 = [f'(c_h) - a]/h = [f'(c_h) - a]/c_h * (c_h / h). Similarly, Term2 = [f'(d_h) - a]/d_h * (d_h / h).

But c_h / h is between 0 and 1, and d_h / h is between -1 and 0. However, as h approaches 0, c_h is O(h) and d_h is O(h), so c_h / h and d_h / h are bounded. For example, since c_h ∈ (0, h), c_h / h ∈ (0, 1). Similarly, d_h ∈ (-h, 0), so d_h / h ∈ (-1, 0). Therefore, |Term1| = |[f'(c_h) - a]/c_h| * |c_h / h| ≤ |f''(0) + ε| * 1, and similarly |Term2| = |[f'(d_h) - a]/d_h| * |d_h / h| ≤ |f''(0) + ε| * 1. Therefore, Term1 + Term2 is approximately f''(0) * (c_h / h) + f''(0) * (d_h / h). But c_h / h + d_h / h = (c_h + d_h)/h. However, since c_h is between 0 and h, and d_h is between -h and 0, c_h + d_h is between -h and h. Therefore, (c_h + d_h)/h is between -1 and 1. But this seems not directly helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps note that as h approaches 0, c_h and d_h both approach 0, so [f'(c_h) - a]/h = [f'(c_h) - a]/c_h * (c_h / h). The first factor [f'(c_h) - a]/c_h approaches f''(0), and c_h / h approaches 1 because c_h ~ h. Similarly, [f'(d_h) - a]/d_h approaches f''(0), and d_h / h approaches 1 because d_h ~ h. But since d_h is negative, d_h / h approaches -1. Wait, so Term1 = [f'(c_h) - a]/h ≈ f''(0) * 1, and Term2 = [f'(d_h) - a]/d_h * (d_h / h) ≈ f''(0) * (-1). Therefore, Term1 + Term2 ≈ f''(0) - f''(0) = 0. But this contradicts our initial goal. Therefore, this approach must be flawed.

Wait, no. Actually, Term1 is [f'(c_h) - a]/h, which is [f'(c_h) - a]/c_h * (c_h / h). If c_h is proportional to h, say c_h = kh for some k ∈ (0,1), then [f'(c_h) - a]/c_h ≈ f''(0), and c_h / h = k. So Term1 ≈ f''(0) * k. Similarly, Term2 = [f'(d_h) - a]/d_h * (d_h / h). If d_h = -kh for some k ∈ (0,1), then [f'(d_h) - a]/d_h ≈ f''(0), and d_h / h = -k. So Term2 ≈ f''(0) * (-k). Therefore, Term1 + Term2 ≈ f''(0)k - f''(0)k = 0. But this suggests the limit is 0, which is wrong. So clearly, this approach isn't working. Maybe the Mean Value Theorem approach isn't the right way here.

Alternatively, perhaps express the given limit in terms of the second derivative. Let's consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the definition of differentiability. 

Since f is differentiable at 0, we can write:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h),

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h).

But we also know that f''(0) exists, so f'(h) = f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Therefore, integrating f'(h), maybe? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, since f''(0) exists, the second derivative is the limit of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. So f'(h) = f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Then, integrating from 0 to h, we get f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2). Which is the Taylor expansion. So even if we try to avoid Taylor series, we end up needing the second derivative term. Therefore, maybe the only way to do this without L'Hospital is to use the Taylor expansion. 

Given that, the first method using Taylor series seems valid. Let me recap that:

Expand f(h) and f(-h) around 0 up to the second order:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)

Subtract 2f(0) and add:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)

Divide by h^2:

[f''(0)h^2 + o(h^2)] / h^2 = f''(0) + o(h^2)/h^2

As h approaches 0, o(h^2)/h^2 approaches 0, so the limit is f''(0). 

This seems correct and doesn't use L'Hospital's rule. The key assumption is that f is twice differentiable at 0, which allows the Taylor expansion up to the second order. The problem statement does mention that f''(0) exists, so this is acceptable. Therefore, this proof should be valid.

Another way to think about it is by considering the second derivative as the limit of the difference quotient of the first derivative. Since the numerator f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) is essentially the second difference of f at 0, which approximates the second derivative. The denominator h^2 scales it appropriately. However, to make this rigorous without L'Hospital, the Taylor expansion approach is probably the most straightforward.

Therefore, after considering both approaches and verifying that the Taylor series method works without L'Hospital's rule, I can confidently conclude that the given limit equals f''(0).

","Okay, so I need to show that if f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). Hmm, the problem says not to use L'Hospital's rule, so I have to think of another way. Let me start by recalling some calculus concepts.

First, since f is differentiable, its first derivative exists. Also, the second derivative at 0 exists, which is f''(0). The expression in the numerator looks familiar. It's similar to the second difference quotient used in the definition of the second derivative. The standard second derivative definition using the limit is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² as h approaches 0. So maybe this problem is basically just applying the definition of the second derivative. But wait, the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, so maybe there's a need to derive this limit from the basic definitions.

Let me write down the given expression again:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0)

I need to show that this limit equals f''(0). Since f''(0) exists, by definition, the limit of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h as h approaches 0 should exist and equal f''(0). But how does that relate to the given expression?

Alternatively, maybe I can expand f(h) and f(-h) using Taylor series expansions around 0, up to the second order. Since f is twice differentiable at 0, the Taylor expansion would be:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Similarly, for f(-h):

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Here, o(h²) represents terms that go to zero faster than h² as h approaches 0.

Let me substitute these into the numerator:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Simplifying term by term:

f(0) cancels with -2f(0) + f(0), so that's 0.

f'(0)h - f'(0)h cancels out as well, leaving 0.

Then, we have (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, the numerator becomes f''(0)h² + o(h²). Dividing by h² gives:

[f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, o(h²)/h² approaches 0, so the limit is f''(0). That seems straightforward. But wait, the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Does that mean the function is twice differentiable at 0, but maybe not differentiable elsewhere? If so, then the Taylor expansion around 0 should still hold up to the second order because the second derivative exists at 0. Let me confirm that.

The Taylor expansion for a function at a point up to the second order is:

f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + (1/2)f''(a)(x - a)^2 + o((x - a)^2)

In this case, a is 0, so:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Similarly for f(-h). So even if the function is not twice differentiable everywhere, as long as f''(0) exists, the expansion around 0 up to the second order is valid. Therefore, the previous calculation should hold.

But maybe the problem wants me to derive this without using Taylor series? Let me think. If I can't use Taylor series, perhaps I can use the definition of the second derivative as the limit of the first difference quotient's derivative. That is, f''(0) is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. So if I can express the given limit in terms of this.

Alternatively, maybe express f(h) and f(-h) using the first derivative. Let me try that.

From the definition of the derivative, f'(0) = lim_{h→0} [f(h) - f(0)] / h. Similarly, f'(-0) = lim_{h→0} [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h) = lim_{h→0} [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h) = f'(0). So f'(0) is the same from the left and right.

But how to connect this to the second derivative?

Alternatively, consider the difference f(h) - f(-h). Let's see:

f(h) - f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + ...] - [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + ...] = 2f'(0)h + o(h²)

But if I take the difference f(h) - f(-h), then divide by 2h, that gives f'(0) + o(h). But how does that help with the second derivative?

Wait, maybe if I consider the difference quotient of the first derivative. Let me think. The second derivative can be defined as the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. So if I can express the given limit in terms of this.

Alternatively, let's try to express the given expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² in terms of the second derivative.

Let me consider f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) by the Taylor expansion. Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) = -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Then, adding these two equations:

[f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)] = [f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] + [-f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²). Dividing both sides by h² gives [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h². Taking the limit as h approaches 0, the term o(h²)/h² goes to 0, so the limit is f''(0). Therefore, this shows the required result.

But wait, this is exactly the same as the Taylor series approach. So maybe the problem is expecting this method. Since f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, the second-order expansion is valid, so the calculation holds. Therefore, the limit is f''(0).

Alternatively, if we don't use Taylor series, perhaps we can use the definition of the second derivative as the limit of the first difference quotient's difference quotient. Let's try that.

Let me recall that f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h.

But how can I relate this to the given expression?

Let me consider the given expression:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h².

Let me denote this limit as L. I need to show that L = f''(0).

To connect this to the definition of f''(0), perhaps I can express f(h) and f(-h) in terms of their derivatives.

Let me consider the difference f(h) - f(0). By the definition of the derivative, this is f'(0)h + o(h). Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) is -f'(0)h + o(h). Therefore:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h)

Therefore, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h)] = 0 + o(h) + o(h) = o(h)

Wait, that can't be right. If I substitute h = 0.1, then o(h) is something like 0.1 times some function that goes to zero. Let's see, perhaps this approach is missing higher-order terms.

But maybe we need to go to the second-order terms. Since we are dividing by h², we need to have the second-order expansion. So perhaps the expansion should be:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Then, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Simplifying:

= [f(0) - f(0) + f'(0)h - f'(0)h] + [(1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h²] + [o(h²) + o(h²)]

= 0 + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, o(h²)/h² approaches 0, so the limit is f''(0). Therefore, this confirms the result.

But the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Does this mean that the function is twice differentiable only at 0, or is it differentiable in some neighborhood around 0? The problem says ""differentiable and f''(0) exists"", which might imply that f is differentiable everywhere, but f'' exists only at 0. However, for the Taylor expansion up to the second order around 0, the existence of f''(0) is sufficient. The expansion doesn't require differentiability beyond the point, just the existence of the second derivative at that point.

Therefore, even if the function is not twice differentiable elsewhere, as long as f''(0) exists, the expansion up to the second order holds, so the calculation is valid.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a more elementary proof without using Taylor series. Let me try another approach.

Suppose we use the definition of the second derivative as the limit of the first difference quotient's difference quotient. So:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But how to connect this to the given limit.

Let me consider the given expression:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me try to express this in terms of first derivatives. Let's denote the numerator as N(h) = f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h). Let's consider the difference N(h) = [f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)]

We know that [f(h) - f(0)] = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) from the first-order expansion. Similarly, [f(-h) - f(0)] = -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Adding these together gives N(h) = f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, N(h)/h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h², and the limit as h→0 is f''(0). But this again uses Taylor series.

Alternatively, perhaps use the Mean Value Theorem. Let me consider the function g(h) = f(h) - f(-h). Then, g'(h) = f'(h) + f'(-h). But not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, let's use the definition of the second derivative. Let me recall that the second derivative can be written as the limit:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

So if I can relate the given limit to this expression.

Let me consider the given limit:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me try to express this in terms of f'(h) and f'(-h). Let's note that:

f(h) - f(0) = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt

Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) = ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt = -∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt

Therefore, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)] = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt - ∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt

Let me compute these integrals:

∫₀^h f'(t) dt = f(h) - f(0)

∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt = f(0) - f(-h)

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = [f(h) - f(0)] - [f(0) - f(-h)] = [f(h) - f(0)] - [f(0) - f(-h)] = f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)

Wait, this seems circular. Maybe another approach.

Let me split the integral ∫₀^h f'(t) dt into two parts: from 0 to h/2 and from h/2 to h. Similarly for the other integral. Not sure.

Alternatively, consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the definition of the derivative:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Adding these:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Then, subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, dividing by h²:

[f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

Taking the limit as h approaches 0:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0)

Which is exactly the given expression. Therefore, this proves the required result.

But wait, this seems to be the same as the Taylor series approach. Maybe the problem is expecting this method. Since f''(0) exists, the second-order terms in the expansion around 0 are valid, so the result holds.

Alternatively, maybe use the definition of the derivative twice. Let's try that.

First, consider the difference quotient for the second derivative:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But how to relate this to the given limit.

Let me consider the given expression:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me write this as:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - f(0) - (f(0) - f(-h))] / h²

Which is:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - f(0) - ( - (f(-h) - f(0)) ) ] / h²

= lim_{h→0} [f(h) - f(0) + (f(-h) - f(0))] / h²

= lim_{h→0} [ [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h² ]

But [f(h) - f(0)] / h² = [f(h) - f(0)] / h * 1/h, which is the first difference quotient multiplied by 1/h. Similarly for the other term.

But since f is differentiable, [f(h) - f(0)] / h → f'(0) as h→0. Therefore, [f(h) - f(0)] / h² = [f(h) - f(0)] / h * 1/h ≈ f'(0) * (1/h). But this seems problematic because 1/h goes to infinity or negative infinity. However, when we add the two terms:

[f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h² = [f(h) - f(0) + f(-h) - f(0)] / h² = [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h²

But if we write each term as [f(h) - f(0)] / h² = [f(h) - f(0)] / h * 1/h, then:

= [f'(0) + o(1)] * 1/h + [f'(-h) + o(1)] * 1/(-h)

But f'(-h) = f'(0) + o(1) as h→0, since f is differentiable at 0. Therefore:

= [f'(0) + o(1)] * 1/h + [f'(0) + o(1)] * (-1/h)

= [f'(0) + o(1) - f'(0) - o(1)] / h

= [o(1)] / h

But this seems to lead to an indeterminate form, which is not helpful. Therefore, this approach might not work.

Alternatively, maybe consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the definition of derivatives. Let's write:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Adding these two:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Dividing by h²:

[f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

Taking the limit as h approaches 0:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0)

Which is exactly the given expression. Therefore, this confirms the result.

But again, this is the Taylor series approach. Perhaps the problem is designed to have us recognize this expression as the second difference quotient. In numerical analysis, the second central difference quotient is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h², which approximates the second derivative at 0. Therefore, the limit of this expression as h approaches 0 is indeed the second derivative at 0.

Therefore, the key steps are:

1. Expand f(h) and f(-h) using Taylor series up to the second order, noting that f''(0) exists.
2. Combine the expansions to eliminate the first-order terms.
3. Divide by h² and take the limit as h approaches 0.

This method works because the existence of f''(0) ensures that the second-order terms are valid in the expansion. Even if the function is not twice differentiable everywhere, the local behavior around 0 is sufficient for the limit.

Alternatively, another approach could be to use the Mean Value Theorem twice, but I don't see a straightforward way. The Taylor series method seems the most direct here.

Therefore, the final answer is f''(0), as the limit evaluates to the second derivative at 0.

","Okay, so I need to show that if f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared is equal to f''(0). And I can't use L'Hospital's rule. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving derivatives, Taylor series expansions or using the definition of derivatives might be helpful. Since the problem mentions differentiability and the existence of the second derivative at 0, maybe expanding f(h) and f(-h) around 0 using Taylor series would work.

Wait, but the problem says f is differentiable, but f''(0) exists. So f is twice differentiable at 0, even though maybe not everywhere? But for the purpose of this limit, I think we only care about the behavior near 0. Let me recall the Taylor expansion up to the second order. For a function that is twice differentiable at a point a, the expansion is f(a + h) = f(a) + f'(a)h + (1/2)f''(a)h² + o(h²). But here, the expansion is around 0, so a = 0.

So applying that to f(h) and f(-h), we get:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)² + o(h²) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Now, if I plug these into the expression f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h):

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Let me compute term by term:

First term: f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Second term: -2f(0)

Third term: f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Adding them together:

f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) + [f'(0)h - f'(0)h] + [(1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h²] + o(h²) + o(h²)

Simplify each part:

f(0) terms: 1 - 2 + 1 = 0

f'(0)h terms: f'(0)h - f'(0)h = 0

f''(0)h² terms: (1/2 + 1/2)f''(0)h² = f''(0)h²

The little o terms: o(h²) + o(h²) = o(h²)

So overall:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Then, dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, the term o(h²)/h² goes to 0 because o(h²) means something that goes to zero faster than h². Therefore, the limit becomes f''(0).

Wait, but let me verify that step again. The expansion of f(h) and f(-h) includes the remainder terms o(h²). So when we add them, the remainder terms add up to o(h²). Then, when we divide by h², o(h²)/h² is o(1), which tends to 0 as h approaches 0. Therefore, the entire expression tends to f''(0). That seems right.

But the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Does the existence of f''(0) imply that the Taylor expansion up to the second order is valid? I think so, because if the second derivative exists at a point, then the function is twice differentiable there, and the Taylor expansion with remainder holds. So the key step here is using the Taylor expansion around 0, which is valid because f''(0) exists.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this without Taylor series by using the definition of the derivative. Let's see.

Another approach: Since f''(0) exists, f' is differentiable at 0. So f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But how does that help here?

Wait, the expression given is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me think of this as [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h². But that might not be helpful. Alternatively, consider the average of [f(h) - f(0)] / h² and [f(-h) - f(0)] / h². Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe express the expression as [f(h) - f(0) - (f(-h) - f(0))]/h². Wait, that would be [f(h) - f(0) - f(-h) + f(0)] / h² = [f(h) - f(-h)] / h². But that's not the same as the original expression. The original is f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) over h². So perhaps that's a central difference approximation? Wait, yes, this is the second-order central difference formula for the second derivative. So maybe the limit is indeed f''(0). But how to show that without using the Taylor series?

Alternatively, use the definition of the derivative. Let's recall that if f is differentiable, then f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + ε(h)h, where ε(h) → 0 as h → 0. Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + ε(-h)(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + ε(-h)(-h). But since ε is a function that goes to zero, ε(-h) also goes to zero as h → 0.

Then, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + ε(h)h] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + ε(-h)(-h)]

Simplify:

= f(0) + f'(0)h + ε(h)h - 2f(0) + f(0) - f'(0)h + ε(-h)(-h)

= [f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0)] + [f'(0)h - f'(0)h] + [ε(h)h + ε(-h)(-h)]

= 0 + 0 + h[ε(h) - ε(-h)]

So f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = h[ε(h) - ε(-h)]

Then, divide by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [ε(h) - ε(-h)] / h

But we need to evaluate the limit as h approaches 0 of this expression. However, since ε(h) → 0 as h → 0, and ε(-h) → 0 as h → 0, so both numerator terms go to zero. But is the difference [ε(h) - ε(-h)] going to zero faster than h? Not necessarily. Wait, but if f''(0) exists, then f' is differentiable at 0, so maybe we can use a better approximation.

Wait, maybe this approach isn't sufficient. Let's see. If f''(0) exists, then f' is differentiable at 0, so f'(h) = f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Then, maybe f(h) can be integrated or something. Wait, but how?

Alternatively, use the mean value theorem. For example, consider f(h) - f(0) = f'(c)h for some c between 0 and h. Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) = f'(d)(-h) for some d between -h and 0. But then, combining these might not give us the second derivative.

Alternatively, use the definition of the second derivative. Since f''(0) exists, then:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

Similarly, if we can express the given limit in terms of f'(h) - f'(0), then maybe we can relate it to f''(0).

But let's see. Let's consider the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me write this as [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h². But that's similar to the expression I had before. Wait, but if I take [f(h) - f(0)] / h², that's like the second derivative, but actually, the second derivative is the limit as h→0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. Maybe we can connect these.

Alternatively, use the difference quotient for the second derivative. Let me recall that the second derivative can be expressed as the limit of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h as h→0. So if I can express the given limit in terms of f'(h) - f'(0), then maybe we can relate them.

But how?

Let me try to write the given expression in terms of f'(h) - f'(0). Let's consider the original expression:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

I can write this as [f(h) - f(0) - (f(0) - f(-h))] / h². Which is [f(h) - f(0)] / h² - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h². But not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider the difference f(h) - f(-h). Let's write that as [f(h) - f(0)] - [f(-h) - f(0)]. Then, [f(h) - f(-h)] / h² = [f(h) - f(0) - f(-h) + f(0)] / h² = [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Wait, that's exactly the expression we have. So [f(h) - f(-h)] / h² = [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². But how does this relate to the second derivative?

Wait, the second derivative is the limit as h→0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. So perhaps if I can express f(h) - f(-h) in terms of f'(x), then integrate or something.

Alternatively, use the Mean Value Theorem for derivatives. For f(h) - f(0), by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a c in (0, h) such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c)h. Similarly, for f(-h) - f(0), there exists a d in (-h, 0) such that f(-h) - f(0) = f'(d)(-h). But then:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(c)h] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(d)h] = f'(c)h - f'(d)h

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h

But as h→0, c and d both approach 0. If f''(0) exists, then f' is differentiable at 0, so f'(c) = f'(0) + f''(0)c + o(c), and similarly f'(d) = f'(0) + f''(0)d + o(d). Therefore:

[f'(c) - f'(d)] / h = [f'(0) + f''(0)c + o(c) - f'(0) - f''(0)d - o(d)] / h = [f''(0)(c - d) + o(c) - o(d)] / h

But c is between 0 and h, so c = θh for some θ ∈ (0,1), and d is between -h and 0, so d = -φh for some φ ∈ (0,1). Therefore, c - d = θh - (-φh) = (θ + φ)h. Then:

[f''(0)(θ + φ)h + o(h)] / h = f''(0)(θ + φ) + o(1)

But as h→0, θ and φ can vary, but the average value of θ + φ when h approaches 0? Wait, but this approach might not be straightforward because θ and φ depend on h. Alternatively, since both c and d approach 0 as h approaches 0, and f''(0) exists, maybe we can take the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h.

But [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h = [f'(c) - f'(0) + f'(0) - f'(d)] / h = [f'(c) - f'(0)] / h + [f'(0) - f'(d)] / h

But [f'(c) - f'(0)] / h = [f'(c) - f'(0)] / (c - 0) * (c / h). Similarly, [f'(0) - f'(d)] / h = [f'(0) - f'(d)] / (0 - d) * ( -d / h). Since f''(0) exists, the limits of [f'(c) - f'(0)] / c as c→0 is f''(0), and similarly [f'(0) - f'(d)] / (-d) as d→0 is f''(0). Therefore:

[f'(c) - f'(0)] / h = [f''(0) + o(1)] * (c / h)

Similarly, [f'(0) - f'(d)] / h = [f''(0) + o(1)] * (-d / h)

But c = θh and d = -φh, so c/h = θ and -d/h = φ. Therefore, the first term becomes [f''(0) + o(1)] * θ, and the second term becomes [f''(0) + o(1)] * φ. Adding them together:

[f''(0)θ + o(1)θ] + [f''(0)φ + o(1)φ] = f''(0)(θ + φ) + o(1)(θ + φ)

But θ and φ are between 0 and 1, so θ + φ is between 0 and 2. However, as h approaches 0, θ and φ can approach any values in (0,1), but we need to take the limit. Wait, this seems a bit stuck. Maybe this approach isn't the best way.

Going back to the Taylor series approach. Since f''(0) exists, the Taylor expansion up to the second order is valid, so f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²), and similarly for f(-h). Then, when we compute f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h), the linear terms cancel out, leaving the quadratic term and higher order terms. Then, dividing by h², the limit is f''(0). That seems straightforward, but I need to confirm that the o(h²) terms are negligible when divided by h².

But the problem says to not use L'Hospital's rule. Is the Taylor expansion approach considered acceptable? The problem doesn't restrict using Taylor expansions, only L'Hospital's rule. So maybe that's okay.

Alternatively, another method: consider the definition of the second derivative as the limit of the average rate of change of the first derivative. But how to connect that to the given limit.

Wait, here's another idea. Let's consider the difference quotient for the second derivative. The second derivative at 0 is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. So if we can express the given limit in terms of this.

But the given limit is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let's see if we can relate this to f'(h) - f'(0). Let's recall that f'(h) = lim_{k→0} [f(h + k) - f(h)] / k. Similarly, f'(0) = lim_{k→0} [f(k) - f(0)] / k. So f'(h) - f'(0) = lim_{k→0} [f(h + k) - f(h) - f(k) + f(0)] / k. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, use the mean value theorem for the difference f(h) - f(-h). But I think the Taylor expansion method is the most straightforward here.

Wait, let me check with an example. Suppose f(x) = x². Then f''(0) = 2. Let's compute the limit:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [h² - 0 + (-h)²] / h² = (h² + h²)/h² = 2, which matches f''(0). Another example: f(x) = x³. Then f''(0) = 0. Compute the limit:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [h³ - 0 + (-h)³]/h² = (h³ - h³)/h² = 0/h² = 0, which matches f''(0). So the formula works in these cases.

Another example: f(x) = e^x. Then f''(0) = 1. Compute the limit:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [e^h - 2 + e^{-h}]/h². Using Taylor series for e^h = 1 + h + h²/2 + o(h²), and e^{-h} = 1 - h + h²/2 + o(h²). Then:

[e^h - 2 + e^{-h}] = (1 + h + h²/2) + (1 - h + h²/2) - 2 + o(h²) = (2 + h²) - 2 + o(h²) = h² + o(h²). Divided by h² gives 1 + o(1), so the limit is 1. Correct.

Therefore, the Taylor series approach works. So the key steps are expanding f(h) and f(-h) around 0 using the Taylor series up to the second order, subtracting 2f(0), adding the two expansions, and then dividing by h². The linear terms cancel, and the quadratic term gives f''(0), while the higher-order terms vanish as h→0.

Therefore, the proof is complete.

","Okay, so I need to show that if f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). And I can't use L'Hospital's rule in the proof. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, since f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, that tells me that f is twice differentiable at 0. That's good because we need the second derivative at zero for the limit to exist as f''(0). 

The expression given is a symmetric difference quotient for the second derivative. I remember that sometimes, the second derivative can be approximated using central differences. The formula here is similar to the central difference formula for the second derivative, which is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². So, maybe that's why this limit should give f''(0). But how do I prove it without using L'Hospital's rule?

Let me recall the Taylor series expansion. Since f is twice differentiable at 0, I can write the Taylor expansion of f around 0 up to the second derivative term. The Taylor series for f(h) would be f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Similarly, for f(-h), substituting -h into the expansion, it would be f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). 

If I add these two expansions together, the first-order terms (the ones with h) will cancel out. Let's try that:

f(h) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Adding these terms:

= 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²) + o(h²)

So, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) would be [f(h) + f(-h)] - 2f(0) = [2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, when we divide by h², we get [f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h² = f''(0) + [o(h²)/h²]

Now, the term o(h²)/h² should tend to 0 as h approaches 0, right? Because o(h²) represents terms that go to zero faster than h². So, the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h)-2f(0)+f(-h)]/h² would be f''(0) + 0 = f''(0). 

Wait, but is this rigorous enough? Let me check again. The Taylor expansion is valid if f is twice differentiable at 0, which is given. So, the f''(0)h² term is the second-order term, and the remainder is o(h²). Then, when we subtract 2f(0), the 2f(0) cancels out from the two f(0) terms. Then, adding the two expansions gives 2f(0) plus the sum of the higher-order terms. Then subtracting 2f(0) leaves the higher-order terms. So, yes, the leading term is f''(0)h², and the rest are o(h²). Dividing by h² gives f''(0) plus something that goes to zero. Therefore, the limit is f''(0). 

But wait, another thought: the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Does this imply that f is twice differentiable in a neighborhood around 0? Because the Taylor expansion with the Peano remainder (which is what the o(h²) notation represents) requires that f is twice differentiable at 0, but maybe not necessarily in a neighborhood. Hmm, but the problem only mentions f''(0) exists, so perhaps the expansion is valid as h approaches 0. The remainder term o(h²) is sufficient here because as h approaches 0, the remainder becomes negligible compared to h². So, even if f is only twice differentiable at 0, the expansion still holds in the sense of the limit. So, this approach should work.

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of the second derivative. The second derivative at 0 is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But how does that relate to the given expression?

Alternatively, perhaps express f(h) and f(-h) using the derivative at 0. Since f is differentiable at 0, we can write f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + f''(0)h²/2 + o(h²), as before. Similarly for f(-h). Then, substituting into the expression:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [ (f(0) + f'(0)h + f''(0)h²/2 + o(h²)) + (f(0) - f'(0)h + f''(0)h²/2 + o(h²)) - 2f(0) ] / h²

Simplify numerator:

= [2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²) - 2f(0)] / h²

= [f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h²

= f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, o(h²)/h² approaches 0, so the limit is f''(0). That seems straightforward.

But let me check if there's another way without using Taylor series. Maybe using the definition of derivative and some algebraic manipulations.

Suppose we consider the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me denote the numerator as N(h). Then N(h) = f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h). Let's try to express this in terms of derivatives.

First, note that N(h) = [f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)]. So, the numerator is the sum of two differences: f(h) - f(0) and f(-h) - f(0). Since f is differentiable at 0, we can write:

f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + o(h)

Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) = f'(0)(-h) + o(-h) = -f'(0)h + o(h)

Therefore, adding these two expressions:

N(h) = [f'(0)h + o(h)] + [-f'(0)h + o(h)] = o(h) + o(h) = o(h)

Wait, that gives N(h) = o(h), but then dividing by h² would give N(h)/h² = o(h)/h² = o(1/h), which would go to 0 as h approaches 0. But that contradicts the desired result. So, this approach must be missing something. Where did I go wrong?

Ah, because we need to take into account higher-order terms. The problem is that just using the first-order approximation of f(h) - f(0) gives us o(h), but when we subtract 2f(0), the first-order terms cancel, but the second-order terms remain. Therefore, we need a better approximation of f(h) and f(-h) to get the second-order terms.

So, going back to the Taylor expansion approach is more accurate here. If we use the second-order Taylor expansion, then we can capture the f''(0)h² term, which is necessary for the limit to be finite and equal to f''(0). Therefore, the initial approach with Taylor series is correct.

Alternatively, another method is to use the second derivative definition. Let's consider the second derivative f''(0) as the limit of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h as h approaches 0. But how does that relate to the original limit?

Alternatively, perhaps express the original limit as a combination of derivatives. Let's see:

Starting with [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let's split this into two parts: [f(h) - f(0)] / h² - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h². Wait, but [f(0) - f(-h)] / h² is the same as [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h)^2, which is similar to the original expression. Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, consider the expression as [f(h) - f(0) - f'(0)h] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0) + f'(0)h] / h². Wait, let's see:

If I rewrite the original expression:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f(h) - f(0) - f'(0)h + f'(0)h - 2f(0) + f(-h) + f(0) - f'(0)h] / h²

Wait, this seems convoluted. Maybe another approach: Let's express f(h) using the definition of derivative. Since f is differentiable at 0, we can write:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + f''(0)h²/2 + o(h²)

Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + f''(0)h²/2 + o(h²)

Adding these two equations:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, o(h²)/h² approaches 0, so the limit is f''(0). This seems consistent.

Alternatively, is there a way to express this using derivatives without Taylor series? Let's think.

Suppose we consider the difference quotient for the second derivative. The standard symmetric difference quotient for the second derivative is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h², which is exactly the expression given here. The question is, how to show that this converges to f''(0).

Another approach is to use the Mean Value Theorem or some form of average difference. For example, consider the first derivatives at h and -h. Let's denote f'(h) and f'(-h). The second derivative at 0 can be related to the average rate of change of the first derivative around 0.

The second derivative f''(0) is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. Similarly, f''(0) is also the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(0) - f'(-h)] / h. If we average these two expressions, maybe we can get something.

Let's compute:

[f'(h) - f'(0)] / h + [f'(0) - f'(-h)] / h = [f'(h) - f'(-h)] / h

But how does this relate to the original expression? Let's see.

Alternatively, using the definition of the derivative:

f'(h) = lim_{k->0} [f(h + k) - f(h)] / k

Similarly, f'(-h) = lim_{k->0} [f(-h + k) - f(-h)] / k

But this might complicate things. Maybe integrating or differentiating the original expression.

Wait, perhaps we can express the original limit as a combination of derivatives. Let's consider:

Let’s denote the expression as L = lim_{h->0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let’s consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the definition of derivative. Since f is differentiable at 0, we can write:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + ε₁(h)h

where ε₁(h) -> 0 as h -> 0.

Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + ε₂(-h)(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + ε₂(-h)(-h)

Adding these two:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + [f'(0)h - f'(0)h] + ε₁(h)h - ε₂(-h)h

Simplifying:

= 2f(0) + h[ε₁(h) - ε₂(-h)]

Subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = h[ε₁(h) - ε₂(-h)]

Therefore, the original expression L becomes:

lim_{h->0} h[ε₁(h) - ε₂(-h)] / h² = lim_{h->0} [ε₁(h) - ε₂(-h)] / h

But ε₁(h) and ε₂(-h) both tend to 0 as h -> 0, so we have a 0/0 indeterminate form. Wait, but this is the problem: if we just use the first-order approximation, we end up with an expression that is 0/0, which isn't helpful. Therefore, we need a better approximation of f(h) and f(-h) to capture the second-order terms.

Therefore, going back to the Taylor expansion is necessary here. Because using only the first derivative gives us an indeterminate form when divided by h², but using the second derivative gives us the correct non-zero limit.

Therefore, the correct approach is to use the Taylor expansion up to the second order, which includes the f''(0)h² term. Then, when we subtract 2f(0), the f''(0)h² term remains, and dividing by h² gives us f''(0) plus a term that goes to zero. Thus, the limit is f''(0).

Another way to think about this is in terms of the symmetric difference quotient. The symmetric difference quotient for the second derivative is known to approximate f''(0) when h is small. The formula [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² is indeed the standard symmetric second difference quotient, and its limit as h approaches 0 is f''(0). This is a well-known result in numerical analysis, and the proof relies on the Taylor expansion as we did earlier.

Alternatively, we can use integration. Suppose we integrate f''(0) twice. But that might be more complicated. Let's see:

If f''(0) exists, then f'(x) can be written as f'(0) + f''(0)x + o(x) as x approaches 0. Then, integrating f'(x) from 0 to h, we get f(h) - f(0) = ∫₀^h [f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t)] dt = f'(0)h + (f''(0)/2)h² + o(h²). Similarly, integrating from 0 to -h, f(-h) - f(0) = -f'(0)h + (f''(0)/2)h² + o(h²). Adding these gives f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²), leading to the same conclusion when divided by h².

This method also works and uses integration instead of Taylor series, but it's essentially equivalent in spirit.

Another approach: consider the original limit as a combination of derivatives. Let’s define g(h) = [f(h) - f(0)] / h, which is the difference quotient for f'(0). Then, the original expression can be written as [g(h) - g(-h)] / h. But wait, let's check:

Original expression: [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f(h) - f(0) - f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [ (f(h) - f(0)) - (f(0) - f(-h)) ] / h² = [ (f(h) - f(0)) / h - (f(0) - f(-h)) / h ] / h = [g(h) - (-g(-h))] / h = [g(h) + g(-h)] / h

But if we write this as [g(h) + g(-h)] / h, then taking the limit as h approaches 0 would be lim_{h->0} [g(h) + g(-h)] / h. However, g(h) approaches f'(0), so [g(h) + g(-h)] approaches 2f'(0), leading to 2f'(0)/0, which is problematic. Therefore, this approach might not work unless we consider higher-order terms in g(h).

But since g(h) = [f(h) - f(0)] / h = f'(0) + f''(0)h / 2 + o(h), then g(h) + g(-h) = 2f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Therefore, [g(h) + g(-h)] / h = 2f'(0)/h + f''(0) + o(1). As h approaches 0, 2f'(0)/h term would go to infinity unless f'(0) is zero. But this is not necessarily the case. Therefore, this approach seems to lead to an indeterminate form unless we capture the higher-order terms properly.

This suggests that without using Taylor expansions or considering higher-order terms, it's difficult to evaluate the limit properly. Hence, the most straightforward and rigorous method is to use the Taylor expansion of f around 0 up to the second derivative term, which allows us to isolate the f''(0)h² term and demonstrate that the limit is indeed f''(0).

In summary, the key steps are:

1. Expand f(h) and f(-h) using the Taylor series with Peano remainder up to the second order.
2. Add the two expansions to eliminate the first-order terms.
3. Subtract 2f(0) to isolate the second-order term.
4. Divide by h² and take the limit as h approaches 0, noting that the remainder terms vanish.

This method avoids using L'Hospital's rule and directly uses the definition of the second derivative via the Taylor expansion, which is appropriate given the problem's constraints.

","Okay, so I need to show that if a function f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). Hmm, let's see. I remember that when dealing with limits involving derivatives, Taylor expansions or the mean value theorem might be useful here. Since we can't use L'Hospital's rule, maybe expanding the function around 0 using its derivatives would help.

First, let's recall that if a function is differentiable at 0, it has a derivative there, and if f''(0) exists, that means the first derivative is differentiable at 0. So f is twice differentiable at 0. Therefore, we can write the Taylor expansion of f(h) and f(-h) around 0 up to the second order term. The Taylor series for f(h) would be f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²), and similarly for f(-h), it would be f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)² + o(h²). Let me write that down:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)
f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Now, if I subtract 2f(0) from f(h) and add f(-h), let's compute the numerator:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Simplifying term by term:

The f(0) terms: f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) = 0
The f'(0)h terms: f'(0)h - f'(0)h = 0
The (1/2)f''(0)h² terms: (1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² = f''(0)h²
The o(h²) terms: o(h²) + o(h²) = o(h²) (since o(h²) is negligible compared to h² as h approaches 0)

So the numerator simplifies to f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, when we divide by h², we get:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, the term o(h²)/h² goes to 0 because the little-o notation means that the remainder is much smaller than h². Therefore, the limit as h approaches 0 is f''(0). That seems straightforward, but let me check if there are any assumptions I might have missed.

Wait, the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. So f is twice differentiable at 0, which is exactly what I used in the Taylor expansion. Therefore, the steps are valid. The key idea is that the linear terms (the f'(0)h terms) cancel out when we take the combination f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h), leaving the quadratic term which is related to the second derivative. Dividing by h² and taking the limit gives the desired result.

Is there another way to approach this without using Taylor series? Maybe using the definition of the second derivative. Let's think. The second derivative at 0 is the derivative of the first derivative at 0. So f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But how does that connect to the given limit?

Alternatively, we can use the average rate of change. The expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² resembles the second difference quotient, which is a central difference approximation for the second derivative. Indeed, the central difference formula for the second derivative is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h², and as h approaches 0, this converges to f''(0). But to prove it without using the Taylor series, maybe we can use the definition of the derivative.

Let me try that. Let's start by considering the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let's write this as [f(h) - f(0) - (f(0) - f(-h))] / h². The numerator can be thought of as the difference between [f(h) - f(0)] and [f(0) - f(-h)], divided by h².

But [f(h) - f(0)] / h is the average rate of change from 0 to h, which approaches f'(0) as h approaches 0. Similarly, [f(0) - f(-h)] / h is the average rate of change from -h to 0, which also approaches f'(0) as h approaches 0. Therefore, [f(h) - f(0) - (f(0) - f(-h))] / h² is like [f'(0) - f'(0)] / h² plus some error terms, but that seems too vague.

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the difference f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) in terms of derivatives. Let's consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the first derivative. Let's write:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + ε₁(h)h
f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + ε₂(h)h

where ε₁(h) and ε₂(h) are remainder terms such that lim_{h→0} ε₁(h) = lim_{h→0} ε₂(h) = 0. Then:

f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + ε₁(h)h] + [f(0) - f'(0)h + ε₂(h)h] - 2f(0)
= 2f(0) + (ε₁(h) + ε₂(h))h - 2f(0)
= (ε₁(h) + ε₂(h))h

So the numerator is (ε₁(h) + ε₂(h))h, and dividing by h² gives (ε₁(h) + ε₂(h))/h. Taking the limit as h approaches 0, we get:

lim_{h→0} (ε₁(h) + ε₂(h))/h

But this is not directly helpful because we don't know the behavior of (ε₁ + ε₂)/h as h approaches 0. However, since f is twice differentiable at 0, we can get a better approximation by considering the second derivatives. The error terms ε₁(h) and ε₂(h) should be o(1) as h approaches 0, but we need a better approximation to get the second derivative.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the mean value theorem for the difference f(h) - f(0). The mean value theorem states that there exists a point c between 0 and h such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c)h. Similarly, for the difference f(0) - f(-h), there exists a point d between -h and 0 such that f(0) - f(-h) = f'(d)h. Then, the numerator becomes f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = (f(h) - f(0)) - (f(0) - f(-h)) = f'(c)h - f'(d)h. But this gives:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h

Taking the limit as h approaches 0, we need to evaluate lim_{h→0} [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h. If c and d approach 0 as h approaches 0, then f'(c) and f'(d) approach f'(0). However, the difference [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h is not immediately obvious. This might not be the right approach, as we still need to relate this to the second derivative.

Let me try to use the definition of the derivative twice. Let's denote that f'(0) exists, so:

f'(0) = lim_{h→0} [f(h) - f(0)] / h

Similarly, f''(0) is the derivative of f' at 0, so:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But how do we connect this to the given limit? Let's consider the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let's split this into two parts:

[f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h²

But that might not help. Alternatively, express the entire expression as:

[ (f(h) - f(0)) / h² - (f(0) - f(-h)) / h² ]

But again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps if we consider the difference quotient for the second derivative. The second derivative can be defined as the limit:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But how to relate this to the given expression. Let me try to express f'(h) - f'(0) in terms of the given limit. Let's see:

From the problem's limit, we have:

lim_{h→0} [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0)

But according to the Taylor expansion approach, this is just the definition of the second derivative. So maybe the key idea is that the central difference approximation [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² converges to f''(0) as h approaches 0. However, to prove this without using Taylor series, perhaps we can use the definition of the derivative.

Suppose we define the average of the first derivatives at h and -h. Let's consider:

[f(h) - f(0)] / h - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h = [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h

But this is the first difference quotient. Then, if we take another difference quotient of this expression, we get:

lim_{h→0} [ ([f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h ) - f'(0) ] / h

Wait, that might not be the right approach. Let me set g(h) = [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Then, the problem is to show that lim_{h→0} g(h) = f''(0). Maybe we can express g(h) in terms of the second derivative.

Alternatively, consider the definition of the second derivative as a limit of the average rate of change of the first derivative. So:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [ (1/h)[f'(h) - f'(0)] ]

If we can express the given limit in terms of this, then we can connect them.

Let me try to relate the given expression to f'(h) - f'(0). Let's write:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [ (f(h) - f(0)) - (f(0) - f(-h)) ] / h²

We can write each difference as an average rate of change:

= [ ( [f(h) - f(0)] / h ) - ( [f(0) - f(-h)] / h ) ] / h

= [ (f'(0) + ε₁(h)) - (f'(0) + ε₂(h)) ] / h, where ε₁(h) and ε₂(h) are the errors in the difference quotients, so lim_{h→0} ε₁(h) = lim_{h→0} ε₂(h) = 0.

Therefore, this becomes [ (ε₁(h) - ε₂(h)) ] / h. Taking the limit as h approaches 0, we get:

lim_{h→0} (ε₁(h) - ε₂(h)) / h

But this again seems stuck because we don't know the behavior of ε₁ - ε₂ over h. However, since f is twice differentiable, the errors ε₁(h) and ε₂(h) are actually o(1) as h approaches 0, but perhaps we can get a better approximation by considering the second derivative.

Wait, maybe if we use the mean value theorem for the differences f(h) - f(0) and f(0) - f(-h). Let's apply the mean value theorem to f on the interval [0, h] and [ -h, 0 ].

For the interval [0, h], there exists c₁ in (0, h) such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c₁)h.

Similarly, for the interval [ -h, 0 ], there exists c₂ in (-h, 0) such that f(0) - f(-h) = f'(c₂)h.

Therefore, the numerator becomes f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(h) - f(0)] - [f(0) - f(-h)] = f'(c₁)h - f'(c₂)h.

So the expression is [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] h / h² = [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] / h.

Now, we need to find the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] / h.

But c₁ is between 0 and h, so as h approaches 0, c₁ approaches 0. Similarly, c₂ is between -h and 0, so c₂ approaches 0 as h approaches 0.

Therefore, f'(c₁) approaches f'(0) and f'(c₂) approaches f'(0). But again, the difference [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] / h is like [f'(0) - f'(0)] / h, which is 0, but we need to capture the second derivative.

Hmm, maybe we need to apply the mean value theorem again to the derivatives. Let's consider f'(c₁) - f'(0) = f''(d₁)c₁ for some d₁ between c₁ and 0, and f'(0) - f'(c₂) = f''(d₂)(-c₂) for some d₂ between c₂ and 0. Therefore:

f'(c₁) - f'(c₂) = [f'(c₁) - f'(0)] + [f'(0) - f'(c₂)] = f''(d₁)c₁ + f''(d₂)(-c₂)

Therefore, [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] / h = [f''(d₁)c₁ - f''(d₂)c₂] / h

But c₁ is between 0 and h, so c₁ = h + o(h), and c₂ is between -h and 0, so c₂ = -h + o(h). Therefore:

= [f''(d₁)(h + o(h)) - f''(d₂)(-h + o(h))]/h
= [f''(d₁)h + f''(d₂)h + o(h)] / h
= f''(d₁) + f''(d₂) + o(1)

Since d₁ and d₂ approach 0 as h approaches 0, and f'' is continuous at 0 (since f''(0) exists), then f''(d₁) and f''(d₂) approach f''(0). Therefore, the limit becomes f''(0) + f''(0) + 0 = 2f''(0). Wait, but this contradicts the original problem which claims the limit is f''(0). So there must be an error here.

Wait, perhaps my application of the mean value theorem was incorrect. Let me check that step again. When I applied the mean value theorem to f on [0, h], I got f(h) - f(0) = f'(c₁)h, and similarly for [ -h, 0 ], f(0) - f(-h) = f'(c₂)h. Then, the numerator is f'(c₁)h - f'(c₂)h. So the expression is [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] h / h² = [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] / h. Then, applying the mean value theorem to f' on [c₂, c₁] (assuming c₂ < c₁), there exists d in (c₂, c₁) such that [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] / (c₁ - c₂) = f''(d). Therefore, [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] = f''(d)(c₁ - c₂). Then, the expression becomes f''(d)(c₁ - c₂)/h.

Now, c₁ is in (0, h) and c₂ is in (-h, 0), so c₁ - c₂ = c₁ + (-c₂) which is less than h + h = 2h. Therefore, |c₁ - c₂| ≤ 2h. Therefore, |f''(d)(c₁ - c₂)/h| ≤ |f''(d)| * 2h / h = 2|f''(d)|. Since f'' is continuous at 0, |f''(d)| is bounded near 0, so the expression is bounded, but we need it to approach f''(0).

But how to relate this? Let's note that c₁ and c₂ approach 0 as h approaches 0, so d also approaches 0. Therefore, f''(d) approaches f''(0). Therefore, [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] / h = f''(d)(c₁ - c₂)/h. Let's write c₁ - c₂ = (h - c₂) since c₁ < h and c₂ > -h. Wait, maybe not. Let's see:

c₁ is between 0 and h, so c₁ = h - ε₁ where ε₁ is between 0 and h.

c₂ is between -h and 0, so c₂ = -h + ε₂ where ε₂ is between 0 and h.

Therefore, c₁ - c₂ = (h - ε₁) - (-h + ε₂) = 2h - ε₁ - ε₂

Therefore, [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] / h = f''(d)(2h - ε₁ - ε₂)/h = 2f''(d) - (ε₁ + ε₂)/h

Taking the limit as h approaches 0, the term (ε₁ + ε₂)/h. Since ε₁ and ε₂ are between 0 and h, ε₁ + ε₂ is between 0 and 2h, so (ε₁ + ε₂)/h is between 0 and 2. However, we need to show that this term goes to 0. Wait, but if ε₁ and ε₂ are the differences between h and c₁, and between c₂ and -h, respectively, then:

c₁ = h - ε₁ => ε₁ = h - c₁

Similarly, c₂ = -h + ε₂ => ε₂ = c₂ + h

But as h approaches 0, c₁ and c₂ approach 0, so ε₁ and ε₂ also approach 0. Therefore, ε₁ + ε₂ = (h - c₁) + (c₂ + h) = 2h - c₁ + c₂. Hmm, not sure. Wait, maybe I need to bound ε₁ and ε₂.

Alternatively, since c₁ is in (0, h), then ε₁ = h - c₁ is between 0 and h. Similarly, ε₂ = c₂ + h is between 0 and h. Therefore, ε₁ + ε₂ is between 0 and 2h. Therefore, (ε₁ + ε₂)/h is between 0 and 2. So as h approaches 0, (ε₁ + ε₂)/h is bounded but doesn't necessarily go to 0. Therefore, the term 2f''(d) - (ε₁ + ε₂)/h might not have a well-defined limit unless the (ε₁ + ε₂)/h term cancels out.

This seems complicated. Maybe the Taylor expansion approach is more straightforward. Let's go back to that. Since the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, the Taylor expansion up to the second order is valid. Then, as I did earlier, expanding f(h) and f(-h), subtracting 2f(0), and dividing by h² gives the second derivative. Therefore, the limit is f''(0).

Alternatively, another approach is to use the definition of the derivative. Let's consider the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let's write this as:

[f(h) - f(0) - (f(0) - f(-h))] / h²

Let’s denote A(h) = f(h) - f(0) and B(h) = f(0) - f(-h). Then, the expression is (A(h) - B(h)) / h².

We know that A(h)/h = [f(h) - f(0)] / h → f'(0) as h→0, and similarly B(h)/h = [f(0) - f(-h)] / h → f'(0) as h→0. So A(h) - B(h) = h[f'(0) + o(1)] - h[f'(0) + o(1)] = o(h²). Wait, but then (A(h) - B(h))/h² would be o(h²)/h² = o(1), which tends to 0. But this contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, this approach must be missing something.

Ah, here's the problem: if we write A(h) = f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²), and similarly B(h) = f(0) - f(-h) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Then A(h) - B(h) = (f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)) - (f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)) ) = o(h²). Therefore, (A(h) - B(h))/h² = o(h²)/h² = o(1) → 0. But according to the problem statement, the limit is f''(0). So there's a contradiction here. Wait, what's wrong?

Wait, no. Wait, let's compute A(h) - B(h):

A(h) = f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

B(h) = f(0) - f(-h) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, A(h) - B(h) = [f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - [f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] = o(h²) - o(h²) = o(h²)

Wait, but then (A(h) - B(h))/h² = o(h²)/h² = o(1), which tends to 0. But the problem states that the limit is f''(0). This suggests a mistake in my calculation. Wait, no. Wait, let me check again.

Wait, when I subtract B(h) from A(h):

A(h) - B(h) = [f(h) - f(0)] - [f(0) - f(-h)] = f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)

Which is exactly the numerator in the problem. So according to the Taylor expansion, this is equal to f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, (A(h) - B(h))/h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h² → f''(0). But in my previous step, when I subtracted A(h) - B(h), I got o(h²). But that must be wrong because the actual expansion gives f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, my mistake was in the previous calculation where I thought A(h) and B(h) both had f'(0)h terms, but when subtracted, they canceled out, leaving the quadratic terms. However, in the previous step, when I wrote A(h) - B(h) = o(h²), that's incorrect because actually, the quadratic terms do not cancel. Let me redo that.

Given A(h) = f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

B(h) = f(0) - f(-h) = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, A(h) - B(h) = [f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - [f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

= f'(0)h - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² - (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) - o(h²)

= 0 + 0 + o(h²) - o(h²)

Wait, this suggests that A(h) - B(h) = o(h²), which contradicts the earlier conclusion. But according to the problem, A(h) - B(h) should be f''(0)h² + o(h²). There's a contradiction here. Therefore, I must have made an error in expanding B(h).

Wait, let's check the expansion of f(-h). If f is differentiable at 0, then f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)^2 + o(h^2). Therefore, B(h) = f(0) - f(-h) = f(0) - [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] = f'(0)h - (1/2)f''(0)h² - o(h²)

Wait, hold on, that's different! I think I made a mistake in the earlier expansion. Let's redo the expansion carefully.

For f(h):

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

For f(-h):

f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)^2 + o((-h)^2) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, B(h) = f(0) - f(-h) = f(0) - [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] = f'(0)h - (1/2)f''(0)h² - o(h²)

So now, A(h) - B(h) = [f(h) - f(0)] - [f(0) - f(-h)] = [f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - [f'(0)h - (1/2)f''(0)h² - o(h²)]

= f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

= (1/2 + 1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) + o(h²)

= f''(0)h² + o(h²) + o(h²)

= f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, (A(h) - B(h))/h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h² → f''(0) as h→0. Ah, there we go! My earlier mistake was in the expansion of B(h). I incorrectly thought B(h) was f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²), but actually, B(h) = f'(0)h - (1/2)f''(0)h² - o(h²). Therefore, when subtracting A(h) - B(h), the f''(0)h² terms add up, giving f''(0)h², and the rest are o(h²). Therefore, the limit is f''(0).

This confirms the initial approach using Taylor series was correct. The key was properly expanding f(-h) to include the negative sign in the linear term and the positive h² term, leading to the cancellation of the linear terms and the addition of the quadratic terms. Therefore, the limit indeed evaluates to f''(0).

","Okay, so I need to show that if f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). And I can't use L'Hospital's rule. Hmm, let's think.

First, since f is differentiable at 0, that means f'(0) exists. Also, f''(0) exists, so the second derivative at 0 is there. Maybe I can use the definition of the second derivative here. The second derivative is the derivative of the first derivative. So f''(0) is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But wait, how does that connect to the given expression?

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Taylor series expansion. If f is twice differentiable at 0, then we can write f(h) as a Taylor expansion around 0. Let me recall: f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Similarly, f(-h) would be f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)² + o(h²). So f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Now, let's compute f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h). Plugging in the expansions:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Simplify term by term:

First term: f(0)
Second term: f'(0)h
Third term: (1/2)f''(0)h²
Fourth term: o(h²)
Fifth term: -2f(0)
Sixth term: f(0) - f'(0)h
Seventh term: (1/2)f''(0)h²
Eighth term: o(h²)

Combine like terms:

f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) = 0

f'(0)h - f'(0)h = 0

(1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² = f''(0)h²

o(h²) + o(h²) = o(h²)

So overall, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

Now, as h approaches 0, o(h²)/h² tends to 0, so the limit becomes f''(0). That seems straightforward. Wait, but did I use the Taylor expansion? The problem didn't state that f is twice differentiable, only that f''(0) exists. So maybe I need to be careful here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the definition of the second derivative without Taylor series. Let's recall that f''(0) is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But how can I relate that to the given expression?

Alternatively, perhaps use the definition of the first derivative. Let's think about the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me denote this as the limit L. If I can express this limit in terms of f'(0) and f''(0), then maybe I can show it equals f''(0).

Wait, maybe another approach. Let's consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) around 0 using the first-order Taylor expansion with a remainder term.

Since f is differentiable at 0, we can write f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + ε(h)h, where ε(h) → 0 as h → 0. Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + ε(-h)(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + ε(-h)(-h). So f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h - ε(-h)h.

Now, compute f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h):

= [f(0) + f'(0)h + ε(h)h] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h - ε(-h)h]

Simplify:

f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) = 0

f'(0)h - f'(0)h = 0

ε(h)h - ε(-h)h = h[ε(h) - ε(-h)]

So f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = h[ε(h) - ε(-h)]

Then divide by h²: [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [ε(h) - ε(-h)] / h

Now, take the limit as h → 0. We need to evaluate lim_{h→0} [ε(h) - ε(-h)] / h.

But since ε(h) → 0 as h → 0, and ε(-h) → 0 as h → 0, then both ε(h) and ε(-h) go to 0. However, the numerator is [ε(h) - ε(-h)] which is the difference of two quantities approaching 0. To evaluate the limit, we need to see if this difference is of order h.

Wait, but how do we know that? Maybe we need to use the fact that f''(0) exists. If f''(0) exists, then f'(h) can be approximated by f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Therefore, ε(h) = [f(h) - f(0) - f'(0)h]/h = [f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) - f'(0)h]/h = (1/2)f''(0)h + o(h²)/h = (1/2)f''(0)h + o(h). Similarly, ε(-h) = (1/2)f''(0)(-h) + o(h). Therefore, ε(h) - ε(-h) = (1/2)f''(0)h + o(h) - [ - (1/2)f''(0)h + o(h) ] = (1/2 + 1/2)f''(0)h + o(h) = f''(0)h + o(h). Therefore, [ε(h) - ε(-h)] / h = f''(0) + o(h)/h. As h → 0, o(h)/h tends to 0, so the limit is f''(0). Therefore, the original limit is f''(0). That works.

Wait, but this approach uses the expansion of f(h) in terms of the first derivative and the second derivative. But the problem states that f''(0) exists, so we can use that to approximate f'(h) as f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Therefore, ε(h) = [f(h) - f(0) - f'(0)h]/h ≈ [f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) - f'(0)h]/h = (1/2)f''(0)h + o(h). Therefore, ε(h) - ε(-h) ≈ (1/2)f''(0)h - (-1/2)f''(0)h + o(h) = f''(0)h + o(h). Then dividing by h gives f''(0) + o(1), so the limit is f''(0). That seems okay.

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of the second derivative. Let me recall that the second derivative at 0 is the limit of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h as h → 0. If we can relate this to the given expression, perhaps by expressing f'(h) and f'(-h) in terms of f(h) and f(-h).

Alternatively, perhaps consider the given expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me denote this as L. Let's consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) around 0 using the first-order approximation with the remainder term. Since f is differentiable at 0, we can write:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h)
f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h)

Then, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h)]
= f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) + f'(0)h - f'(0)h + o(h) + o(h)
= 0 + 0 + o(h) + o(h) = o(h)

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = o(h)/h² = o(1)/h, which tends to 0 as h → 0. But this contradicts the given statement that the limit is f''(0). So clearly, this approach is insufficient because it only uses the first-order approximation. Therefore, we need a higher-order approximation.

Since f''(0) exists, the function is twice differentiable at 0, meaning that the first derivative is differentiable at 0. Therefore, f'(h) = f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Then, integrating f'(h) to get f(h):

f(h) = f(0) + ∫₀^h f'(t) dt = f(0) + ∫₀^h [f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t)] dt
= f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Then, subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]
= f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) + f'(0)h - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) + o(h²)
= 0 + 0 + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h². As h → 0, o(h²)/h² → 0, so the limit is f''(0). This seems correct.

But wait, in this approach, I used the expansion of f(h) and f(-h) using the second derivative, which requires that f''(0) exists. The problem states that f''(0) exists, so this is acceptable. Therefore, the limit is indeed f''(0).

Alternatively, maybe use the definition of the second derivative directly. Let's recall that the second derivative at 0 can be defined as the limit:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But how does that relate to the given expression? Let me see. Let's consider the given expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let's denote this as L. If we can relate this to the difference quotient for the first derivative.

Alternatively, consider that [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] is similar to the symmetric difference quotient for the second derivative. Wait, actually, the symmetric difference quotient for the second derivative is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². So maybe that's the definition here. If that's the case, then by the definition of the second derivative, this limit is f''(0). But is the symmetric difference quotient always equal to the second derivative?

Well, if f is twice differentiable at 0, then yes, the symmetric difference quotient [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² will approach f''(0) as h → 0. Let me verify this.

Let me write f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²), and f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Then, substituting into the expression:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) - 2f(0) + f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]
= [0 + 0 + f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Therefore, dividing by h² gives f''(0) + o(h²)/h² → f''(0). So this confirms it.

But maybe the question is expecting a different approach without using Taylor series. Let's try another way.

Suppose we let h = 2k, so as h → 0, k → 0. Then the expression becomes [f(2k) - 2f(0) + f(-2k)] / (4k²). Maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, consider splitting the expression into two parts. Let me write [f(h) - f(0)] / h² - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h². But that might complicate things.

Wait, let's consider the average of the first derivative from the right and left. The symmetric derivative is [f(h) - f(-h)] / (2h). But the second derivative is the derivative of the first derivative. Hmm.

Alternatively, consider that the given expression is the difference between the average of f(h) and f(-h) minus 2f(0), all divided by h². This is similar to the second derivative's symmetric difference quotient. If I can express this in terms of the first derivative's difference quotient.

Let me denote the first derivative at 0 as f'(0). Then, the difference quotient for f'(h) is [f(h) - f(0)] / h, and for f'(-h) is [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h). The average of these two is [f(h) - f(0)] / h + [f(0) - f(-h)] / h divided by 2. But not sure.

Alternatively, let's consider the difference [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me write this as [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h². Let me denote g(h) = [f(h) + f(-h)] / 2. Then, the expression becomes [g(h) - f(0)] / h². But g(h) is the average of f(h) and f(-h). If f is twice differentiable at 0, then g(h) can be expanded as f(0) + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, [g(h) - f(0)] / h² = (1/2)f''(0) + o(1). Therefore, the limit is (1/2)f''(0). Wait, that's different. So this approach gives half of f''(0). But the original problem states that the limit should be f''(0). So this contradicts.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's check:

If g(h) = [f(h) + f(-h)] / 2, then expanding f(h) and f(-h):

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)
f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Adding them: f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)
Therefore, g(h) = [f(h) + f(-h)] / 2 = f(0) + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Then, [g(h) - f(0)] / h² = (1/2)f''(0) + o(h²)/h² → (1/2)f''(0) as h → 0. But this contradicts the problem statement. Therefore, my approach here is wrong. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, the problem says [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0). But according to this calculation, it's [g(h) - f(0)] / h² = (1/2)f''(0). But the original expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [g(h) - f(0)] / h² = (1/2)f''(0). Wait, so this suggests that the limit is (1/2)f''(0), which is different from the problem statement. So there must be a mistake here.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the limit is f''(0). So where is the mistake?

Wait, no. Wait, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)]. Then, [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = [g(h) - f(0)] / h² = (1/2)f''(0). But the problem says that this limit is f''(0). So there's a contradiction. Therefore, my previous calculations must be wrong.

Wait, let's check again. If f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²), then f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²). Therefore, dividing by h² gives f''(0) + o(h²)/h² → f''(0). Therefore, the limit is indeed f''(0). So my previous mistake was in defining g(h) as [f(h) + f(-h)] / 2, which gives [g(h) - f(0)] / h² = (1/2)f''(0). But the original expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² = f''(0) + o(1). Therefore, the correct limit is f''(0). So where did I go wrong in the previous step?

Ah, in defining g(h) as [f(h) + f(-h)] / 2, then [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h² is equal to [2g(h) - 2f(0)] / h² = 2[g(h) - f(0)] / h². But since g(h) = f(0) + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²), then [g(h) - f(0)] / h² = (1/2)f''(0) + o(1), so 2 times that is f''(0) + o(1). Therefore, the limit is f''(0). Therefore, the mistake was that when I first considered [g(h) - f(0)] / h², I forgot to multiply by 2. So [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = 2[g(h) - f(0)] / h², which is 2*(1/2 f''(0) + o(1)) = f''(0) + o(1). Therefore, the limit is f''(0). So that works.

Therefore, the key steps are expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the Taylor series up to the second order, subtracting 2f(0), and then dividing by h². This cancels out the first-order terms and leaves the second-order term, which is f''(0)h². Therefore, the limit is f''(0).

Alternatively, another approach is to use the definition of the second derivative without Taylor series. Let's recall that f''(0) exists, which means that f' is differentiable at 0. Therefore, using the definition of derivative:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h

But how can we relate this to the original expression?

Let me try to express the original expression in terms of f'(h) and f'(-h). Let's note that:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h²

If I consider the difference quotient for f'(h) and f'(-h):

The symmetric difference quotient for the first derivative is [f(h) - f(-h)] / (2h). But this is different.

Alternatively, consider the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me split this into two parts:

[f(h) - f(0)] / h² - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h²

But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, consider that:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = [f(h) - f(0) + f(-h) - f(0)]

So it's the sum of [f(h) - f(0)] and [f(-h) - f(0)]. Then, divide by h².

But [f(h) - f(0)] / h² is the same as [f(h) - f(0)] / h * 1/h, which is the difference quotient for f'(0) multiplied by 1/h, which tends to infinity. Similarly for the other term. So this approach might not work.

Alternatively, consider using the Mean Value Theorem. Let's think about the difference f(h) - f(0). By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists c₁ between 0 and h such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c₁)h. Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) = f'(c₂)(-h) for some c₂ between -h and 0. Then, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f'(c₁)h + f'(c₂)(-h) - 2f(0) + 2f(0) = f'(c₁)h - f'(c₂)h. Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] / h

But c₁ is between 0 and h, and c₂ is between -h and 0. So as h → 0, c₁ → 0 and c₂ → 0. Therefore, f'(c₁) - f'(c₂) ≈ f'(0) - f'(0) + f''(0)(c₁ + c₂) using a linear approximation. Wait, maybe not. Let's expand f'(c₁) and f'(c₂):

Since f''(0) exists, f'(c) = f'(0) + f''(0)c + o(c). Therefore, f'(c₁) = f'(0) + f''(0)c₁ + o(c₁), and f'(c₂) = f'(0) + f''(0)c₂ + o(c₂). Therefore, f'(c₁) - f'(c₂) = f''(0)(c₁ - c₂) + o(c₁ - c₂). But c₁ is between 0 and h, and c₂ is between -h and 0. Therefore, c₁ - c₂ is between h - 0 = h and 0 - (-h) = h. Wait, not sure. Maybe c₁ is approximately h and c₂ is approximately -h? Not necessarily, because the Mean Value Theorem states that c₁ is somewhere between 0 and h, which could be anywhere in that interval. Similarly for c₂.

However, as h → 0, c₁ and c₂ both approach 0. Therefore, c₁ - c₂ approaches 0. Therefore, the difference f'(c₁) - f'(c₂) is approximately f''(0)(c₁ - c₂). Therefore, [f'(c₁) - f'(c₂)] / h ≈ f''(0)(c₁ - c₂)/h. But c₁ - c₂ is some value between -h and h, but since c₁ is between 0 and h and c₂ is between -h and 0, c₁ - c₂ is between h - 0 = h and 0 - (-h) = h. Wait, actually, c₁ - c₂ is between h - 0 = h (if c₁ = h and c₂ = 0) and 0 - (-h) = h (if c₁ = 0 and c₂ = -h). Wait, no, that's not correct. If c₁ is in (0, h) and c₂ is in (-h, 0), then c₁ - c₂ is in (0 - (-h), h - 0) = (h, h). Wait, that can't be. Wait, if c₁ is in (0, h) and c₂ is in (-h, 0), then c₁ - c₂ is in (0 - (-h), h - 0) = (h, h). Wait, that's not possible. Wait, actually, c₁ is between 0 and h, so c₁ > 0. c₂ is between -h and 0, so c₂ < 0. Therefore, c₁ - c₂ is greater than 0 - (-h) = h. Wait, that's not right. Let's take specific values. Suppose c₁ = h/2 and c₂ = -h/2. Then c₁ - c₂ = h. If c₁ approaches 0 and c₂ approaches 0, then c₁ - c₂ approaches 0. But according to the Mean Value Theorem, the exact values of c₁ and c₂ depend on the function f. However, since f''(0) exists, we can approximate f'(c₁) - f'(c₂) using the derivative at 0.

Wait, perhaps instead of using the Mean Value Theorem, use the definition of the derivative for f':

Since f' is differentiable at 0, we have:

lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h = f''(0)

Similarly, lim_{h→0} [f'(-h) - f'(0)] / (-h) = f''(0)

Therefore, [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h → f''(0) and [f'(-h) - f'(0)] / (-h) → f''(0)

Therefore, [f'(h) - f'(0) + f'(-h) - f'(0)] / h = [f'(h) + f'(-h) - 2f'(0)] / h → 2f''(0)

Therefore, [f'(h) + f'(-h) - 2f'(0)] / h → 2f''(0)

But how does this relate to our original expression?

Wait, our original expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let's try to express this in terms of f'(h) and f'(-h). Let's consider integrating f'(t) to get f(t). So:

f(h) = f(0) + ∫₀^h f'(t) dt
f(-h) = f(0) + ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt = f(0) - ∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt

Therefore, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt - ∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt

But this might not be helpful. Alternatively, consider the difference f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt + ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt. Wait, no:

Wait, f(h) = f(0) + ∫₀^h f'(t) dt
f(-h) = f(0) + ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt = f(0) - ∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt

Therefore, f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt - ∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt + ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt + (-1)∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt (since ∫_{a}^b = -∫_{b}^a)

But this seems complicated. Maybe instead, consider the average of f'(h) and f'(-h):

[ f'(h) + f'(-h) ] / 2 = [f'(h) + f'(-h)] / 2

But from the earlier result, [f'(h) + f'(-h) - 2f'(0)] / h → 2f''(0). Therefore, [f'(h) + f'(-h)] / 2 = f'(0) + h f''(0) + o(h). Therefore, [f'(h) + f'(-h)] / 2 = f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Integrating this from 0 to h and -h:

Wait, not sure. Alternatively, since [f'(h) + f'(-h)] / 2 = f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Therefore, multiplying both sides by h:

h [f'(h) + f'(-h)] / 2 = h f'(0) + h² f''(0) + o(h²)

But f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt + ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt - ∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt

Let me denote the integral from -h to 0 as ∫_{-h}^0 f'(t) dt = -∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt. Therefore, f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt + ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt. Let me make a substitution in the second integral: let t = -s, so when t = 0, s = 0; t = -h, s = h. Therefore, ∫₀^{-h} f'(t) dt = ∫₀^h f'(-s) (-ds) = -∫₀^h f'(-s) ds. Therefore, f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) = ∫₀^h f'(t) dt - ∫₀^h f'(-s) ds = ∫₀^h [f'(t) - f'(-t)] dt

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = (1/h²) ∫₀^h [f'(t) - f'(-t)] dt

Now, evaluate this integral. Let's consider the integrand [f'(t) - f'(-t)]. Since f''(0) exists, we can approximate f'(t) and f'(-t) around 0.

Using the expansion f'(t) = f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t). Similarly, f'(-t) = f'(0) - f''(0)t + o(t). Therefore, f'(t) - f'(-t) = 2f''(0)t + o(t). Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫₀^h [2f''(0)t + o(t)] dt = 2f''(0) ∫₀^h t dt + ∫₀^h o(t) dt = 2f''(0) (h²/2) + o(h²) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = (f''(0)h² + o(h²)) / h² = f''(0) + o(1), which tends to f''(0) as h → 0. Therefore, this confirms the result.

This approach uses the integral of the difference between f'(t) and f'(-t), approximates the integrand using the given second derivative, and then evaluates the integral. This avoids using Taylor series directly and instead relies on the Mean Value Theorem and properties of integrals.

Another way is to use the definition of the second derivative and the symmetric difference quotient. The symmetric difference quotient for the second derivative is given by [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². If f is twice differentiable at 0, then this quotient approaches f''(0) as h → 0. This is a standard result in calculus, often used to approximate the second derivative numerically. Therefore, by the definition of the second derivative, the limit is f''(0).

But since the problem states not to use L'Hospital's rule, but this approach doesn't use it. Instead, it uses the definition of the second derivative via the symmetric difference quotient, which is valid if the second derivative exists.

Therefore, the key steps are either:

1. Use Taylor expansion with the Peano remainder term, expand f(h) and f(-h), subtract 2f(0), and take the limit.

2. Use the integral approach, express the difference f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) as the integral of the difference of f' and f'(-t), approximate the integrand using the second derivative, and evaluate the integral.

Both methods lead to the conclusion that the limit is f''(0).

To summarize, since f''(0) exists, the function f is twice differentiable at 0, allowing us to expand f(h) and f(-h) using the second-order Taylor series. Subtracting 2f(0) eliminates the linear terms in h, leaving the quadratic term involving f''(0). Dividing by h² and taking the limit as h approaches 0 then yields f''(0). This avoids the use of L'Hospital's rule and instead relies on the properties of differentiability and Taylor expansions.

","Okay, so I need to show that if a function f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). The problem says not to use L'Hospital's rule, so I need to find another way to approach this. Hmm, maybe using Taylor expansions or the definition of the derivative?

First, let me recall that if a function is twice differentiable at a point, then it can be expressed using a Taylor series expansion around that point. Since we're dealing with h approaching 0, expanding around 0 makes sense. The usual Taylor expansion for f(h) around 0 is f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Similarly, for f(-h), it should be f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Let me write that down:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Now, if I subtract 2f(0) from both sides and add the two equations together, maybe things will cancel out. Let's see:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) - 2f(0) + f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Simplifying the right-hand side:

First, f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) = 0

Then, f'(0)h - f'(0)h = 0

Then, (1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² = f''(0)h²

And the o(h²) terms from both expansions are also present. So altogether:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, dividing both sides by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

Now, as h approaches 0, the term o(h²)/h² goes to 0 because o(h²) represents a function that goes to 0 faster than h² does. Therefore, the limit as h approaches 0 of the left-hand side is just f''(0). That seems straightforward. But wait, the problem states that f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Does this guarantee that the Taylor expansion up to the second term is valid?

Wait, the Taylor expansion with the Peano remainder requires that f is twice differentiable at 0. However, if f is only differentiable and the second derivative exists at 0, does that mean the Taylor expansion up to the second term is valid? Hmm, maybe. The existence of the second derivative at 0 implies that the function can be approximated by the quadratic term. Let me think. The standard Taylor expansion with remainder is typically stated under the assumption that the function is twice differentiable in a neighborhood of the point, not just at the point. But here, we have f''(0) exists, but maybe not in a neighborhood. However, the problem says f is differentiable and f''(0) exists. Maybe the differentiability is sufficient?

Wait, actually, the differentiability is given, and the existence of the second derivative at 0. So perhaps the expansion I used is valid here. Alternatively, maybe we can use the definition of the second derivative.

Recall that the second derivative at 0 is defined as the limit of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h as h approaches 0. But how does that help here?

Alternatively, maybe using the definition of the first derivative. Let's see. If we consider the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let me try to express this in terms of derivatives.

First, note that f(h) - f(0) ≈ f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² as h approaches 0. Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) ≈ -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h². So adding these two:

[f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)] ≈ 2*(1/2)f''(0)h² = f''(0)h²

Therefore, f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0) ≈ f''(0)h², so [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² ≈ f''(0). Hence, the limit is f''(0). But is this rigorous?

Alternatively, maybe use the definition of the second derivative. Let's see. The second derivative at 0 can be written as the limit of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h as h approaches 0. But how does that connect to our expression?

Alternatively, consider expanding the numerator using the first derivative. Let's write f(h) = f(0) + h f'(0) + (1/2) h² f''(0) + o(h²), as I did before. Similarly for f(-h). Then subtract 2f(0), add f(-h). The cross terms cancel, and we get the result. But is there a way to do this without assuming the Taylor expansion?

Wait, maybe using the Mean Value Theorem. Let me think. If I consider the difference f(h) - f(0), by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists c in (0, h) such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c)h. Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) = f'(d)(-h) where d is in (-h, 0). But then, how do these relate to the second derivative?

Alternatively, consider the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Let's write this as [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h². Then, factor out 1/h². Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Wait, perhaps use the definition of the first derivative. Let me denote f'(0) as the derivative at 0. Then, for small h, f(h) ≈ f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h². Similarly, f(-h) ≈ f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h². Then subtract 2f(0) and add f(-h). The f'(0)h terms cancel, and we get (f''(0)h²)/h² = f''(0). But again, this is the same as the Taylor expansion approach. Is this rigorous enough?

Wait, but how do we know that the remainder term is o(h²)? If the second derivative exists at 0, then the remainder term should be o(h²). Let me recall that if f''(0) exists, then f'(x) = f'(0) + f''(0)(x - 0) + o(|x - 0|). Wait, is that correct? Wait, the derivative f'(x) can be approximated by its value at 0 plus the derivative at 0 times (x - 0) plus a remainder term. But if we integrate that, we get f(x) - f(0) = ∫₀^x f'(t) dt ≈ ∫₀^x [f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t)] dt = f'(0)x + (1/2)f''(0)x² + o(x²). So yes, that gives the Taylor expansion with the remainder term as o(x²). Therefore, the expansion is valid here.

Therefore, the approach using Taylor expansion is correct. Hence, the limit is f''(0). Therefore, the answer is f''(0).

Wait, but let me check if there is an alternative approach without using Taylor series. Suppose we use the definition of the derivative. Let me think. Let's consider the expression:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h²

Let me denote this as A. Let me try to write A as [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h². Then, perhaps express each term in terms of the derivative.

But [f(h) - f(0)] / h² = ([f(h) - f(0)] / h) * (1 / h). Similarly for the other term. But [f(h) - f(0)] / h is the difference quotient for the derivative at 0, which approaches f'(0) as h approaches 0. However, multiplying by 1/h gives us something like f'(0)/h, which would go to infinity unless f'(0) is 0. But the second derivative is involved here, so maybe this approach isn't helpful.

Alternatively, consider expanding f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h). Let me write this as [f(h) - f(0)] - [f(0) - f(-h)]. Then, using the Mean Value Theorem on both differences.

For f(h) - f(0), there exists c in (0, h) such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c)h. Similarly, for f(0) - f(-h), there exists d in (-h, 0) such that f(0) - f(-h) = f'(d)h. Therefore, the numerator becomes f'(c)h - f'(d)h = h(f'(c) - f'(d)). Therefore, A = h(f'(c) - f'(d)) / h² = (f'(c) - f'(d)) / h.

Now, as h approaches 0, both c and d approach 0. So, if f' is differentiable at 0 (since f''(0) exists), then f'(c) - f'(d) can be approximated by f''(0)(c - d). Wait, is that right? Let's see. If f' is differentiable at 0, then f'(x) = f'(0) + f''(0)x + o(x). Therefore, f'(c) - f'(d) = [f'(0) + f''(0)c + o(c)] - [f'(0) + f''(0)d + o(d)] = f''(0)(c - d) + o(c) - o(d). Since c and d are both approaching 0, o(c) and o(d) are terms that go to 0 faster than c and d, respectively. So, f'(c) - f'(d) ≈ f''(0)(c - d). Therefore, A ≈ [f''(0)(c - d)] / h. But how does c - d relate to h?

Since c is in (0, h) and d is in (-h, 0), let's say c = h - ε and d = -h + δ for some small ε, δ approaching 0 as h approaches 0. But this might complicate things. Alternatively, note that c and d are both approaching 0, and since c is in (0, h) and d is in (-h, 0), then c - d ≈ 2h when h is approaching 0? Wait, maybe not. Let's think. If c is close to h and d is close to -h, then c - d ≈ h - (-h) = 2h. However, in reality, c and d are approaching 0, so c - d approaches 0. Hmm, maybe this approach is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, since f' is differentiable at 0, we can write f'(c) - f'(d) = f''(0)(c - d) + o(|c - d|). Therefore, A = [f''(0)(c - d) + o(|c - d|)] / h. But since c and d are between -h and h, |c - d| ≤ 2h. Therefore, o(|c - d|) is o(h). So, A = f''(0)(c - d)/h + o(h)/h = f''(0)(c - d)/h + o(1). Now, we need to evaluate the limit as h approaches 0 of this expression. If we can show that (c - d)/h approaches 1, then the limit would be f''(0). But how?

Wait, c is in (0, h) and d is in (-h, 0). Let me take c = h - ε and d = -h + δ, but this might not be the right approach. Alternatively, consider that c and d are arbitrary points approaching 0 as h approaches 0. However, in the Mean Value Theorem, the points c and d depend on h. So, as h approaches 0, both c and d approach 0. Therefore, c - d approaches 0. So, (c - d)/h approaches 0. Wait, but then A would approach 0, which contradicts the desired result. That suggests that this approach might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use the Mean Value Theorem twice. Let's see. Let me consider the expression f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h). Let's denote this as A. Then, A = [f(h) - f(0)] - [f(0) - f(-h)]. For each of these differences, apply the Mean Value Theorem. So, for f(h) - f(0), there exists c in (0, h) such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c)h. Similarly, for f(0) - f(-h), there exists d in (-h, 0) such that f(0) - f(-h) = f'(d)h. Therefore, A = f'(c)h - f'(d)h = h(f'(c) - f'(d)).

Now, we have A = h(f'(c) - f'(d))/h² = (f'(c) - f'(d))/h. So, limit as h approaches 0 of (f'(c) - f'(d))/h = limit of [f'(c)/h - f'(d)/h]. But as h approaches 0, both c and d approach 0. So, f'(c) ≈ f'(0) + f''(0)c and f'(d) ≈ f'(0) + f''(0)d. Therefore, f'(c) - f'(d) ≈ f''(0)(c - d). Hence, A ≈ f''(0)(c - d)/h. But how does c - d relate to h?

Wait, c is in (0, h) and d is in (-h, 0). Let's take c = h - ε and d = -h + δ, where ε and δ are small as h approaches 0. Then, c - d = (h - ε) - (-h + δ) = 2h - ε - δ. Therefore, (c - d)/h ≈ 2 - (ε + δ)/h. But as h approaches 0, ε and δ also approach 0, but their ratio to h is unclear. Wait, maybe this approach is not helpful.

Alternatively, consider that since c and d are between -h and h, then c - d can be as large as 2h (when c = h and d = -h) or as small as 0 (if c = d = 0). But since c and d are specific points depending on h, maybe we can bound |c - d| ≤ 2h. Therefore, |A| = |f'(c) - f'(d)| / |h| ≤ |f'(c) - f'(d)| / |h|. Since f' is differentiable at 0, f'(x) = f'(0) + f''(0)x + o(x). Therefore, |f'(c) - f'(d)| ≤ |f''(0)||c - d| + |o(c) - o(d)|. The o(c) and o(d) terms can be made arbitrarily small as c and d approach 0. Therefore, |f'(c) - f'(d)| ≤ |f''(0)||c - d| + ε|h| for small h. Therefore, |A| ≤ |f''(0)||c - d| / |h| + ε. Since |c - d| ≤ 2h, then |A| ≤ 2|f''(0)| + ε. Taking the limit as h approaches 0, ε approaches 0, so the limit is ≤ 2|f''(0)|. But this doesn't help us get the exact value. Hmm, maybe this approach is not the right way.

Going back, the Taylor expansion approach seems more straightforward. Let me re-examine that. If f is twice differentiable at 0, then f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²). Adding these two gives:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

Taking the limit as h approaches 0, the o(h²)/h² term goes to 0, so the limit is f''(0). Therefore, this should be the correct approach.

But wait, is the existence of f''(0) sufficient for the Taylor expansion up to the second term? The standard Taylor expansion with Peano remainder requires that the function is twice differentiable in a neighborhood of the point, not just at the point. However, if the second derivative exists at the point, does that guarantee the expansion? Let me recall.

In some references, the Taylor expansion with the Peano remainder is stated as follows: If f is n times differentiable at a point x₀, then f(x) = f(x₀) + f'(x₀)(x - x₀) + ... + (f^{(n)}(x₀)/n!)(x - x₀)^n + o((x - x₀)^n). So, in this case, if f is twice differentiable at 0, then the expansion up to the second term is valid. Therefore, even if the second derivative doesn't exist in a neighborhood, as long as it exists at the point, the expansion holds. Therefore, this approach is valid.

Therefore, the limit is indeed f''(0). Hence, the answer is f''(0).

","Okay, so I need to show that if a function f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). And I can't use L'Hospital's rule. Hmm, let's think.

First, since f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, that means f is at least twice differentiable at 0. Maybe I can use the definition of the second derivative. The second derivative at 0 is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h, but I'm not sure how that connects to the given expression here.

Wait, the given expression is symmetric in h and -h. Let me write it out again: [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Hmm, that looks familiar. Isn't that similar to the second difference quotient? Yeah, for approximating the second derivative. So maybe I can expand f(h) and f(-h) using Taylor series or some sort of quadratic approximation.

But since f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, maybe I can use the Taylor expansion up to the second order. Let's recall that if f is twice differentiable at 0, then:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²),
and similarly,
f(-h) = f(0) + f'(-h)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Wait, but hold on, the expansion for f(-h) might not be exactly the same because the derivative at -h might be different from the derivative at 0. But since we're taking h approaching 0, f'(-h) should approach f'(0) as h approaches 0, right? Because f' is differentiable at 0, which means it's continuous there. So f'(-h) = f'(0) - f''(0)h + o(h). Let me check that.

If f' is differentiable at 0, then the derivative of f' at 0, which is f''(0), exists. So by the definition of the derivative,

f'(h) = f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h),
and similarly,
f'(-h) = f'(0) - f''(0)h + o(h).

Therefore, substituting back into the expansion of f(-h):

f(-h) = f(0) + f'(-h)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)² + o(h²),
Wait, no. Wait, the Taylor expansion of f around 0 is:

f(x) = f(0) + f'(0)x + (1/2)f''(0)x² + o(x²).

But if x = -h, then:

f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + (1/2)f''(0)(-h)² + o((-h)^2).
Simplify that:

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Similarly, the expansion for f(h) is:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²).

So now, if I subtract 2f(0) and add f(-h) to f(h):

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Let's compute this step by step:

First, expand f(h):

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Then, adding f(h) + f(-h):

= [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Combine like terms:

= f(0) + f(0) + f'(0)h - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) + o(h²)

Simplify:

= 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Then, dividing by h²:

[f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h² = f''(0) + [o(h²)/h²]

Now, the term [o(h²)/h²] goes to 0 as h approaches 0, because o(h²) is a term that goes to zero faster than h². Therefore, the limit as h approaches 0 is f''(0). So the limit is indeed f''(0). That seems to work.

Wait, but let me check again. Did I use the fact that f''(0) exists correctly? Yes, because in the Taylor expansion, the coefficient of h² is (1/2)f''(0). So when I added f(h) and f(-h), the linear terms canceled out, and the quadratic terms added up. Then subtracting 2f(0) just leaves the quadratic term and the o(h²). Dividing by h² gives f''(0) plus something that goes to zero. Therefore, the limit is f''(0). That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using the definitions of derivatives without Taylor series. Let's try that method to verify.

We know that f''(0) exists, which is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. So f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h.

But how does this relate to the given expression? Let's see. The given expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h².

If I can express f(h) and f(-h) in terms of f'(0)h, maybe using the mean value theorem or some difference quotients.

Alternatively, note that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c)h for some c between 0 and h by the Mean Value Theorem. Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) = f'(d)(-h) for some d between -h and 0. But this might complicate things because c and d depend on h, and it's not clear how to combine them.

Alternatively, perhaps express f(h) as f(0) + f'(0)h + ε₁(h)h, where ε₁(h) → 0 as h → 0, by the definition of derivative. Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) + f'(0)(-h) + ε₂(h)(-h), where ε₂(h) → 0 as h → 0.

But wait, if f is differentiable at 0, then f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h). So f(h) - f(0) = f'(0)h + o(h). Similarly, f(-h) - f(0) = -f'(0)h + o(h). Therefore, f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + o(h)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + o(h)] = [f(0) - f(0)] + [f'(0)h - f'(0)h] + [o(h) + o(h)] = o(h). But this seems contradictory because if we divide by h², we get o(h)/h² = o(1/h), which would go to infinity, but that's not the case here. So clearly, this approach is missing something.

Ah, wait, perhaps because f''(0) exists, we can get a better approximation. Since f''(0) exists, the derivative f'(h) can be approximated as f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Therefore, maybe f(h) can be approximated by integrating f'(h):

f(h) = f(0) + ∫₀^h f'(t) dt = f(0) + ∫₀^h [f'(0) + f''(0)t + o(t)] dt = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Similarly, f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Therefore, adding these two:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Dividing by h²:

[f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h² = f''(0) + o(1) → f''(0) as h → 0.

So this method also works. Therefore, regardless of whether I use the Taylor expansion or the integral of the derivative with its expansion, I end up with the same result. Thus, the limit is indeed f''(0).

Another approach: use the definition of the second derivative. Let me recall that the second derivative can be defined using the limit:

f''(0) = lim_{h→0} [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h.

But how does this relate to the given expression? Let's see. If I can express the given limit in terms of f'(h) and f'(-h), maybe.

Given that f is differentiable at 0 and f''(0) exists, then f is twice differentiable at 0. Let's denote f'(h) = f'(0) + f''(0)h + o(h). Similarly, f'(-h) = f'(0) - f''(0)h + o(h).

But then, how does this help with the original expression? The original expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h².

Wait, perhaps if I consider the difference f(h) - f(0) and f(-h) - f(0), and then combine them. Let me write:

[f(h) - f(0)] = f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²),
[f(-h) - f(0)] = -f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Adding these two equations:

[f(h) - f(0)] + [f(-h) - f(0)] = [f'(0)h - f'(0)h] + [ (1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² ] + o(h²) + o(h²)
= 0 + f''(0)h² + o(h²).

Therefore, [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] = f''(0)h² + o(h²), which gives the same result as before. Therefore, dividing by h² and taking the limit gives f''(0).

So regardless of the method—whether using Taylor expansions, integrating the derivative, or combining the differences—the result is the same.

I think this is solid. The key idea is that the symmetric difference quotient [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² eliminates the first derivative terms (since h and -h terms cancel) and leaves the second derivative term. Since we know f''(0) exists, the limit is just f''(0). The o(h²) terms vanish when divided by h² and taking the limit. Therefore, the proof is complete.

","Okay, so I need to show that if a function f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, then the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] divided by h squared equals f''(0). And I can't use L'Hospital's rule. Hmm, let's think about this step by step.

First, since f is differentiable and f''(0) exists, that means f is twice differentiable at 0. So, we can use Taylor expansions or maybe some form of the Mean Value Theorem here. The expression given in the limit looks like the central difference formula for the second derivative. I remember that the second derivative can be approximated by [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h², which is exactly the expression here. So, if the function is twice differentiable, this should approach f''(0) as h goes to 0.

But I need to prove this without using L'Hospital's rule. Let me recall the definitions of the first and second derivatives. The first derivative f'(x) is the limit as h approaches 0 of [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h. The second derivative f''(x) is the derivative of f'(x), so it's the limit as h approaches 0 of [f'(x + h) - f'(x)] / h.

Since we're dealing with h approaching 0 from both sides (because of the -h term), maybe I can express f(h) and f(-h) using the Taylor series expansion around 0 up to the second order term. That would include the first and second derivatives. Let me try that.

The Taylor expansion of f(h) around 0 is:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Similarly, for f(-h):

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Here, o(h²) represents the higher-order terms that go to zero faster than h² as h approaches 0.

Now, let's compute the numerator: f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)

Substituting the expansions:

= [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Let me simplify term by term:

First, f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Second, -2f(0) is straightforward.

Third, f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Adding them together:

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] - 2f(0) + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

Now, let's combine like terms:

f(0) - 2f(0) + f(0) = 0

f'(0)h - f'(0)h = 0

(1/2)f''(0)h² + (1/2)f''(0)h² = f''(0)h²

o(h²) + o(h²) = o(h²)

So, the numerator simplifies to f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Therefore, the expression becomes:

[f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, the term o(h²)/h² goes to 0, so the limit is f''(0). That seems straightforward. But wait, I should make sure that the Taylor expansion is valid here. Since f is twice differentiable at 0, the expansion up to the second term is correct. The o(h²) terms account for the higher-order terms that vanish faster than h². Therefore, the proof should hold.

Alternatively, if I didn't use Taylor expansion, maybe I can use the Mean Value Theorem. Let's see. Let's consider the difference f(h) - f(0) and f(0) - f(-h). Since f is differentiable, by the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a c1 in (0, h) such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c1)h, and there exists a c2 in (-h, 0) such that f(0) - f(-h) = f'(c2)h. But then, combining these, we get f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = [f'(c1) - f'(c2)]h. However, this seems to lead to a first derivative term, which might not directly help with the second derivative. Maybe I need to go further.

Alternatively, to get the second derivative, perhaps apply the Mean Value Theorem to the first derivatives. So, starting with f'(c1) - f'(c2) over h. If I set c1 = h - t and c2 = -h + t for some t, but this might complicate things. Maybe instead, use the definition of the second derivative as the limit of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h. But since we need to relate this to the given expression, perhaps this approach is more involved.

Let me think. The given expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². If I denote this as L, then L = [f(h) + f(-h) - 2f(0)] / h². If I rearrange the terms, it's like [f(h) - f(0) + f(-h) - f(0)] / h². Which can be written as [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h². Wait, but [f(-h) - f(0)] / h² is the same as [f(-h) - f(0)] / (-h)^2 times (-1)^2, which is [f(-h) - f(0)] / h². So, both terms are similar. So, L = [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h².

But each of these terms is like [f(h) - f(0)] / h². If I consider the first derivative, [f(h) - f(0)] / h approaches f'(0), but here we have h squared in the denominator, so it's like [f'(c1) - f'(0)] / h, using the Mean Value Theorem. Wait, maybe.

Let me try that. Let's take [f(h) - f(0)] / h². By the Mean Value Theorem, there exists a c1 in (0, h) such that f(h) - f(0) = f'(c1)h. Therefore, [f(h) - f(0)] / h² = f'(c1) / h. Similarly, [f(-h) - f(0)] / h² = [ - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h² ] = - [f'(c2) / h], where c2 is in (-h, 0) such that f(0) - f(-h) = f'(c2)h.

Therefore, L = [f'(c1)/h - f'(c2)/h] = [f'(c1) - f'(c2)] / h. Now, if I can express c1 and c2 in terms of h. Since c1 is between 0 and h, and c2 is between -h and 0, let's set c1 = h - t and c2 = -h + t for some t. Wait, but maybe this complicates things. Alternatively, note that as h approaches 0, c1 approaches 0 and c2 approaches 0 as well. So, since f''(0) exists, the difference f'(c1) - f'(c2) can be approximated by f''(0)(c1 - c2). But c1 - c2 is approximately h - (-h) = 2h. Wait, but c1 is in (0, h) and c2 is in (-h, 0), so c1 - c2 is between h - (-h) = 2h and h - 0 = h. Hmm, not sure.

Alternatively, since c1 approaches 0 and c2 approaches 0, then f'(c1) - f'(c2) = [f'(c1) - f'(0)] + [f'(0) - f'(c2)]. Then, [f'(c1) - f'(0)] / h = [f'(c1) - f'(0)] / h. Similarly, [f'(0) - f'(c2)] / h. As h approaches 0, c1 approaches 0, so [f'(c1) - f'(0)] / h = [f'(c1) - f'(0)] / h. Let's set c1 = 0 + h1, where h1 is between 0 and h. Then, [f'(h1) - f'(0)] / h1 * h1 / h. Since h1 is approaching 0, [f'(h1) - f'(0)] / h1 approaches f''(0), so this term becomes f''(0) * h1 / h. Similarly, for the other term [f'(0) - f'(c2)] / h, where c2 = -h + h2, so h2 is between 0 and h. Then, [f'(0) - f'(-h + h2)] / h = [f'(-h + h2) - f'(0)] / h = [f'(-h + h2) - f'(0)] / h. Let me write this as [f'(c2) - f'(0)] / h where c2 = -h + h2. Then, similar to the previous term, this would be approximately f''(0) * h2 / h. But h1 and h2 are both between 0 and h, so h1 / h and h2 / h are terms between 0 and 1. However, this approach seems to lead to terms that might not necessarily sum up to f''(0). Maybe this is not the right path.

Alternatively, perhaps consider expanding f(h) and f(-h) using the first-order terms and then the second-order term. Wait, but that's essentially the Taylor expansion approach, which we already did earlier. Since I already have a proof using Taylor expansion, maybe that's the way to go. The key point is that when expanding f(h) and f(-h) around 0 up to the second derivative, the first-order terms cancel out, leaving the second derivative term multiplied by h², and the rest are higher-order terms. Therefore, when divided by h², the limit becomes f''(0) plus terms that vanish as h approaches 0.

But let me verify once more. Let's write out the expansions again:

f(h) = f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

f(-h) = f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Adding these two:

f(h) + f(-h) = 2f(0) + 2*(1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) + o(h²)

Wait, actually, the f'(0)h terms cancel out:

f(h) + f(-h) = [f(0) + f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)] + [f(0) - f'(0)h + (1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²)]

= 2f(0) + (1/2 + 1/2)f''(0)h² + o(h²) + o(h²)

= 2f(0) + f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Then, subtracting 2f(0):

f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h) = f''(0)h² + o(h²)

Dividing by h²:

[f''(0)h² + o(h²)] / h² = f''(0) + o(h²)/h²

As h approaches 0, the o(h²)/h² term goes to 0, so the limit is f''(0). Therefore, this seems to confirm the result.

But let me check if there's another way, perhaps using the definition of the second derivative without Taylor series. Suppose we start with the definition of the first derivative:

f'(x) = lim_{h→0} [f(x + h) - f(x)] / h

Then, the second derivative is the derivative of f', so:

f''(x) = lim_{h→0} [f'(x + h) - f'(x)] / h

But how does this relate to the given expression? Let's see. The given expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². If I rearrange the terms, it's [f(h) - f(0) + f(-h) - f(0)] / h². Which is like [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h².

But [f(h) - f(0)] / h is f'(c1) by the Mean Value Theorem, so [f(h) - f(0)] / h² = f'(c1)/h. Similarly, [f(-h) - f(0)] / h² = - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h² = -f'(c2)/h, where c2 is in (-h, 0). So then, the entire expression becomes [f'(c1) - f'(c2)] / h.

Now, since c1 is between 0 and h, c1 approaches 0 as h approaches 0. Similarly, c2 is between -h and 0, so c2 approaches 0 as h approaches 0. Therefore, we can write:

f'(c1) - f'(c2) = [f'(c1) - f'(0)] + [f'(0) - f'(c2)]

Then, [f'(c1) - f'(c2)] / h = [f'(c1) - f'(0)] / h + [f'(0) - f'(c2)] / h

For the first term, [f'(c1) - f'(0)] / h. Let me write c1 = 0 + h1, where h1 is between 0 and h. Then, the term becomes [f'(h1) - f'(0)] / h1 * h1 / h. As h approaches 0, h1 approaches 0, so [f'(h1) - f'(0)] / h1 approaches f''(0). Therefore, the first term is approximately f''(0) * h1 / h. Similarly, for the second term, [f'(0) - f'(c2)] / h. Let me write c2 = -h + h2, where h2 is between 0 and h. Then, [f'(0) - f'(-h + h2)] / h = [f'(-h + h2) - f'(0)] / (-h + h2) * (-h + h2) / h. As h approaches 0, -h + h2 approaches 0, so [f'(-h + h2) - f'(0)] / (-h + h2) approaches f''(0). Therefore, the second term is approximately f''(0) * (-h + h2) / h. But h2 is between 0 and h, so (-h + h2) is between -h and 0. Therefore, (-h + h2)/h is between -1 and 0. However, as h approaches 0, h2 approaches 0 as well, so (-h + h2) approaches -h. Therefore, the second term becomes approximately f''(0) * (-h)/h = -f''(0). But that can't be right, since we have two terms, each approximating f''(0) times something.

Wait, this seems a bit messy. Let's try to formalize it. Let's denote c1 and c2 as points in (0, h) and (-h, 0) respectively such that:

f(h) - f(0) = f'(c1)h

f(0) - f(-h) = f'(c2)h

Then, the expression [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h² = [f'(c1)h - f'(c2)h] / h² = [f'(c1) - f'(c2)] / h

Now, since c1 and c2 approach 0 as h approaches 0, we can write f'(c1) - f'(c2) = [f'(c1) - f'(0)] + [f'(0) - f'(c2)] = f'(c1) - f'(0) + f'(0) - f'(c2)

Therefore, [f'(c1) - f'(c2)] / h = [f'(c1) - f'(0)] / h + [f'(0) - f'(c2)] / h

Now, let's consider the first term: [f'(c1) - f'(0)] / h. Let's set c1 = 0 + h1, where h1 is in (0, h). Then, f'(c1) - f'(0) = f'(h1) - f'(0) = f''(0)h1 + o(h1). Therefore, [f'(h1) - f'(0)] / h = [f''(0)h1 + o(h1)] / h = f''(0)(h1 / h) + o(h1)/h. As h approaches 0, h1 approaches 0, so h1/h is between 0 and 1. However, since h1 is in (0, h), h1/h is less than 1, but as h approaches 0, h1 can be as small as we want relative to h. Wait, but actually, the Mean Value Theorem gives us that c1 is in (0, h), so h1 is between 0 and h. Therefore, h1/h is between 0 and 1. However, when taking the limit as h approaches 0, the term h1/h could be any value between 0 and 1, but we need to find the limit. Similarly, for the second term.

Similarly, for the second term: [f'(0) - f'(c2)] / h. Let c2 = 0 - h2, where h2 is in (0, h). Then, f'(c2) = f'(-h2) = f'(0) - f''(0)h2 + o(h2). Therefore, f'(0) - f'(c2) = f''(0)h2 + o(h2). Then, [f'(0) - f'(c2)] / h = [f''(0)h2 + o(h2)] / h = f''(0)(h2 / h) + o(h2)/h. Again, h2 is in (0, h), so h2/h is between 0 and 1.

Therefore, combining both terms:

[f'(c1) - f'(c2)] / h = f''(0)(h1/h) + o(h1)/h + f''(0)(h2/h) + o(h2)/h

= f''(0)(h1 + h2)/h + [o(h1) + o(h2)]/h

But h1 + h2 is equal to h1 + h2. Wait, but c1 is in (0, h) and c2 is in (-h, 0). Let me see if there's a relationship between h1 and h2. Not directly, unless we relate them through the Mean Value Theorem. Wait, actually, since c1 and c2 are related through the original function's expansion, but I don't think there's a direct relationship. Therefore, h1 and h2 can vary independently as h approaches 0.

However, since h1 and h2 are both between 0 and h, h1 + h2 is less than 2h. Therefore, (h1 + h2)/h < 2. But as h approaches 0, h1 and h2 approach 0, so (h1 + h2)/h could be anything between 0 and 2. This seems problematic because then the limit would depend on how h1 and h2 behave as h approaches 0.

But this contradicts our initial intuition that the limit should be f''(0). Therefore, this approach might not be the right way, or perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, but maybe I can use the fact that both h1 and h2 approach 0 as h approaches 0, and the terms h1/h and h2/h are both approaching 0. For example, if h1 = o(h), then h1/h approaches 0. Similarly, if h2 = o(h), then h2/h approaches 0. However, in reality, h1 and h2 are not necessarily smaller than h. For example, in the Mean Value Theorem, c1 can be as close to h as possible, so h1 = h - c1, which can be very small. Wait, no, if c1 is in (0, h), then h1 = c1, so h1 can be as close to 0 as possible or as close to h as possible. Similarly for h2. Therefore, h1/h can be any value between 0 and 1, and similarly for h2/h.

This seems to complicate things, because then the terms h1/h and h2/h are not necessarily approaching 0. Therefore, this approach might not give us the desired result, unless we can bound h1 and h2 in some way.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that the difference quotient for the second derivative can be expressed as the limit of [f'(h) - f'(0)] / h, which by definition is f''(0). However, how does this relate to our original expression?

Wait, our original expression is [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². If I consider the expression [f(h) - f(0)] / h² + [f(-h) - f(0)] / h², which is the same as [f(h) - 2f(0) + f(-h)] / h². Each of these terms can be related to the second derivative.

Let me consider the first term: [f(h) - f(0)] / h². Using the Mean Value Theorem, we have f(h) - f(0) = f'(c)h for some c in (0, h). Therefore, [f(h) - f(0)] / h² = f'(c)/h. Similarly, [f(-h) - f(0)] / h² = [f(-h) - f(0)] / h² = - [f(0) - f(-h)] / h² = -f'(d)/h for some d in (-h, 0). Therefore, the entire expression is [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h.

Now, since c and d approach 0 as h approaches 0, we can expand f'(c) and f'(d) using the definition of the derivative. Specifically, f'(c) = f'(0) + f''(0)c + o(c), and f'(d) = f'(0) + f''(0)d + o(d). Therefore, f'(c) - f'(d) = f''(0)(c - d) + o(c) - o(d). Therefore, [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h = f''(0)(c - d)/h + [o(c) - o(d)] / h.

Now, we need to analyze the terms (c - d)/h and [o(c) - o(d)] / h as h approaches 0.

First, let's note that c is in (0, h) and d is in (-h, 0). Therefore, c - d is in ( -h, 2h ). However, the exact relationship between c and d is not clear. But perhaps we can express c and d in terms of h. Alternatively, notice that since c is in (0, h) and d is in (-h, 0), then c - d is between h - (-h) = 2h and h - 0 = h. Therefore, c - d is between h and 2h. Therefore, (c - d)/h is between 1 and 2. However, as h approaches 0, c and d approach 0, but (c - d)/h could be any value between 1 and 2. This seems problematic because then the term f''(0)(c - d)/h would depend on the ratio (c - d)/h, which isn't necessarily approaching any specific value. Therefore, this approach might not work.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Mean Value Theorem again on f' to get a better approximation. For example, [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h. Let's set c and d such that c = h - t and d = -h + t for some t between 0 and h. Then, c - d = 2h - 2t. But this seems arbitrary. Alternatively, perhaps consider that c and d are both approaching 0, so we can write f'(c) - f'(d) = f''(0)(c - d) + o(c - d). Then, [f'(c) - f'(d)] / h = f''(0)(c - d)/h + o(c - d)/h.

But since c - d is between h and 2h, then (c - d)/h is between 1 and 2, so the term f''(0)(c - d)/h would be between f''(0) and 2f''(0). However, this contradicts the desired result of f''(0). Therefore, this approach might not be the right way.

Given that the Taylor series approach gives the correct result and is straightforward, and the Mean Value Theorem approach is leading me into a more complicated territory without a clear path to the solution, I think the Taylor series approach is the way to go here.

Therefore, the key steps are:

1. Expand f(h) and f(-h) using Taylor's theorem up to the second derivative term.
2. Subtract 2f(0) from the sum of the two expansions.
3. Notice that the first-order terms cancel out.
4. Divide by h² and take the limit as h approaches 0.
5. The result is f''(0), as the higher-order terms vanish.

This seems solid and avoids the need for L'Hospital's rule, which is the constraint given in the problem. Therefore, the proof is complete.

To find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\), we need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

1. **Using Euler's Theorem**:
   - Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). For \\(n = 100\\), \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\).
   - Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). We need to reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\).

2. **Reducing the exponent modulo 40**:
   - Compute \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\).
   - Euler's theorem gives \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). We need to reduce \\(2014 \\mod 16\\).
   - \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\), so we need \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\).
   - Observing \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), we get \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 \\cdot 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod 40\\).

3. **Final computation modulo 100**:
   - Now compute \\(3^9 \\mod 100\\).
   - Calculate step-by-step: \\(3^1 = 3\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(3^4 = 81\\), \\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\), \\(3^6 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\), \\(3^7 = 87\\), \\(3^8 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\), \\(3^9 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\).

4. **Verification using Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
   - Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\).
   - Modulo 4: \\(3 \\equiv -1 \\mod 4\\), so \\(3^{\\text{odd}} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\).
   - Modulo 25: Compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\) (since \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\)), then \\(3^{2014} \\mod 8 = 6\\), so \\(3^6 \\mod 20 = 9\\). Then \\(3^9 \\mod 25 = 8\\).
   - Combine results using Chinese Remainder Theorem: \\(x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) and \\(x \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\) gives \\(x = 83 \\mod 100\\).

Thus, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\(\\boxed{83}\\).

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, so I need to find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\). Hmm, that seems like a big exponent. Let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that to find the last two digits of a number, we can compute it modulo 100. So essentially, I need to calculate \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

But the exponent here is \\(3^{2014}\\), which is an enormous number. Calculating that directly is impossible, so I need a smarter way. Maybe Euler's theorem can help here. Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). 

Since 3 and 100 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), Euler's theorem should apply. Let me compute \\(\\phi(100)\\). The prime factorization of 100 is \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\), so \\(\\phi(100) = 100 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 100 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 40\\). 

Therefore, Euler's theorem tells us that \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). That means \\(3^k \\mod 100\\) repeats every 40 exponents. So, to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\), we can reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014}\\) modulo 40. 

So now the problem reduces to finding \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). Let me work on that. Again, maybe Euler's theorem can help here as well. Let's check if 3 and 40 are coprime. Since 3 is prime and doesn't divide 40, they are coprime. 

Compute \\(\\phi(40)\\). The prime factorization of 40 is \\(2^3 \\times 5\\), so \\(\\phi(40) = 40 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 40 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 16\\). 

Therefore, Euler's theorem tells us that \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Thus, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\) can be found by reducing 2014 modulo 16. Let's compute \\(2014 \\div 16\\). 

Dividing 2014 by 16: 16*125 = 2000, so 2014 - 2000 = 14. Therefore, 2014 mod 16 is 14. So, \\(3^{2014} \\equiv 3^{14} \\mod 40\\). 

Now, compute \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). Let's compute step by step:

- \\(3^1 = 3 \\mod 40\\)
- \\(3^2 = 9 \\mod 40\\)
- \\(3^3 = 27 \\mod 40\\)
- \\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 40 = 1 \\mod 40\\) (since 81 - 2*40 = 1)
- \\(3^5 = 3^4 * 3 = 1 * 3 = 3 \\mod 40\\)
- \\(3^6 = 3^5 * 3 = 3 * 3 = 9 \\mod 40\\)
- \\(3^7 = 9 * 3 = 27 \\mod 40\\)
- \\(3^8 = 27 * 3 = 81 \\mod 40 = 1 \\mod 40\\)
  
Wait, I notice a pattern here. Starting from \\(3^4\\), it cycles every 3 exponents: 1, 3, 9, 27, 1, 3, etc. So the cycle length is 3. Let's verify:

- \\(3^4 = 1\\)
- \\(3^5 = 3\\)
- \\(3^6 = 9\\)
- \\(3^7 = 27\\)
- \\(3^8 = 1\\)
- Yes, the cycle is 1, 3, 9, 27, 1, 3, etc. So every 3 exponents starting at 4, it cycles.

But \\(3^{14}\\): 14 divided by 3 gives 4 with a remainder of 2. So starting from \\(3^4\\), the first term is 1 (at exponent 4), then 3 (exponent 5), 9 (exponent 6), 27 (7), 1 (8), etc. So exponent 14: 14 - 4 = 10 exponents after the start. 10 divided by 3 is 3 with remainder 1. So the position in the cycle is 1. Therefore, \\(3^{14} \\mod 40 = 3^1 = 3 \\mod 40\\). Wait, but let's check another way.

Alternatively, since \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), then \\(3^{14} = 3^{4*3 + 2} = (3^4)^3 * 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 * 9 = 9 \\mod 40\\). Wait, that contradicts my previous conclusion. Which is correct?

Wait, hold on. Let's compute \\(3^{14}\\) step by step properly:

Compute \\(3^1 = 3\\)

\\(3^2 = 9\\)

\\(3^3 = 27\\)

\\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 40 = 1\\)

\\(3^5 = 3\\)

\\(3^6 = 9\\)

\\(3^7 = 27\\)

\\(3^8 = 1\\)

\\(3^9 = 3\\)

\\(3^{10} = 9\\)

\\(3^{11} = 27\\)

\\(3^{12} = 1\\)

\\(3^{13} = 3\\)

\\(3^{14} = 9\\)

Wait, so according to this step-by-step calculation, \\(3^{14} \\mod 40 = 9\\). But earlier, when using the cycle approach, I thought it might be 3. So which is correct? Let's verify:

From exponent 4 onwards:

- \\(3^4 = 1\\)

- \\(3^5 = 3\\)

- \\(3^6 = 9\\)

- \\(3^7 = 27\\)

- \\(3^8 = 81 \\mod 40 = 1\\)

So the cycle is 1, 3, 9, 27, 1, 3, 9, 27,... So starting at exponent 4, each multiple of 3 exponents cycles back.

So exponent 14: 14 - 4 = 10 exponents after the start. 10 divided by 3 is 3 with remainder 1. So starting from exponent 4 (which is 1), adding 3*3=9 exponents brings us to exponent 4 + 9 = 13 (which is 1), then exponent 14 is the next one, which would be 3. But according to the step-by-step, exponent 14 is 9. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, maybe I messed up the cycle. Let's list them:

Exponent: 4 → 1

5 → 3

6 → 9

7 → 27

8 → 1

9 → 3

10 → 9

11 → 27

12 → 1

13 → 3

14 → 9

15 → 27

16 → 1

So indeed, exponent 14 is 9. Therefore, my initial step-by-step is correct, and the cycle approach had a mistake. The cycle length is 3, starting at exponent 4. So exponents 4,8,12,16,... are 1. Then 5,9,13,... are 3; 6,10,14,... are 9; 7,11,15,... are 27.

Therefore, exponent 14 is 9. Therefore, \\(3^{14} \\mod 40 = 9\\). So then, going back, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 9\\). Therefore, the original exponent \\(3^{2014}\\) is congruent to 9 modulo 40. Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^9 \\mod 100\\).

Wait, so now I need to compute \\(3^9 \\mod 100\\). Let's compute that:

- \\(3^1 = 3\\)

- \\(3^2 = 9\\)

- \\(3^3 = 27\\)

- \\(3^4 = 81\\)

- \\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\)

- \\(3^6 = 43 * 3 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\)

- \\(3^7 = 29 * 3 = 87\\)

- \\(3^8 = 87 * 3 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\)

- \\(3^9 = 61 * 3 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\)

So \\(3^9 \\mod 100 = 83\\). Therefore, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) should be 83. 

Wait, but let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, Euler's theorem applied to 100 gives \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\), so \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). Therefore, \\(3^{k} \\mod 100\\) cycles every 40. So the exponent \\(3^{2014}\\) needs to be reduced modulo 40. 

Then, for \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\), we use Euler's theorem again. \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\), so \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{2014 \\mod 16} \\mod 40\\). 

Calculating \\(2014 \\mod 16\\): 16*125=2000, 2014-2000=14, so 2014 mod 16=14. Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{14} \\mod 40\\). 

Calculating \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\) step by step:

- \\(3^1 = 3\\)

- \\(3^2 = 9\\)

- \\(3^3 = 27\\)

- \\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 40 = 1\\)

- \\(3^5 = 3\\)

- \\(3^6 = 9\\)

- \\(3^7 = 27\\)

- \\(3^8 = 1\\)

- \\(3^9 = 3\\)

- \\(3^{10} = 9\\)

- \\(3^{11} = 27\\)

- \\(3^{12} = 1\\)

- \\(3^{13} = 3\\)

- \\(3^{14} = 9\\)

Yes, so \\(3^{14} \\mod 40 = 9\\). Then, the original exponent is 9, so \\(3^9 \\mod 100 = 83\\). 

But let me verify once again. Maybe there's a mistake in the cycle calculation for \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). Alternatively, perhaps using another method. 

Alternatively, write \\(3^{14} = 3^{4 + 10} = 3^4 * 3^{10}\\). We know \\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 40 = 1\\). Then \\(3^{10} \\mod 40\\). 

Compute \\(3^{10} \\mod 40\\). Let's compute \\(3^1=3\\), \\(3^2=9\\), \\(3^3=27\\), \\(3^4=1\\), \\(3^5=3\\), \\(3^6=9\\), \\(3^7=27\\), \\(3^8=1\\), \\(3^9=3\\), \\(3^{10}=9\\). So \\(3^{10} \\mod 40 = 9\\). Therefore, \\(3^{14} = 1 * 9 = 9 \\mod 40\\). So that checks out. 

Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^9 \\mod 100 = 83\\). 

But let me check another way. Maybe using Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since 100 = 4*25, and 4 and 25 are coprime. So compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\), then combine the results. 

First, mod 4: 3 mod 4 is 3, and 3^1=3, 3^2=1, 3^3=3, 3^4=1, etc. So the cycle is 2. So exponent \\(3^{2014}\\) mod 2. Since 3 is odd, 3^{2014} is odd. Therefore, \\(3^{odd} \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\). So \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\). 

Next, mod 25: Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\). Euler's theorem: \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\). So 3 and 25 are coprime, so \\(3^{20} \\equiv 1 \\mod 25\\). Therefore, exponent \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\). 

Compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\). Again, Euler's theorem: \\(\\phi(20) = 8\\). So \\(3^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 20\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20 = 3^{2014 \\mod 8} \\mod 20\\). 

2014 divided by 8: 8*251=2008, remainder 6. So \\(3^6 \\mod 20\\). 

Compute \\(3^1=3\\), \\(3^2=9\\), \\(3^3=27 \\mod 20 =7\\), \\(3^4=21 \\mod 20=1\\), \\(3^5=3\\), \\(3^6=9\\). So \\(3^6 \\mod 20=9\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20=9\\). 

Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25 = 3^9 \\mod 25\\). Compute \\(3^9\\): 

- \\(3^1=3\\)

- \\(3^2=9\\)

- \\(3^3=27 \\mod 25=2\\)

- \\(3^4=6\\)

- \\(3^5=18\\)

- \\(3^6=54 \\mod 25=4\\)

- \\(3^7=12\\)

- \\(3^8=36 \\mod 25=11\\)

- \\(3^9=33 \\mod 25=8\\)

So \\(3^9 \\mod 25=8\\). 

Now, we have:

- \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\)

- \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\)

Now, find a number x such that x ≡ 3 mod 4 and x ≡ 8 mod 25. 

Let me solve the congruence:

x ≡ 8 mod 25. So x = 25k + 8 for some integer k.

Substitute into x ≡ 3 mod 4:

25k + 8 ≡ 3 mod 4

25 mod 4 = 1, 8 mod 4 = 0. So:

1*k + 0 ≡ 3 mod 4

k ≡ 3 mod 4

Therefore, k = 4m + 3 for some integer m.

Thus, x = 25*(4m +3) +8 = 100m +75 +8 = 100m +83.

Therefore, the smallest positive solution is 83 mod 100. So x ≡83 mod 100. 

Therefore, the last two digits are 83. 

This matches the previous result. So both methods give the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are 83.

**Final Answer**
The last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\boxed{83}.

To find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\), we need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

1. **Using Euler's Theorem**:
   - Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). For \\(n = 100\\), \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\).
   - Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). We need to reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\).

2. **Reducing the exponent modulo 40**:
   - Compute \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\).
   - Euler's theorem gives \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). We need to reduce \\(2014 \\mod 16\\).
   - \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\), so we need \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\).
   - Observing \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), we get \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 \\cdot 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod 40\\).

3. **Final computation modulo 100**:
   - Now compute \\(3^9 \\mod 100\\).
   - Calculate step-by-step: \\(3^1 = 3\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(3^4 = 81\\), \\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\), \\(3^6 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\), \\(3^7 = 87\\), \\(3^8 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\), \\(3^9 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\).

4. **Verification using Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
   - Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\).
   - Modulo 4: \\(3 \\equiv -1 \\mod 4\\), so \\(3^{\\text{odd}} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\).
   - Modulo 25: Compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\) (since \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\)), then \\(3^{2014} \\mod 8 = 6\\), so \\(3^6 \\mod 20 = 9\\). Then \\(3^9 \\mod 25 = 8\\).
   - Combine results using Chinese Remainder Theorem: \\(x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) and \\(x \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\) gives \\(x = 83 \\mod 100\\).

Thus, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\(\\boxed{83}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\). Hmm, that seems like a big exponent. I remember that to find the last two digits of a number, we can compute it modulo 100. So, essentially, I need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

But how do I handle such a huge exponent? Maybe Euler's theorem can help here. Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). Since 3 and 100 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), this theorem should apply. Let's compute \\(\\phi(100)\\). 

100 factors into \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\), so \\(\\phi(100) = 100 \\times (1 - 1/2) \\times (1 - 1/5) = 100 \\times 1/2 \\times 4/5 = 40\\). So, \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). That means \\(3^{k} \\mod 100\\) is equivalent to \\(3^{k \\mod 40} \\mod 100\\), right? 

Wait, actually, it's \\(3^{k} \\mod 100 = 3^{k \\mod \\phi(100)} \\mod 100\\), but only if \\(k\\) is a multiple of \\(\\phi(100)\\) in some way. Wait, no, Euler's theorem tells us that \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\), so \\(3^{k} \\equiv 3^{k \\mod 40} \\mod 100\\) only if \\(k\\) is a multiple of 40? Hmm, maybe not exactly. Let me think again. 

Actually, Euler's theorem gives that \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\), so the exponents can be reduced modulo 40. But if we have \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\), then we can write this as \\(3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 40)} \\mod 100\\). Wait, is that correct? Let me verify. 

Yes, because if \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\), then \\(a^k \\equiv a^{k \\mod \\phi(n)} \\mod n\\). But that's only when \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, which they are here. So, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\) is equivalent to \\(3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 40)} \\mod 100\\). Therefore, I need to compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\) first. 

Alright, so now the problem reduces to finding \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). Let's tackle this. Again, Euler's theorem might help here. Let's compute \\(\\phi(40)\\). 40 factors into \\(2^3 \\times 5\\), so \\(\\phi(40) = 40 \\times (1 - 1/2) \\times (1 - 1/5) = 40 \\times 1/2 \\times 4/5 = 16\\). Therefore, \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\). 

Since 3 and 40 are coprime, \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\) is equivalent to \\(3^{2014 \\mod 16} \\mod 40\\). Let's compute \\(2014 \\mod 16\\). 

Dividing 2014 by 16: 16*125 = 2000, so 2014 - 2000 = 14. Therefore, \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\). So, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{14} \\mod 40\\). 

Now, compute \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). Let's calculate step by step. 

\\(3^1 = 3 \\mod 40 = 3\\)

\\(3^2 = 9 \\mod 40 = 9\\)

\\(3^3 = 27 \\mod 40 = 27\\)

\\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 40 = 1\\)

Wait, \\(3^4 = 81\\), and 81 divided by 40 is 2 with remainder 1. So \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). That's interesting. Then, \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), so \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 \\times 3^2\\). 

Since \\(3^4 \\equiv 1\\), this becomes \\(1^3 \\times 9 = 9 \\mod 40\\). Wait, is that right? Let me check again. \\(3^4 = 81 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Then, \\(3^{14} = 3^{4*3 + 2} = (3^4)^3 * 3^2 = 1^3 * 9 = 9 \\mod 40\\). Yes, that seems correct. 

Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 9\\). So going back to the original problem, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^9 \\mod 100\\). 

Compute \\(3^9\\). Let's do that step by step:

\\(3^1 = 3\\)

\\(3^2 = 9\\)

\\(3^3 = 27\\)

\\(3^4 = 81\\)

\\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\)

\\(3^6 = 43 * 3 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\)

\\(3^7 = 29 * 3 = 87\\)

\\(3^8 = 87 * 3 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\)

\\(3^9 = 61 * 3 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\)

So, \\(3^9 \\mod 100 = 83\\). Therefore, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) should be 83. 

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

First, Euler's theorem applies because 3 and 100 are coprime. \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\), so \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 40)} \\mod 100\\). Then, computing \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). For that, \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\), so \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{(2014 \\mod 16)} \\mod 40\\). 

2014 divided by 16 is 125*16=2000, remainder 14. So 2014 mod 16 is 14. Then, \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). 

But earlier, I noticed that \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), so \\(3^{14} = 3^{4*3 + 2} = (1)^3 * 3^2 = 9 \\mod 40\\). That seems correct. Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 9\\). Then, \\(3^9 \\mod 100 = 83\\). 

But let me confirm this by another method. Sometimes, when dealing with exponents modulo something, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Let's try breaking down 100 into 4 and 25, since 4 and 25 are coprime. Then, compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\), then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. 

First, compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\). 

Since 3 ≡ -1 mod 4, so \\(3^{n} \\mod 4\\) is (-1)^n. Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4 = (-1)^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\). 

Now, 3^{2014} is an exponent. Since 3 is odd, 3^{2014} is odd^odd = odd. So, (-1)^{odd} = -1 mod 4. Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4 = -1 \\mod 4 = 3 mod 4\\). 

Next, compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\). 

To compute this, we can use Euler's theorem again. Since 3 and 25 are coprime, \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\). Therefore, \\(3^{20} ≡ 1 mod 25\\). Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 20)} \\mod 25\\). 

So now, we need to compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\). 

Compute \\(3^{2014} mod 20\\). 

Again, using Euler's theorem, since 3 and 20 are coprime, \\(\\phi(20) = 8\\). Therefore, \\(3^8 ≡ 1 mod 20\\). So, \\(3^{2014} mod 20 = 3^{(2014 mod 8)} mod 20\\). 

2014 divided by 8: 8*251=2008, remainder 6. So 2014 mod 8 = 6. Therefore, \\(3^6 mod 20\\). 

Compute \\(3^6\\): 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27≡7, 3^4=21≡1, 3^5=3, 3^6=9 mod 20. Wait, 3^4=81≡1 mod 20. Then 3^5=3^4*3≡1*3=3, 3^6=3^5*3=3*3=9 mod 20. So, 3^6 ≡9 mod 20. Therefore, \\(3^{2014} mod 20 =9\\). 

Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} mod 25 =3^9 mod 25\\). 

Compute 3^9 mod 25. Let's compute step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^3=27≡2

3^4=6

3^5=18

3^6=54≡4

3^7=12

3^8=36≡11

3^9=33≡8 mod 25

Wait, let's check that again:

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27 mod 25 = 2

3^4 = 3*2 = 6

3^5 = 3*6 = 18

3^6 = 3*18 = 54 mod 25 = 54 - 2*25 = 54 - 50 = 4

3^7 = 3*4 = 12

3^8 = 3*12 = 36 mod 25 = 36 - 25 = 11

3^9 = 3*11 = 33 mod 25 = 33 - 25 = 8

Yes, so 3^9 mod 25 =8. 

Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} ≡ 8 mod 25\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} ≡3 mod 4\\). 

Now, we need to find a number x such that:

x ≡ 3 mod 4

x ≡8 mod 25

So, solve the system of congruences. 

Let x =25k +8. Then, 25k +8 ≡3 mod4. 

25 mod4=1, so 25k +8 ≡k +0 mod4 (since 8 mod4=0). Therefore, k ≡3 mod4. 

Thus, k=4m +3. Therefore, x=25*(4m +3)+8=100m +75 +8=100m +83. 

Therefore, the smallest positive solution is x=83 mod100. 

Therefore, the last two digits are 83, which matches the previous result. 

So, both methods give the same answer. Therefore, I can be confident that the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are 83. 

But just to make sure, let me check with another approach. Maybe compute \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) modulo 100 directly using patterns in the powers of 3 modulo 100. 

The powers of 3 modulo 100 cycle every 20. Wait, is that true? Let me check:

Compute powers of 3 mod100:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^3=27

3^4=81

3^5=243≡43

3^6=43*3=129≡29

3^7=29*3=87

3^8=87*3=261≡61

3^9=61*3=183≡83

3^10=83*3=249≡49

3^11=49*3=147≡47

3^12=47*3=141≡41

3^13=41*3=123≡23

3^14=23*3=69

3^15=69*3=207≡7

3^16=7*3=21

3^17=21*3=63

3^18=63*3=189≡89

3^19=89*3=267≡67

3^20=67*3=201≡1 mod100? Wait, 67*3=201, which is 1 mod100. Wait, 3^20≡1 mod100? But earlier, using Euler's theorem, we saw that φ(100)=40, so 3^40≡1 mod100. But here, 3^20≡1 mod100? That seems conflicting. 

Wait, perhaps the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 100 is 20. Let me check 3^20 mod100. 

Compute 3^10 first: 3^10=59049. 59049 mod100=49. Then, 3^20=(3^10)^2=49^2=2401. 2401 mod100=1. Oh, so indeed, 3^20≡1 mod100. Therefore, the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 100 is 20, not 40. That's interesting. So, φ(100)=40, but the actual order is 20. Therefore, Euler's theorem gives an exponent that works, but the actual order is smaller. 

Therefore, in that case, when we have exponents of 3, we can reduce the exponent modulo 20 instead of 40. So, perhaps my initial approach was incorrect because I used φ(100)=40, but the actual order is 20. 

Wait, that's a problem. Let me check this again. 

If the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 100 is 20, then 3^20 ≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^k ≡3^{k mod20} mod100. Therefore, in order to compute 3^{3^{2014}} mod100, we need to compute 3^{2014} mod20, then take 3^{(3^{2014} mod20)} mod100. 

Wait, so my initial approach was wrong because I used φ(100)=40 instead of the actual multiplicative order. So, this changes things. 

Therefore, let's correct that. 

So, the correct approach would be:

Since 3^20 ≡1 mod100, then 3^{k} ≡3^{k mod20} mod100. Therefore, 3^{3^{2014}} ≡3^{(3^{2014} mod20)} mod100. 

Therefore, first compute 3^{2014} mod20. 

Compute 3^{2014} mod20. 

Again, using Euler's theorem: φ(20)=8, since 20=2^2*5, so φ(20)=20*(1-1/2)*(1-1/5)=20*1/2*4/5=8. Therefore, 3^8≡1 mod20. Therefore, 3^{2014} mod20=3^{2014 mod8} mod20. 

2014 divided by8: 8*251=2008, remainder6. So, 2014 mod8=6. Therefore, 3^6 mod20. 

Compute 3^6 mod20. 

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^3=27≡7

3^4=21≡1

3^5=3

3^6=9 mod20. 

Wait, 3^4=81≡1 mod20. Then, 3^5=3^4*3≡1*3=3, 3^6=3^5*3=3*3=9 mod20. So, 3^{2014} mod20=9. Therefore, 3^{3^{2014}} mod100=3^9 mod100=83. 

Wait, so even with the corrected multiplicative order, we still get 83. But that's the same result as before. So, maybe the initial approach was correct in terms of the answer, but the reasoning was a bit off because the actual order is 20, not 40. 

Therefore, even though I made a mistake in the initial step by using φ(100)=40, the answer still came out correct because 3^{2014} mod40 and 3^{2014} mod20 both gave exponents that led to the same result. 

But that seems coincidental. Let me check this again. 

Wait, if I use φ(100)=40, then 3^{3^{2014}} ≡3^{(3^{2014} mod40)} mod100. 

We computed 3^{2014} mod40=9. Then, 3^9 mod100=83. 

Alternatively, using φ(25)=20, and splitting into mod4 and mod25, we also got 83. 

But if I use the multiplicative order of 3 mod100 being 20, then 3^{3^{2014}} ≡3^{(3^{2014} mod20)} mod100=3^9=83. 

So, in both cases, the result is the same. Therefore, even though the reasoning was slightly different, the answer is correct. 

But why does this happen? Because 3^{20}≡1 mod100, and 3^{20}≡1 mod100 implies that 3^{k}≡3^{k mod20} mod100. Therefore, if we reduce the exponent modulo20, we get the correct result. 

But in the first approach, using φ(100)=40, we get 3^{3^{2014}} ≡3^{(3^{2014} mod40)} mod100. But since 3^{20}≡1 mod100, 3^{3^{2014}} ≡3^{(3^{2014} mod20)} mod100. Therefore, 3^{2014} mod40 and 3^{2014} mod20 must differ by a multiple of20. 

Indeed, 3^{2014} mod40=9 and 3^{2014} mod20=9. Therefore, both reduce to 9. Therefore, both methods give the same result. 

Therefore, even though the multiplicative order is 20, using φ(100)=40 still works because 3^{2014} mod40=9, which is congruent to 3^{2014} mod20=9. Therefore, 3^9 mod100=83. 

Thus, regardless of the method, the answer is 83. 

Therefore, after multiple checks and considering different approaches, I can confirm that the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are 83.

**Final Answer**
The last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\boxed{83}.

To find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\), we need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

1. **Using Euler's Theorem**:
   - Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). For \\(n = 100\\), \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\).
   - Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). We need to reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\).

2. **Reducing the exponent modulo 40**:
   - Compute \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\).
   - Euler's theorem gives \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). We need to reduce \\(2014 \\mod 16\\).
   - \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\), so we need \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\).
   - Observing \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), we get \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 \\cdot 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod 40\\).

3. **Final computation modulo 100**:
   - Now compute \\(3^9 \\mod 100\\).
   - Calculate step-by-step: \\(3^1 = 3\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(3^4 = 81\\), \\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\), \\(3^6 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\), \\(3^7 = 87\\), \\(3^8 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\), \\(3^9 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\).

4. **Verification using Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
   - Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\).
   - Modulo 4: \\(3 \\equiv -1 \\mod 4\\), so \\(3^{\\text{odd}} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\).
   - Modulo 25: Compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\) (since \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\)), then \\(3^{2014} \\mod 8 = 6\\), so \\(3^6 \\mod 20 = 9\\). Then \\(3^9 \\mod 25 = 8\\).
   - Combine results using Chinese Remainder Theorem: \\(x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) and \\(x \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\) gives \\(x = 83 \\mod 100\\).

Thus, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\(\\boxed{83}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\). Hmm, last two digits usually mean calculating modulo 100, right? So I need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). Let me think about how to approach this.

First, Euler's theorem comes to mind. Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). Here, 3 and 100 are coprime since gcd(3,100)=1. So I can use Euler's theorem here. The totient function \\(\\phi(100)\\) is needed. Since 100 factors into \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\), the totient is \\(100 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 100 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 40\\). So \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\).

That means \\(3^{k} \\mod 100\\) cycles every 40 exponents. So to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\), I can reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014}\\) modulo 40. In other words, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 40)} \\mod 100\\).

Wait, but I need to compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). Let's work on that. Again, using Euler's theorem here as well. For modulus 40, since 3 and 40 are coprime, \\(\\phi(40)\\) is needed. 40 factors into \\(2^3 \\times 5\\), so \\(\\phi(40) = 40 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 40 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 16\\). Therefore, \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\).

So \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{(2014 \\mod 16)} \\mod 40\\). Compute 2014 divided by 16. Let's see, 16*125=2000, so 2014-2000=14. So 2014 mod 16 is 14. Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{14} \\mod 40\\).

Now compute \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). Let's compute step by step:

\\(3^1 = 3 \\mod 40\\)

\\(3^2 = 9 \\mod 40\\)

\\(3^4 = (3^2)^2 = 9^2 = 81 \\mod 40 = 1\\)

Wait, \\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 40 = 81 - 2*40 = 1. So \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Then \\(3^{14} = 3^{4*3 + 2} = (3^4)^3 * 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 * 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod 40\\). So \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 9\\).

Therefore, going back to the original problem, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^9 \\mod 100\\). Compute \\(3^9\\):

\\(3^1 = 3\\)

\\(3^2 = 9\\)

\\(3^3 = 27\\)

\\(3^4 = 81\\)

\\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\)

\\(3^6 = 43*3 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\)

\\(3^7 = 29*3 = 87 \\mod 100 = 87\\)

\\(3^8 = 87*3 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\)

\\(3^9 = 61*3 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\)

So \\(3^9 \\mod 100 = 83\\). Therefore, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are 83. But wait, let me verify this step-by-step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First, Euler's theorem for modulus 100: \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\), so \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). Then exponent \\(3^{2014}\\) can be reduced modulo 40. To compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\), we use Euler's theorem again. \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\), so \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Then \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{(2014 \\mod 16)} \\mod 40\\). 2014 divided by 16: 16*125=2000, 2014-2000=14. So 3^14 mod 40. Then 3^4=81 mod 40=1, so 3^14=(3^4)^3 *3^2=1^3*9=9 mod40. Therefore, exponent is 9. Then 3^9=83 mod100. That seems correct.

But just to double-check, maybe there's an error in the step where I reduced \\(3^{2014}\\) mod 40. Let me recalculate that part.

Compute 2014 divided by 16:

16*125=2000, 2014-2000=14. So 2014=16*125+14. Therefore, 2014 mod16=14. Then 3^14 mod40. As above, since 3^4=81 mod40=1, so 3^14=3^(4*3 + 2)= (3^4)^3 *3^2=1^3*9=9 mod40. So that's correct.

Then 3^9 mod100: Let's compute 3^9 step by step again:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^3=27

3^4=81

3^5=3*81=243 mod100=43

3^6=3*43=129 mod100=29

3^7=3*29=87

3^8=3*87=261 mod100=61

3^9=3*61=183 mod100=83. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to compute 3^9:

3^5=243 mod100=43

Then 3^5=43, 3^6=43*3=129 mod100=29

3^7=29*3=87

3^8=87*3=261 mod100=61

3^9=61*3=183 mod100=83. Yep, same result.

So that seems solid. Therefore, the last two digits are 83. Wait, but let me check once more with another approach.

Alternatively, maybe using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since 100=4*25, and 4 and 25 are coprime. So compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\), then combine the results.

First, modulo 4: 3 mod4=3. So \\(3^k \\mod4\\). Since 3 mod4=3, 3^1=3 mod4, 3^2=1 mod4, then cycles every 2. So exponent \\(k=3^{2014}\\). So \\(3^{2014} \\mod2\\). Since 3 is odd, 3^{2014} is also odd. So 3^{2014} mod2=1. Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod4=3^1=3 mod4\\).

Now modulo25. Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod25\\). Euler's theorem here: \\(\\phi(25)=20\\), so \\(3^{20}\\equiv1 mod25\\). Therefore, exponent \\(3^{2014} mod20\\). Compute \\(3^{2014} mod20\\).

Again, \\(\\phi(20)=8\\), so \\(3^8≡1 mod20\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} mod8\\). Compute 2014 mod8. 2014 divided by8: 8*251=2008, 2014-2008=6. So 3^6 mod20. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27 mod20=7, 3^4=21 mod20=1, 3^5=3, 3^6=9 mod20. Therefore, 3^{2014} mod20=9. Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} mod25=3^9 mod25\\).

Compute 3^9 mod25:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^3=27 mod25=2

3^4=6

3^5=18

3^6=54 mod25=4

3^7=12

3^8=36 mod25=11

3^9=33 mod25=8

So 3^9 mod25=8. Therefore, the number is congruent to 3 mod4 and 8 mod25. Now find a number x such that x≡3 mod4 and x≡8 mod25.

Find x=25k+8. Then 25k+8≡3 mod4. 25 mod4=1, 8 mod4=0. So 1*k +0≡3 mod4 → k≡3 mod4. Therefore, k=4m+3. Then x=25*(4m+3)+8=100m+75+8=100m+83. Therefore, x≡83 mod100. So this confirms the previous result. Therefore, the last two digits are 83. So both methods agree.

Therefore, the answer should be 83. Wait, but let me check once again for any possible miscalculations.

First, using CRT: x≡3 mod4 and x≡8 mod25. Let's solve:

x ≡8 mod25. Let x=25k+8. Then 25k+8≡k +0 ≡k mod4. We need k≡3 mod4. So k=4m+3. Then x=25*(4m+3)+8=100m+75+8=100m+83. So indeed x≡83 mod100. So correct.

Alternatively, compute 3^9 mod100=83, and 83 mod4=1, but wait, 83 divided by4 is 20*4=80, remainder 3. So 83≡3 mod4. And 83≡8 mod25. So that's correct.

Therefore, all methods lead to 83. So I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\boxed{83}.

To find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\), we need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

1. **Using Euler's Theorem**:

2. **Reducing the exponent modulo 40**:
   - Compute \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\).
   - Euler's theorem gives \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). We need to reduce \\(2014 \\mod 16\\).
   - \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\), so we need \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\).
   - Observing \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), we get \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 \\cdot 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod 40\\).

3. **Final computation modulo 100**:
   - Now compute \\(3^9 \\mod 100\\).
   - Calculate step-by-step: \\(3^1 = 3\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(3^4 = 81\\), \\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\), \\(3^6 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\), \\(3^7 = 87\\), \\(3^8 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\), \\(3^9 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\).

4. **Verification using Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
   - Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\).

   - Combine results using Chinese Remainder Theorem: \\(x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) and \\(x \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\) gives \\(x = 83 \\mod 100\\).

Thus, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\(\\boxed{83}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\). Hmm, that's a pretty big exponent. I remember that to find the last two digits of a number, we can compute it modulo 100. So essentially, I need to calculate \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). But how do I handle such a huge exponent? Maybe Euler's theorem can help here. Let me think.

Euler's theorem states that if two numbers are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\), where \\(\\phi(n)\\) is Euler's totient function. Since 3 and 100 are coprime (they share no common factors besides 1), this should work. First, I need to compute \\(\\phi(100)\\). Let's calculate that.

100 can be factored into \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\), so \\(\\phi(100) = 100 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 100 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 100 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.8 = 40\\). So \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\). Therefore, according to Euler's theorem, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). That means \\(3^{k} \\mod 100\\) repeats every 40 exponents. So, to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\), I can reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014}\\) modulo 40 first, right?

Wait, so the exponent \\(3^{2014}\\) needs to be calculated modulo 40. Then, once I have \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\), say it's equal to some number m, then \\(3^m \\mod 100\\) will be the answer. But how do I compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\)?

Again, maybe Euler's theorem can help here. Let's compute \\(\\phi(40)\\). 40 factors into \\(2^3 \\times 5\\), so \\(\\phi(40) = 40 \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{2}) \\times (1 - \\frac{1}{5}) = 40 \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 40 \\times 0.5 \\times 0.8 = 16\\). So \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\). Therefore, \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). So, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\) can be reduced by taking 2014 modulo 16, right?

Wait, but hold on. Is 3 and 40 coprime? 3 and 40 share no common factors besides 1, so yes, they are coprime. Therefore, Euler's theorem applies. So \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\) is equal to \\(3^{2014 \\mod 16} \\mod 40\\). Let me compute 2014 divided by 16.

Calculating 2014 ÷ 16: 16 × 125 = 2000, so 2014 - 2000 = 14. So 2014 = 16 × 125 + 14, so 2014 mod 16 is 14. Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{14} \\mod 40\\).

Now, compute \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). Let's compute this step by step.

First, compute \\(3^1 = 3 \\mod 40\\)

\\(3^2 = 9 \\mod 40\\)

\\(3^3 = 27 \\mod 40\\)

\\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 40 = 1 \\mod 40\\) (Wait, 81 divided by 40 is 2 with remainder 1. So 3^4 = 81 ≡ 1 mod 40.

Wait, that's interesting. So 3^4 ≡ 1 mod 40. Therefore, 3^4 ≡ 1, so 3^14 can be written as (3^4)^3 × 3^2. Since 14 = 4*3 + 2.

Therefore, 3^14 = (3^4)^3 × 3^2 ≡ 1^3 × 9 ≡ 9 mod 40.

So 3^14 ≡ 9 mod 40. Therefore, 3^{2014} ≡ 9 mod 40. Therefore, going back to the original problem, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{9} \\mod 100\\).

Wait, but hold on. Let me check that again. The exponent 3^{2014} mod 40 is 9. Therefore, the original problem reduces to 3^9 mod 100. Let's compute 3^9.

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27

3^4 = 81

3^5 = 243 mod 100 = 43

3^6 = 129 mod 100 = 29

3^7 = 87

3^8 = 261 mod 100 = 61

3^9 = 183 mod 100 = 83

So 3^9 mod 100 is 83. Therefore, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are 83.

Wait, but let me verify this step by step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through each step again.

1. To find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\), compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\).

2. Euler's theorem says that since 3 and 100 are coprime, \\(3^{\\phi(100)} = 3^{40} ≡ 1 \\mod 100\\). So exponents can be reduced modulo 40.

3. Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 40)} \\mod 100\\).

4. Now, compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). To do this, note that 3 and 40 are coprime, so Euler's theorem applies. \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\), so \\(3^{16} ≡ 1 \\mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{(2014 \\mod 16)} \\mod 40\\).

5. Compute 2014 mod 16. 16 × 125 = 2000, so 2014 - 2000 = 14. Therefore, 2014 mod 16 = 14. So \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{14} \\mod 40\\).

6. Compute \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). Let's compute step by step:

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27

3^4 = 81 mod 40 = 1

3^5 = 3^4 × 3 = 1 × 3 = 3 mod 40

3^6 = 3^5 × 3 = 3 × 3 = 9 mod 40

3^7 = 9 × 3 = 27 mod 40

3^8 = 27 × 3 = 81 mod 40 = 1 mod 40

3^9 = 1 × 3 = 3 mod 40

3^10 = 3 × 3 = 9 mod 40

3^11 = 9 × 3 = 27 mod 40

3^12 = 27 × 3 = 81 mod 40 = 1 mod 40

3^13 = 1 × 3 = 3 mod 40

3^14 = 3 × 3 = 9 mod 40

Wait, so 3^14 mod 40 is 9. So that part checks out. Therefore, going back, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^9 \\mod 100\\). Then, as calculated earlier, 3^9 is 19683, which mod 100 is 83. So 83 is the answer.

But let me cross-verify this using another method to make sure. Maybe using Chinese Remainder Theorem. The modulus 100 factors into 4 and 25. If I can compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\), then combine them using CRT.

First, compute mod 4. 3 mod 4 is 3. 3^1 = 3 mod 4, 3^2 = 1 mod 4, 3^3 = 3 mod 4, 3^4 = 1 mod 4. So the pattern cycles every 2. Therefore, 3^k mod 4 is 3 if k is odd, 1 if k is even. Now, 3^{2014} is the exponent. Is 3^{2014} odd or even?

3 is odd, any power of 3 is odd. 3^{2014} is odd. Therefore, 3^{3^{2014}} mod 4 is 3 mod 4.

Now compute mod 25. So need to find \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\). Again, Euler's theorem: phi(25) = 20, so 3^20 ≡ 1 mod 25. Therefore, the exponent 3^{2014} can be reduced modulo 20. So compute 3^{2014} mod 20.

Compute 3^{2014} mod 20. Again, 3 and 20 are coprime. phi(20) = 8, so 3^8 ≡ 1 mod 20. Therefore, 3^{2014} mod 20 = 3^{2014 mod 8} mod 20.

Compute 2014 mod 8. 8 × 251 = 2008, so 2014 - 2008 = 6. Therefore, 3^{2014} mod 20 = 3^6 mod 20.

3^1 = 3 mod 20

3^2 = 9 mod 20

3^3 = 27 mod 20 = 7 mod 20

3^4 = 21 mod 20 = 1 mod 20

3^5 = 3 mod 20

3^6 = 9 mod 20

So 3^6 mod 20 = 9. Therefore, 3^{2014} mod 20 = 9. Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25 = 3^9 \\mod 25\\).

Compute 3^9 mod 25. Let's calculate:

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27 mod 25 = 2

3^4 = 6 mod 25

3^5 = 18 mod 25

3^6 = 54 mod 25 = 4

3^7 = 12 mod 25

3^8 = 36 mod 25 = 11

3^9 = 33 mod 25 = 8

So 3^9 mod 25 is 8.

Now, we have:

\\(3^{3^{2014}} \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\)

\\(3^{3^{2014}} \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\)

We need to find a number x such that x ≡ 3 mod 4 and x ≡ 8 mod 25. Let's solve this system.

Let x = 25k + 8. We need 25k + 8 ≡ 3 mod 4. 25 mod 4 is 1, so 25k mod 4 is k. Therefore, k + 8 ≡ 3 mod 4. 8 mod 4 is 0, so k ≡ 3 mod 4. Therefore, k = 4m + 3. Substitute back into x: x = 25*(4m + 3) + 8 = 100m + 75 + 8 = 100m + 83. Therefore, the smallest positive solution is 83 mod 100. So x ≡ 83 mod 100. Therefore, the last two digits are 83. This matches the previous result.

Therefore, both methods give the same answer, 83. So that seems solid.

But just to make sure, let me check another way. Maybe using patterns in powers of 3 mod 100. Let's compute some powers of 3 mod 100 and see if there's a cycle.

Compute:

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27

3^4 = 81

3^5 = 243 mod 100 = 43

3^6 = 129 mod 100 = 29

3^7 = 87

3^8 = 261 mod 100 = 61

3^9 = 183 mod 100 = 83

3^10 = 249 mod 100 = 49

3^11 = 147 mod 100 = 47

3^12 = 141 mod 100 = 41

3^13 = 123 mod 100 = 23

3^14 = 69

3^15 = 207 mod 100 = 7

3^16 = 21

3^17 = 63

3^18 = 189 mod 100 = 89

3^19 = 267 mod 100 = 67

3^20 = 201 mod 100 = 1

Wait, so 3^20 ≡ 1 mod 100. That's interesting. Wait, but earlier we saw that phi(100) is 40, so Euler's theorem gives 3^40 ≡ 1 mod 100. But here, 3^20 ≡ 1 mod 100. So the order of 3 modulo 100 is actually 20. That's a smaller exponent. Therefore, the cycle repeats every 20 exponents instead of 40. So maybe I can use this to reduce the exponent further.

Wait, so if 3^20 ≡ 1 mod 100, then 3^k ≡ 3^(k mod 20) mod 100. Therefore, in that case, the exponent 3^{2014} can be reduced modulo 20, not 40. Wait, but this contradicts the previous approach. Which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let's check. If 3^20 ≡ 1 mod 100, then the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 100 is 20. Therefore, exponents can be reduced modulo 20. Therefore, perhaps in the first step, instead of reducing modulo 40, we should reduce modulo 20. But why did Euler's theorem give 40? Because phi(100) = 40, so Euler's theorem only gives that 3^40 ≡ 1 mod 100, but in reality, the order might be a divisor of 40. Here, the order is 20. So maybe I should have considered that.

Therefore, perhaps my initial approach using Euler's theorem was too conservative. Let's redo the problem with this in mind.

So, first, since 3 and 100 are coprime, the multiplicative order of 3 modulo 100 is 20. Therefore, 3^20 ≡ 1 mod 100. Therefore, to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\), we can reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014}\\) modulo 20, not 40.

So, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 20)} \\mod 100\\). Therefore, now we need to compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\).

Again, 3 and 20 are coprime. Compute phi(20) = 8. Therefore, 3^8 ≡ 1 mod 20. Therefore, 3^{2014} mod 20 = 3^{2014 mod 8} mod 20.

2014 divided by 8: 8 × 251 = 2008, so 2014 - 2008 = 6. Therefore, 2014 mod 8 = 6. So 3^{2014} mod 20 = 3^6 mod 20.

Compute 3^6 mod 20. 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27 mod 20 = 7, 3^4 = 21 mod 20 = 1, 3^5 = 3 mod 20, 3^6 = 9 mod 20. So 3^6 mod 20 = 9. Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20 = 9\\). Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^9 \\mod 100 = 83\\). So same result.

Wait, so this approach also gives 83. So regardless of whether we use Euler's theorem with phi(100)=40 or observe that the order is 20, we end up with the same result. So the answer is 83. Therefore, this seems consistent.

But just to be thorough, let me check if the order of 3 modulo 100 is indeed 20. Let's compute 3^20 mod 100. As computed earlier:

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27

3^4 = 81

3^5 = 43

3^6 = 29

3^7 = 87

3^8 = 61

3^9 = 83

3^10 = 49

3^11 = 47

3^12 = 41

3^13 = 23

3^14 = 69

3^15 = 7

3^16 = 21

3^17 = 63

3^18 = 89

3^19 = 67

3^20 = 1

Yes, 3^20 is 1 mod 100. So the order is indeed 20. Therefore, reducing the exponent modulo 20 is valid. Hence, the correct approach is to reduce the exponent modulo 20, not 40. Therefore, why did the initial approach using Euler's theorem with phi(100)=40 work? Because even though the order is 20, which divides 40, we can still reduce the exponent modulo 40, but it's more efficient to reduce modulo 20. However, in my first approach, reducing modulo 40 gave the same result because 3^{2014} mod 40 was 9, and then 3^9 mod 100 is 83. So even if we use the larger modulus 40, we still get the right answer. But the key is that the exponent can be reduced modulo the order of 3 modulo 100, which is 20. Therefore, both methods are valid, but reducing modulo 20 is more straightforward.

Therefore, the answer is 83. So I think this is solid. Both methods confirm that the last two digits are 83. Therefore, the answer should be 83.

To find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\), we need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

1. **Using Euler's Theorem**:
   - Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). For \\(n = 100\\), \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\).
   - Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). We need to reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\).

2. **Reducing the exponent modulo 40**:
   - Compute \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\).
   - Euler's theorem gives \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). We need to reduce \\(2014 \\mod 16\\).
   - \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\), so we need \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\).
   - Observing \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), we get \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 \\cdot 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod 40\\).

3. **Final computation modulo 100**:
   - Now compute \\(3^9 \\mod 100\\).
   - Calculate step-by-step: \\(3^1 = 3\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(3^4 = 81\\), \\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\), \\(3^6 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\), \\(3^7 = 87\\), \\(3^8 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\), \\(3^9 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\).

4. **Verification using Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
   - Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\).
   - Modulo 4: \\(3 \\equiv -1 \\mod 4\\), so \\(3^{\\text{odd}} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\).
   - Modulo 25: Compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\) (since \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\)), then \\(3^{2014} \\mod 8 = 6\\), so \\(3^6 \\mod 20 = 9\\). Then \\(3^9 \\mod 25 = 8\\).
   - Combine results using Chinese Remainder Theorem: \\(x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) and \\(x \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\) gives \\(x = 83 \\mod 100\\).

Thus, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\(\\boxed{83}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\). Hmm, that's a pretty big exponent. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that finding the last two digits of a number is the same as finding the number modulo 100. So, essentially, I need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

First, maybe I can use Euler's theorem here. Euler's theorem states that if two numbers are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\), where \\(\\phi(n)\\) is Euler's totient function. Since 3 and 100 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), Euler's theorem should apply. Let me calculate \\(\\phi(100)\\). 

100 factors into \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\), so \\(\\phi(100) = 100 \\times (1 - 1/2) \\times (1 - 1/5) = 100 \\times 1/2 \\times 4/5 = 100 \\times 2/5 = 40\\). So, \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\). That means \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). Therefore, \\(3^k \\mod 100\\) will repeat every 40 exponents. 

But the exponent here is \\(3^{2014}\\), which is a huge number. To use Euler's theorem, I need to reduce this exponent modulo 40. Wait, no, actually, Euler's theorem tells me that \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\), so \\(3^{k} \\equiv 3^{k \\mod 40} \\mod 100\\) if k is a multiple of 40. But since \\(3^{2014}\\) is the exponent, I need to find \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\) first. 

So, let's compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). Again, to compute this, maybe I can use Euler's theorem again. Let's see, 40 factors into \\(2^3 \\times 5\\), so \\(\\phi(40) = 40 \\times (1 - 1/2) \\times (1 - 1/5) = 40 \\times 1/2 \\times 4/5 = 40 \\times 2/5 = 16\\). Therefore, \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), provided that 3 and 40 are coprime, which they are. 

So, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\) can be simplified by reducing the exponent 2014 modulo 16. Let's compute 2014 divided by 16. 16*125 = 2000, so 2014 - 2000 = 14. Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{14} \\mod 40\\). Now, I need to compute \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). 

Calculating \\(3^1 = 3 \\mod 40\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 40 = 1\\), \\(3^4 = 1\\). Wait, \\(3^4\\) is 81, which mod 40 is 1. So, \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 \\times 3^2 = 1^3 \\times 9 = 9 \\mod 40\\). 

Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 9\\). So, going back to the original problem, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{9} \\mod 100\\). Wait, is that right? Because Euler's theorem told us that \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\), so \\(3^{k} \\equiv 3^{k \\mod 40} \\mod 100\\), provided k is a multiple of 40. But here, \\(3^{2014}\\) is the exponent, so we need \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 40)} \\mod 100\\). 

But we found that \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 9\\), so it's \\(3^9 \\mod 100\\). Let me compute \\(3^9\\). 

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27

3^4 = 81

3^5 = 243 mod 100 = 43

3^6 = 3^5 * 3 = 43 * 3 = 129 mod 100 = 29

3^7 = 29 * 3 = 87

3^8 = 87 * 3 = 261 mod 100 = 61

3^9 = 61 * 3 = 183 mod 100 = 83

So, \\(3^9 \\mod 100 = 83\\). Therefore, the last two digits should be 83. 

Wait, but let me check if this is correct. Let me verify the steps again. 

First, we have \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). Euler's theorem gives \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\), so we need \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). Then, we compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). For that, we use Euler's theorem again on modulus 40, which gives us that \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(2014 \\mod 16\\). 

2014 divided by 16: 16*125=2000, so 2014-2000=14. So, 2014 mod 16 =14. Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{14} \\mod 40\\). 

But earlier, I noticed that \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), so \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 * 3^2 = 1^3 * 9 = 9 \\mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^9 \\mod 100 = 83\\). 

But let me check this again. Maybe there is a mistake in the step where I reduced \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\) using Euler's theorem. Wait, Euler's theorem requires that the base and modulus are coprime. 3 and 40 are coprime, so Euler's theorem applies. Therefore, \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} = 3^{16 * 125 + 14} = (3^{16})^{125} * 3^{14} \\equiv 1^{125} * 3^{14} \\mod 40\\). So, \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). 

But as I calculated earlier, \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), so \\(3^{14} = 3^{4*3 + 2} = (3^4)^3 * 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 * 9 = 9 \\mod 40\\). So, that's correct. 

Then, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^9 \\mod 100 = 83\\). Therefore, the last two digits are 83. 

Wait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe using Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since 100 = 4 * 25, and 4 and 25 are coprime, we can compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\), then combine the results. 

First, compute modulo 4. 

\\(3 \\mod 4 = -1\\), so \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4 = (-1)^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\). Since 3^{2014} is an exponent. Since any power of 3 is odd, because 3 is odd and any power of an odd number is odd. Therefore, \\(3^{2014}\\) is odd, so \\(-1^{\\text{odd}} = -1 \\mod 4\\). Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\equiv -1 \\mod 4\\) which is 3 mod 4. 

Now, compute modulo 25. 

We need \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\). For this, Euler's theorem tells us that since \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\), \\(3^{20} \\equiv 1 \\mod 25\\). Therefore, \\(3^{k} \\mod 25 = 3^{k \\mod 20} \\mod 25\\). So, we need to compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\). 

Compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\). Again, using Euler's theorem here. Since \\(\\phi(20) = 8\\), \\(3^8 \\equiv 1 \\mod 20\\). So, \\(3^{2014} = 3^{8*251 + 6} = (3^8)^{251} * 3^6 \\equiv 1^{251} * 3^6 \\mod 20\\). Compute \\(3^6\\). 

3^1 = 3 mod 20

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27 mod 20 = 7

3^4 = 7*3 = 21 mod 20 = 1

3^4 = 1 mod 20. Therefore, \\(3^6 = 3^4 * 3^2 = 1 * 9 = 9 mod 20. 

Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20 = 9\\). Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25 = 3^9 \\mod 25\\). Compute \\(3^9\\). 

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27 mod 25 = 2

3^4 = 2*3 = 6

3^5 = 6*3 = 18

3^6 = 18*3 = 54 mod 25 = 4

3^7 = 4*3 = 12

3^8 = 12*3 = 36 mod 25 = 11

3^9 = 11*3 = 33 mod 25 = 8

Wait, that's different from before. Wait, so according to this, \\(3^9 \\mod 25 = 8\\). So, combining modulo 4 and 25. 

We have \\(x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) and \\(x \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\). Find x mod 100. 

Let me solve the congruence. Let x = 25k + 8. Then, 25k + 8 ≡ 3 mod 4. 25 mod 4 = 1, so 1*k + 0 ≡ 3 mod 4. Therefore, k ≡ 3 mod 4. So, k = 4m + 3. Therefore, x = 25*(4m + 3) + 8 = 100m + 75 + 8 = 100m + 83. Therefore, x ≡ 83 mod 100. 

Therefore, combining both results, the last two digits are 83. So, that's consistent with the first method. 

Therefore, both methods give 83. So, that seems correct. 

But let me check once again with another approach. Maybe using the fact that 3^20 ≡ 1 mod 25 and 3^2 = 9 mod 4, but perhaps that's complicating. Alternatively, maybe compute 3^9 directly mod 100. 

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27

3^4 = 81

3^5 = 243 mod 100 = 43

3^6 = 43*3 = 129 mod 100 = 29

3^7 = 29*3 = 87

3^8 = 87*3 = 261 mod 100 = 61

3^9 = 61*3 = 183 mod 100 = 83

Yes, so 3^9 is 83 mod 100. Therefore, both methods confirm that the last two digits are 83. 

Therefore, the answer should be 83. 

But let me check with another exponent. For example, if the exponent was smaller. Let's say, what is 3^3 mod 100? 27. 3^3^1 = 27. 3^3^2 = 3^27. Let's compute 3^27 mod 100. 

But 3^20 ≡ 1 mod 25, so 27 mod 20 = 7. Then 3^7 mod 25. 3^5 = 18, 3^6 = 54 mod 25 = 4, 3^7 = 12 mod 25. Then, 3^27 mod 4: since exponent is 27, which is odd, 3^27 mod 4 = 3 mod 4. Then, solving x ≡ 3 mod 4 and x ≡ 12 mod 25. 

x = 25k + 12. 25k + 12 ≡ 3 mod 4. 25k ≡ 3 -12 mod 4 => 25k ≡ -9 ≡ (-1) mod 4. 25 ≡ 1 mod 4, so k ≡ -1 mod 4 => k ≡ 3 mod 4. So, k=4m +3. Then x=25*(4m +3)+12=100m +75 +12=100m +87. So, 87 mod 100. So, 3^27 mod 100=87. 

But according to our formula, if we followed the same steps: 3^{3^2}=3^9. Wait, no, exponent here is 3^2=9, so 3^9=83. Wait, but in this case, the exponent is 3^2=9, so 3^9=83. But in the previous case, 3^27 is different. Wait, but 3^27 is not 3^9. Wait, maybe I confused the notation. 

But in any case, the process seems consistent. Therefore, I think the answer is 83. 

**Final Answer**
The last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\boxed{83}.

To find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\), we need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

1. **Using Euler's Theorem**:
   - Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). For \\(n = 100\\), \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\).
   - Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). We need to reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\).

2. **Reducing the exponent modulo 40**:
   - Compute \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\).
   - Euler's theorem gives \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). We need to reduce \\(2014 \\mod 16\\).
   - \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\), so we need \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\).
   - Observing \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), we get \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 \\cdot 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod 40\\).

3. **Final computation modulo 100**:
   - Now compute \\(3^9 \\mod 100\\).
   - Calculate step-by-step: \\(3^1 = 3\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(3^4 = 81\\), \\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\), \\(3^6 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\), \\(3^7 = 87\\), \\(3^8 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\), \\(3^9 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\).

4. **Verification using Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
   - Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\).
   - Modulo 4: \\(3 \\equiv -1 \\mod 4\\), so \\(3^{\\text{odd}} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\).
   - Modulo 25: Compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\) (since \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\)), then \\(3^{2014} \\mod 8 = 6\\), so \\(3^6 \\mod 20 = 9\\). Then \\(3^9 \\mod 25 = 8\\).
   - Combine results using Chinese Remainder Theorem: \\(x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) and \\(x \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\) gives \\(x = 83 \\mod 100\\).

Thus, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\(\\boxed{83}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\). Hmm, that's a pretty big exponent. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with the last two digits of a number, it's equivalent to calculating the number modulo 100. So, essentially, I need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\).

Alright, first step: compute \\(3^{2014}\\) first, then use that as the exponent for 3. But wait, \\(3^{2014}\\) is already a huge number. Direct computation is impossible. I need a smarter way. Maybe using Euler's theorem or something?

Euler's theorem says that if two numbers are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). Since 3 and 100 are coprime, this should apply here. Let's compute \\(\\phi(100)\\). Since 100 factors into \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\), \\(\\phi(100) = 100 \\times (1 - 1/2) \\times (1 - 1/5) = 100 \\times 1/2 \\times 4/5 = 40\\). So, \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). That means \\(3^k \\mod 100\\) cycles every 40. So, if I can find \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\), then I can write \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 40)} \\mod 100\\).

Okay, so now I need to compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). Let's do the same approach here. Compute \\(\\phi(40)\\) to apply Euler's theorem again. 40 factors into \\(2^3 \\times 5\\), so \\(\\phi(40) = 40 \\times (1 - 1/2) \\times (1 - 1/5) = 40 \\times 1/2 \\times 4/5 = 16\\). Therefore, \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). So, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{(2014 \\mod 16)} \\mod 40\\).

Now, compute \\(2014 \\mod 16\\). Let's divide 2014 by 16. 16*125 = 2000, so 2014 - 2000 = 14. Therefore, 2014 mod 16 is 14. So, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{14} \\mod 40\\).

Okay, compute \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). Let's calculate step by step. 3^1 = 3 mod 40. 3^2 = 9 mod 40. 3^3 = 27 mod 40. 3^4 = 81 mod 40 = 1 mod 40. Wait, 3^4 is 81, which is 1 mod 40. Then 3^4 ≡ 1 mod 40. Therefore, 3^4 = 1 mod 40, so 3^(4k) ≡ 1^k ≡ 1 mod 40.

Therefore, 3^14 = 3^(4*3 + 2) = (3^4)^3 * 3^2 ≡ 1^3 * 9 ≡ 9 mod 40. So, 3^14 ≡ 9 mod 40. Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 9\\).

Therefore, going back, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^9 \\mod 100\\). Compute 3^9. Let's compute step by step:

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27

3^4 = 81

3^5 = 243 mod 100 = 43

3^6 = 43*3 = 129 mod 100 = 29

3^7 = 29*3 = 87

3^8 = 87*3 = 261 mod 100 = 61

3^9 = 61*3 = 183 mod 100 = 83

Therefore, 3^9 mod 100 is 83. So, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are 83. Wait, is that right?

Wait, let me verify my steps again. First, compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). We used Euler's theorem to reduce the exponent modulo 40. Then, to compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\), we used Euler's theorem again, reducing the exponent modulo φ(40)=16. Then, 2014 mod 16 is 14, so \\(3^{14} mod 40\\). Then, since 3^4=81≡1 mod 40, 3^14= (3^4)^3 * 3^2 ≡1^3*9=9 mod 40. Therefore, exponent is 9. Then 3^9 mod 100=83. That seems correct.

But wait, let me cross-check with another method. Maybe using Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since 100=4*25, and 4 and 25 are coprime. So, compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\), then combine the results.

Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\). Since 3 mod 4 is -1, so \\(3^k \\mod 4 = (-1)^k \\mod 4\\). Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4 = (-1)^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\). Since 3^{2014} is an odd exponent, because 3 is odd, any exponent of 3 is odd. Therefore, (-1)^odd = -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. So, the result mod 4 is 3.

Now compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\). For this, use Euler's theorem. φ(25)=20, since 25 is 5^2. So, 3^20 ≡1 mod 25. Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 20)} \\mod 25\\).

So need to compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\). Again, φ(20)=8, since 20=2^2*5, φ(20)=20*(1-1/2)*(1-1/5)=20*1/2*4/5=8. So, 3^8 ≡1 mod 20. Therefore, 3^{2014} mod 20 = 3^{(2014 mod 8)} mod 20.

2014 divided by 8: 8*251=2008, so 2014-2008=6. Therefore, 2014 mod 8=6. Therefore, 3^6 mod 20. Compute 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27≡7 mod 20, 3^4=21≡1 mod 20. Wait, 3^4=81≡1 mod 20. Therefore, 3^4≡1 mod 20. So, 3^6=3^(4+2)=3^4*3^2≡1*9=9 mod 20. Therefore, 3^{2014} mod 20=9.

Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25 = 3^9 \\mod 25\\). Compute 3^9 mod 25. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27≡2 mod 25, 3^4=6, 3^5=18, 3^6=54≡4 mod 25, 3^7=12, 3^8=36≡11 mod 25, 3^9=33≡8 mod 25. Wait, 3^3=27≡2 mod 25. Then 3^4=6, 3^5=18, 3^6=54≡4, 3^7=12, 3^8=36≡11, 3^9=33≡8 mod 25. Therefore, 3^9 ≡8 mod 25.

So, now we have the result mod 4 is 3, mod 25 is 8. We need to find a number x such that x ≡3 mod 4 and x ≡8 mod 25. Let's solve these congruences.

Find x ≡8 mod 25. So x=25k +8. Substitute into the first equation: 25k +8 ≡3 mod 4. 25 mod 4 is 1, so 1*k +8 ≡3 mod4. 8 mod4=0, so k ≡3 mod4. Therefore, k=4m +3. Therefore, x=25*(4m +3)+8=100m +75 +8=100m +83. Therefore, the smallest positive solution is x=83 mod100. So, the last two digits are 83. That matches the previous result. So, seems correct.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check another way. Suppose I use the first method again. Compute 3^3^2014 mod100. As we did before, using Euler's theorem twice. So, φ(100)=40, so exponent 3^2014 mod40. Then φ(40)=16, so 2014 mod16=14. So 3^14 mod40=9. Then 3^9 mod100=83. Same result.

Alternatively, using the Chinese Remainder Theorem as above, also gives 83. So, seems consistent.

But just to be absolutely sure, let me compute 3^9 mod100 again. 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, 3^4=81, 3^5=243 mod100=43, 3^6=43*3=129 mod100=29, 3^7=29*3=87, 3^8=87*3=261 mod100=61, 3^9=61*3=183 mod100=83. Yep, 83.

Alternatively, compute 3^3^2014 mod 100. Since 3^2014 is a huge exponent, but we reduced it to 9. So, 3^9=19683, which mod100 is 83. So, all methods point to 83.

But just to check if there's any possible mistake. Let me verify the steps again.

First, φ(100)=40. So, 3^40 ≡1 mod100. Therefore, 3^k ≡3^(k mod40) mod100. So, exponent is 3^2014. So, need 3^2014 mod40. To compute that, φ(40)=16. So, 3^16≡1 mod40. Therefore, 3^2014≡3^(2014 mod16) mod40. 2014 divided by16: 16*125=2000, so 2014-2000=14. So, 3^14 mod40. Then, 3^4=81≡1 mod40, so 3^14= (3^4)^3 *3^2=1^3*9=9 mod40. Therefore, exponent is 9. Then, 3^9=19683, which mod100 is 83.

Alternatively, using Chinese Remainder Theorem:

Mod4: 3^{anything odd}≡3 mod4. Since 3^{2014} is 3^even? Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, 3^{2014} is 3^(even number), but the exponent in the original problem is 3^{2014}, which is definitely an odd exponent. Wait, 3 is odd, any exponent of 3 is odd. Wait, 3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27, etc. So, 3^{2014} is 3 raised to an even exponent? Wait, no, 2014 is even? Wait, 2014 is even? 2014 divided by 2 is 1007. So, yes, 2014 is even. Wait, but 3^{even} is 9 mod4. Wait, 3^1=3 mod4, 3^2=1 mod4, 3^3=3 mod4, 3^4=1 mod4. So, 3^even ≡1 mod4, 3^odd≡3 mod4. Therefore, 3^{2014} is 3^even, so 1 mod4. Wait, but in our previous calculation, when we computed \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod4\\), we said that 3^{2014} is an odd exponent, but that's not correct. Wait, hold on, the exponent here is 3^{2014}, which is 3 raised to 2014. Since 3 is odd and 2014 is even, 3^{2014} is odd^{even} which is odd. Wait, odd^any is odd. So, 3^{2014} is odd. Therefore, the exponent in 3^{3^{2014}} is an odd exponent. Therefore, 3^{odd} mod4=3 mod4. But earlier, when we computed via Chinese Remainder Theorem, we had x≡3 mod4. Wait, but in the first method, using Euler's theorem, we had 3^{3^{2014}} ≡3^9 mod100=83, which is 83 mod4= 83-80=3 mod4. So, that's consistent. Wait, but in the Chinese Remainder Theorem approach, when we computed mod4, we had 3^{3^{2014}} mod4=3^{odd} mod4=3 mod4. Which is correct. So, that's okay.

But wait, in the initial problem, the exponent is 3^{2014}, which is 3^even. Wait, 3^{2014} is 3^(even exponent). So, 3^even is 1 mod4? Wait, no. Wait, 3^1=3 mod4, 3^2=1 mod4, 3^3=3 mod4, 3^4=1 mod4. So, 3^{even}=1 mod4, 3^{odd}=3 mod4. Therefore, 3^{2014} is 3^{even}=1 mod4. Wait, but then, 3^{3^{2014}} mod4=3^{1 mod something}? Wait, no, wait. The exponent here is 3^{2014}, which is 1 mod something. Wait, no, the exponent is 3^{2014}, which is 3^even. So, 3^{even}=1 mod4. Therefore, 3^{3^{2014}} mod4=3^1 mod4=3 mod4. Wait, but 3^{2014} is 1 mod φ(4)=2? Wait, φ(4)=2. So, 3^1 mod2=1. Therefore, 3^{3^{2014}} mod4=3^{1} mod4=3 mod4. Wait, this is conflicting with my earlier thought. Let me clarify.

To compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod4\\), we can note that φ(4)=2. So, 3^2≡1 mod4. Therefore, \\(3^{k} \\mod4=3^{k mod2} \\mod4\\). So, we need to compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod2\\). But 3 is odd, so 3^{2014} is 1 mod2 (since any odd number to any power is 1 mod2). Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod4=3^{1} \\mod4=3 mod4\\). So, that's correct. Therefore, the result mod4 is 3. Which matches our previous calculation. So, that's okay.

Therefore, all steps check out. The answer is 83.

But wait, just to be 100% sure, let's compute 3^3^2014 mod100 using another exponentiation method. For example, using the fact that 3^4=81≡-19 mod100, but that might not help. Alternatively, compute 3^2014 first mod40, which we did as 9, so 3^9=19683, which ends with 83. Alternatively, compute 3^3^2014 step by step using exponents, but that's not feasible. However, given that both methods (Euler's theorem and Chinese Remainder Theorem) give 83, and the calculations for each step check out, I can be confident that the last two digits are 83.

Therefore, the final answer should be \\boxed{83}.

To find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\), we need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

1. **Using Euler's Theorem**:
   - Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). For \\(n = 100\\), \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\).
   - Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). We need to reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\).

2. **Reducing the exponent modulo 40**:
   - Compute \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\).
   - Euler's theorem gives \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). We need to reduce \\(2014 \\mod 16\\).
   - \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\), so we need \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\).
   - Observing \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), we get \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 \\cdot 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod 40\\).

3. **Final computation modulo 100**:
   - Now compute \\(3^9 \\mod 100\\).
   - Calculate step-by-step: \\(3^1 = 3\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(3^4 = 81\\), \\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\), \\(3^6 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\), \\(3^7 = 87\\), \\(3^8 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\), \\(3^9 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\).

4. **Verification using Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
   - Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\).
   - Modulo 4: \\(3 \\equiv -1 \\mod 4\\), so \\(3^{\\text{odd}} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\).
   - Modulo 25: Compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\) (since \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\)), then \\(3^{2014} \\mod 8 = 6\\), so \\(3^6 \\mod 20 = 9\\). Then \\(3^9 \\mod 25 = 8\\).
   - Combine results using Chinese Remainder Theorem: \\(x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) and \\(x \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\) gives \\(x = 83 \\mod 100\\).

Thus, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\(\\boxed{83}\\).

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, so I need to find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\). Hmm, let's see. The last two digits of a number are equivalent to the number modulo 100. So, essentially, I need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). Alright, that's the plan.

First, I remember that Euler's theorem might be helpful here. Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\), where \\(\\phi(n)\\) is Euler's totient function. Since 3 and 100 are coprime (their greatest common divisor is 1), this theorem applies. Let me compute \\(\\phi(100)\\). 

The number 100 factors into \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\). The totient function is multiplicative for coprime factors, so \\(\\phi(100) = \\phi(2^2) \\times \\phi(5^2)\\). Calculating each part: \\(\\phi(2^2) = 2^2 - 2^1 = 4 - 2 = 2\\), and \\(\\phi(5^2) = 5^2 - 5^1 = 25 - 5 = 20\\). Therefore, \\(\\phi(100) = 2 \\times 20 = 40\\). So, Euler's theorem tells me that \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). 

That means \\(3^{k} \\mod 100\\) will repeat every 40 exponents. So, to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\), I need to find the exponent \\(3^{2014}\\) modulo 40, right? Because \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 40)} \\mod 100\\). Let me verify that. Yes, because \\(a^b \\equiv a^{b \\mod \\phi(n)} \\mod n\\) when \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime. So, since 3 and 100 are coprime, this holds. Wait, actually, Euler's theorem gives \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\), so the exponents cycle every \\(\\phi(n)\\). Therefore, \\(a^b \\mod n = a^{b \\mod \\phi(n)} \\mod n\\) if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime and \\(b \\geq \\phi(n)\\). So, in this case, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 40)} \\mod 100\\). 

So, now the problem reduces to computing \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). Let's work on that. To compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\), I can again use Euler's theorem. Let's check if 3 and 40 are coprime. Since 40 factors into \\(2^3 \\times 5\\), and 3 is coprime to 40, yes, they are coprime. So, Euler's theorem applies here. Let's compute \\(\\phi(40)\\).

Breaking down 40 into prime factors: \\(2^3 \\times 5\\). So, \\(\\phi(40) = \\phi(2^3) \\times \\phi(5)\\). Calculating each part: \\(\\phi(2^3) = 2^3 - 2^2 = 8 - 4 = 4\\), and \\(\\phi(5) = 5 - 1 = 4\\). Therefore, \\(\\phi(40) = 4 \\times 4 = 16\\). So, \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{2014 \\mod 16} \\mod 40\\). 

Now, compute \\(2014 \\mod 16\\). Let's divide 2014 by 16. 16*125 = 2000, so 2014 - 2000 = 14. Therefore, \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{14} \\mod 40\\). 

So, now I need to compute \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\). Let's compute \\(3^{14}\\). Let's compute step by step:

\\(3^1 = 3 \\mod 40\\)

\\(3^2 = 9 \\mod 40\\)

\\(3^3 = 27 \\mod 40\\)

\\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 40 = 81 - 2*40 = 1 \\mod 40\\)

Wait, \\(3^4 = 81\\), and 81 divided by 40 is 2 with remainder 1. So, \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). That's interesting. So, \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), which means the powers of 3 modulo 40 cycle every 4 exponents. Therefore, \\(3^{14} = 3^{4*3 + 2} = (3^4)^3 * 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 * 9 \\mod 40 \\equiv 9 \\mod 40\\). 

Wait, that seems right. Alternatively, maybe compute \\(3^{14}\\) directly:

\\(3^4 = 81 ≡ 1 mod 40\\)

\\(3^5 = 3^4 * 3 ≡ 1*3 = 3 mod 40\\)

\\(3^6 = 3^5 *3 ≡ 3*3=9 mod 40\\)

\\(3^7=9*3=27 mod 40\\)

\\(3^8=27*3=81≡1 mod 40\\)

Wait, so 3^8 ≡1 mod 40. So, cycle length is 4? Wait, but 3^4 ≡1, then 3^8=(3^4)^2≡1^2=1. So, yes, the cycle is every 4. But 3^4≡1, 3^5≡3, 3^6≡9, 3^7≡27, 3^8≡1, etc. So, the cycle is of length 4. Therefore, 3^{4k + r} ≡ (3^4)^k * 3^r ≡1^k *3^r ≡3^r mod 40. Therefore, 3^{14}=3^{4*3 + 2}= (3^4)^3 *3^2 ≡1^3 *9=9 mod 40. So, 3^{14}≡9 mod 40. Therefore, going back, 3^{2014}≡9 mod 40.

Therefore, the original exponent in the problem is 3^{2014}≡9 mod 40. Therefore, 3^{3^{2014}}≡3^9 mod 100. Now, compute 3^9 mod 100.

Compute 3^1=3 mod 100

3^2=9

3^3=27

3^4=81

3^5=243 mod 100=43

3^6=3^5*3=43*3=129 mod 100=29

3^7=29*3=87

3^8=87*3=261 mod 100=61

3^9=61*3=183 mod 100=83

So, 3^9 mod 100=83. Therefore, the last two digits of 3^{3^{2014}} are 83. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent reduction steps. Let me verify each step carefully.

First, compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). Since 3 and 100 are coprime, Euler's theorem tells us \\(3^{40}≡1 mod 100\\). Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} ≡3^{(3^{2014} mod 40)} mod 100\\). Then, compute \\(3^{2014} mod 40\\). For that, since 3 and 40 are coprime, Euler's theorem gives \\(3^{16}≡1 mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} ≡3^{(2014 mod 16)} mod 40\\). 2014 divided by 16: 16*125=2000, so 2014-2000=14. Therefore, 2014 mod 16=14. So, \\(3^{2014} ≡3^{14} mod 40\\). 

Compute \\(3^{14} mod 40\\). Let's compute 3^4=81≡1 mod 40. Therefore, 3^4≡1, so 3^{14}=3^{4*3 + 2}= (3^4)^3 *3^2 ≡1^3 *9=9 mod 40. Therefore, 3^{14}≡9 mod 40. Therefore, 3^{3^{2014}}≡3^9 mod 100. Compute 3^9:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^3=27

3^4=81

3^5=243-2*100=43

3^6=43*3=129-100=29

3^7=29*3=87

3^8=87*3=261-2*100=61

3^9=61*3=183-100=83

Yes, so 3^9=19683, which ends with 83. So, the last two digits are 83. 

But let me cross-verify this using another method. Maybe using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Since 100=4*25, and 4 and 25 are coprime, compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\), then combine the results.

First, compute mod 4. 3 mod 4=3. 3^1=3, 3^2=1, 3^3=3, 3^4=1, so the cycle is 2. Therefore, 3^{3^{2014}} mod 4. Since 3^{2014} is an exponent. If the exponent is even, 3^{even}≡1 mod 4. If it's odd, 3^{odd}≡3 mod 4. So, 3^{2014} is 3 raised to an even exponent (2014 is even), so 3^{2014} is 3^{even}≡1 mod 2. Wait, but 3^{2014} is the exponent here. Wait, no, the exponent in 3^{3^{2014}} is 3^{2014}. So, we have 3^{k} mod 4, where k=3^{2014}. So, since 3 is congruent to -1 mod 4, so 3^k ≡ (-1)^k mod 4. Therefore, if k is even, it's 1; if odd, it's 3. So, 3^{2014} is 3^{even} exponent. Wait, 2014 is even, so 3^{2014} is 3^{even} power. But 3^{even} is (3^2)^{even/2} = 9^{even/2} ≡1^{even/2}=1 mod 4. Wait, but 3^{2014} mod 2? Wait, maybe I confused steps here.

Wait, let me clarify. We have k=3^{2014}. So, 3^{2014} is some exponent. To compute (-1)^k mod 4. If k is even, then (-1)^k=1; if k is odd, (-1)^k=-1≡3 mod 4. Therefore, we need to check if k=3^{2014} is even or odd.

But 3^{2014} is 3 raised to any power. Since 3 is odd, any power of 3 is also odd. Therefore, 3^{2014} is odd. Therefore, (-1)^{odd}= -1≡3 mod 4. Therefore, 3^{3^{2014}}≡3 mod 4.

Now, compute mod 25. The Chinese Remainder Theorem tells us that if we have x ≡3 mod 4 and x≡? mod 25, then x ≡83 mod 100. So, let's compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\).

To compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\), Euler's theorem applies here as well. Since 3 and 25 are coprime, \\(\\phi(25)=20\\). Therefore, \\(3^{20}≡1 mod 25\\). So, \\(3^{3^{2014}}≡3^{(3^{2014} mod 20)} mod 25\\). Therefore, we need to compute \\(3^{2014} mod 20\\).

Compute \\(3^{2014} mod 20\\). Again, Euler's theorem: since 3 and 20 are coprime, \\(\\phi(20)=8\\). So, \\(3^8≡1 mod 20\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014}≡3^{(2014 mod 8)} mod 20\\). Compute 2014 mod 8: 8*251=2008, so 2014-2008=6. Therefore, 2014 mod 8=6. Therefore, \\(3^{2014}≡3^6 mod 20\\).

Compute \\(3^6 mod 20\\). \\(3^1=3, 3^2=9, 3^3=27≡7, 3^4=21≡1, 3^5=3, 3^6=9 mod 20\\). Wait, 3^4=81≡1 mod 20. Then, 3^5=3^4*3≡1*3=3 mod 20. 3^6=3^5*3≡3*3=9 mod 20. So, 3^6≡9 mod 20. Therefore, \\(3^{2014}≡9 mod 20\\). Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}}≡3^9 mod 25\\).

Compute \\(3^9 mod 25\\). Let's compute step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^3=27≡2 mod 25

3^4=2*3=6 mod 25

3^5=6*3=18 mod 25

3^6=18*3=54≡4 mod 25

3^7=4*3=12 mod 25

3^8=12*3=36≡11 mod 25

3^9=11*3=33≡8 mod 25

Wait, so 3^9≡8 mod 25. Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}}≡8 mod 25\\). 

Now, we have two congruences:

x ≡3 mod 4

x ≡8 mod 25

We need to find x mod 100. Let's solve these congruences.

Let x=25k +8. Then, 25k +8 ≡3 mod 4. 25 mod 4=1, 8 mod 4=0. Therefore, 1*k +0 ≡3 mod 4 => k≡3 mod 4. Therefore, k=4m +3. Therefore, x=25*(4m +3) +8=100m +75 +8=100m +83. Therefore, the smallest positive solution is x≡83 mod 100. Therefore, the last two digits are 83. 

This matches the previous result. So, both methods lead to the conclusion that the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are 83. Therefore, the answer should be 83.

But wait, let me check once again with another approach. Maybe using the fact that 3^4=81≡-19 mod 100. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps compute 3^{3^{2014}} mod 100 directly using the Chinese Remainder Theorem approach as done earlier. But both methods gave 83, so that's reassuring.

Alternatively, maybe compute 3^{3^{2014}} mod 100 using exponentiation by squaring. But given that the exponent is 3^{2014}, which is a huge number, but since we can reduce the exponent modulo 40 first, then compute 3^9 mod 100, which we did, and got 83.

Another sanity check: Let's compute 3^{3^4} mod 100 and see if the pattern holds. 3^4=81, so 3^{81} mod 100. But 3^40≡1 mod 100, so 81 mod 40=1. So, 3^{81}≡3^1=3 mod 100. Wait, but 3^{81} is 3^{40+40+1}=3^{40}*3^{40}*3^1≡1*1*3=3 mod 100. But 3^{81} is actually 3^81, which is a huge number, but modulo 100, it's 3. Wait, but 3^4=81, 3^5=243≡43, 3^6=129≡29, 3^7=87, 3^8=61, 3^9=83, 3^10=49, 3^20≡(3^10)^2=49^2=2401≡1 mod 100. Wait, so 3^20≡1 mod 100. Therefore, 3^{20k}≡1. Therefore, 3^{80}=3^{20*4}≡1 mod 100. Then, 3^{81}=3^{80}*3≡1*3=3 mod 100. So, that works. So, 3^{81}≡3 mod 100. So, if we take 3^{3^4}=3^{81}≡3 mod 100. But according to our previous method, 3^{3^4} would be 3^{81}≡3^{(81 mod 40)}=3^{1}≡3 mod 100. Which matches. So, the method works here.

Another test case: Let's take 3^{3^1}=3^3=27 mod 100. Using the method: Compute exponent 3^1=3. 3 mod 40=3. So, 3^3=27 mod 100. Correct.

3^{3^2}=3^9=19683≡83 mod 100. Using our method: exponent 3^2=9. 9 mod 40=9. So, 3^9=19683≡83 mod 100. Correct.

3^{3^3}=3^{27}. Compute 27 mod 40=27. So, 3^27 mod 100. Let's compute 3^27. Since 3^20≡1 mod 100, 3^27=3^20*3^7≡1*3^7. 3^7=87 mod 100. So, 3^27≡87 mod 100. Alternatively, compute step by step:

3^1=3

3^2=9

3^3=27

3^4=81

3^5=43

3^6=29

3^7=87

3^8=61

3^9=83

3^10=49

3^20≡1

3^27=3^(20+7)=3^20*3^7≡1*87=87 mod 100. Correct. So, method works here.

Therefore, given that all test cases work, the method is valid. Therefore, the final answer should be 83.

**Final Answer**
The last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\boxed{83}.

To find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\), we need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). 

1. **Using Euler's Theorem**:
   - Euler's theorem states that if \\(a\\) and \\(n\\) are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). For \\(n = 100\\), \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\).
   - Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). We need to reduce the exponent \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\).

2. **Reducing the exponent modulo 40**:
   - Compute \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\).
   - Euler's theorem gives \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). We need to reduce \\(2014 \\mod 16\\).
   - \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\), so we need \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\).
   - Observing \\(3^4 \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\), we get \\(3^{14} = (3^4)^3 \\cdot 3^2 \\equiv 1^3 \\cdot 9 \\equiv 9 \\mod 40\\).

3. **Final computation modulo 100**:
   - Now compute \\(3^9 \\mod 100\\).
   - Calculate step-by-step: \\(3^1 = 3\\), \\(3^2 = 9\\), \\(3^3 = 27\\), \\(3^4 = 81\\), \\(3^5 = 243 \\mod 100 = 43\\), \\(3^6 = 129 \\mod 100 = 29\\), \\(3^7 = 87\\), \\(3^8 = 261 \\mod 100 = 61\\), \\(3^9 = 183 \\mod 100 = 83\\).

4. **Verification using Chinese Remainder Theorem**:
   - Compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 25\\).
   - Modulo 4: \\(3 \\equiv -1 \\mod 4\\), so \\(3^{\\text{odd}} \\equiv -1 \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\).
   - Modulo 25: Compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 20\\) (since \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\)), then \\(3^{2014} \\mod 8 = 6\\), so \\(3^6 \\mod 20 = 9\\). Then \\(3^9 \\mod 25 = 8\\).
   - Combine results using Chinese Remainder Theorem: \\(x \\equiv 3 \\mod 4\\) and \\(x \\equiv 8 \\mod 25\\) gives \\(x = 83 \\mod 100\\).

Thus, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\(\\boxed{83}\\).

<|end_of_solution|>

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, so I need to find the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\). Hmm, last two digits usually means modulo 100, right? So I need to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100\\). Alright, let's break this down step by step.

First, Euler's theorem might be useful here. Euler's theorem states that if a and n are coprime, then \\(a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\mod n\\). Since 3 and 100 are coprime, we can apply this. The totient function \\(\\phi(100)\\) is calculated as follows: 100 factors into \\(2^2 \\times 5^2\\), so \\(\\phi(100) = 100 \\times (1 - 1/2) \\times (1 - 1/5) = 100 \\times 1/2 \\times 4/5 = 40\\). So \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{40} \\equiv 1 \\mod 100\\). That means the exponent of 3 can be reduced modulo 40. So, \\(3^{3^{2014}} \\mod 100 = 3^{(3^{2014} \\mod 40)} \\mod 100\\).

Now, I need to compute \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40\\). Let's tackle that. Again, using Euler's theorem, since 3 and 40 are coprime, \\(\\phi(40)\\) will help. The prime factors of 40 are \\(2^3 \\times 5\\), so \\(\\phi(40) = 40 \\times (1 - 1/2) \\times (1 - 1/5) = 40 \\times 1/2 \\times 4/5 = 16\\). So \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\), which means \\(3^{16} \\equiv 1 \\mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} \\mod 40 = 3^{(2014 \\mod 16)} \\mod 40\\).

Calculating \\(2014 \\mod 16\\): 16 × 125 = 2000, so 2014 - 2000 = 14. Therefore, \\(2014 \\mod 16 = 14\\). So now we need to compute \\(3^{14} \\mod 40\\).

Let's compute \\(3^{14}\\) step by step. But maybe there's a smarter way. Let's see:

First, compute \\(3^1 \\mod 40 = 3\\)
\\(3^2 = 9 \\mod 40\\)
\\(3^3 = 27 \\mod 40\\)
\\(3^4 = 81 \\mod 40 = 81 - 2×40 = 1\\)
Oh, that's a cycle. Wait, \\(3^4 ≡ 1 mod 40\\). So the cycle length here is 4? That's interesting. So since \\(3^4 ≡ 1 mod 40\\), then \\(3^{14}\\) can be written as \\(3^{4×3 + 2} = (3^4)^3 × 3^2 ≡ 1^3 × 9 ≡ 9 mod 40\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} ≡ 9 mod 40\\).

Therefore, going back to the original problem: \\(3^{3^{2014}} ≡ 3^9 mod 100\\). So now we need to compute \\(3^9 mod 100\\).

Calculating \\(3^9\\):

\\(3^1 = 3\\)
\\(3^2 = 9\\)
\\(3^3 = 27\\)
\\(3^4 = 81\\)
\\(3^5 = 243 mod 100 = 43\\)
\\(3^6 = 129 mod 100 = 29\\)
\\(3^7 = 87\\)
\\(3^8 = 261 mod 100 = 61\\)
\\(3^9 = 183 mod 100 = 83\\)

So \\(3^9 ≡ 83 mod 100\\). Therefore, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) should be 83.

Wait, but let me verify the steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, \\(\\phi(100) = 40\\), so exponents of 3 can be reduced modulo 40. Then, \\(3^{2014} mod 40\\). To compute that, \\(\\phi(40) = 16\\), so exponents of 3 can be reduced modulo 16. But 2014 mod 16 is 14, so \\(3^{14} mod 40\\). Then, since \\(3^4 ≡ 1 mod 40\\), 14 divided by 4 is 3 with a remainder of 2, so \\(3^{14} ≡ (3^4)^3 × 3^2 ≡ 1^3 × 9 ≡ 9 mod 40\\). Therefore, exponent is 9. Then \\(3^9 mod 100 = 83\\). That seems right.

Wait, but let me check \\(3^4 mod 40\\). \\(3^4 = 81, 81 mod 40 is 1. Yes, correct. So \\(3^4 ≡ 1 mod 40\\), so cycle length is 4. Therefore, \\(3^{14} = 3^{4×3 + 2} = (3^4)^3 × 3^2 ≡ 1^3 × 9 ≡ 9 mod 40\\). Correct. Then \\(3^9 mod 100\\). Let's compute \\(3^9\\) step by step again:

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27

3^4 = 81

3^5 = 81 × 3 = 243 → 43

3^6 = 43 × 3 = 129 → 29

3^7 = 29 × 3 = 87

3^8 = 87 × 3 = 261 → 61

3^9 = 61 × 3 = 183 → 83. Yes, that's correct. So 83 is the result. Therefore, the last two digits are 83.

But let me think again if there's another way to approach this, maybe using Chinese Remainder Theorem? Since 100 is 4×25, and 4 and 25 are coprime. So compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} mod 4\\) and \\(3^{3^{2014}} mod 25\\), then combine them.

First, mod 4: 3 ≡ -1 mod 4, so \\(3^{3^{2014}} ≡ (-1)^{3^{2014}} mod 4\\). Since 3^{2014} is odd, because 3 is odd and any power of odd is odd. So exponent is odd, so (-1)^odd = -1 ≡ 3 mod 4. So the result is 3 mod 4.

Now mod 25: Let's compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} mod 25\\). Euler's theorem: \\(\\phi(25) = 20\\), so \\(3^{20} ≡ 1 mod 25\\). So we need to compute \\(3^{2014} mod 20\\), since the exponent is 3^{2014}.

Wait, no. Wait, the exponent here is \\(3^{2014}\\), so to compute \\(3^{3^{2014}} mod 25\\), we can write it as \\(3^{(3^{2014} mod 20)} mod 25\\). So first compute \\(3^{2014} mod 20\\).

To compute \\(3^{2014} mod 20\\), again using Euler's theorem. \\(\\phi(20) = 8\\), so \\(3^8 ≡ 1 mod 20\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} mod 20 = 3^{(2014 mod 8)} mod 20\\).

2014 divided by 8: 8×251=2008, so 2014-2008=6. Therefore, \\(2014 mod 8=6\\). So \\(3^6 mod 20\\).

Compute \\(3^6\\):

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27 mod 20 = 7

3^4 = 21 mod 20 = 1

3^5 = 3

3^6 = 9

So \\(3^6 ≡ 9 mod 20\\). Therefore, \\(3^{2014} ≡ 9 mod 20\\). Therefore, \\(3^{3^{2014}} ≡ 3^9 mod 25\\).

Compute \\(3^9 mod 25\\):

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27 mod 25 = 2

3^4 = 6

3^5 = 18

3^6 = 54 mod 25 = 4

3^7 = 12

3^8 = 36 mod 25 = 11

3^9 = 33 mod 25 = 8

Wait, so \\(3^9 ≡ 8 mod 25\\). So now we have:

\\(3^{3^{2014}} ≡ 3 mod 4\\) and \\(8 mod 25\\). Now we need to find a number x such that:

x ≡ 3 mod 4

x ≡ 8 mod 25

To solve this system using Chinese Remainder Theorem.

Let’s find x such that x = 25k + 8, and 25k + 8 ≡ 3 mod 4.

25 mod 4 is 1, so 25k mod 4 is k. Therefore:

k + 8 ≡ 3 mod 4

k ≡ 3 - 8 mod 4

k ≡ -5 mod 4

k ≡ -1 mod 4

k ≡ 3 mod 4

Therefore, k = 4m + 3 for some integer m. Therefore, x = 25*(4m + 3) + 8 = 100m + 75 + 8 = 100m + 83. Therefore, the smallest positive solution is 83 mod 100. Which matches our previous result. So that's reassuring.

Therefore, the last two digits are 83. So both methods lead to the same answer, so that gives me confidence.

But just to be thorough, let me check once again with another approach. Maybe using lifting the exponent lemma (LTE) or something else, but I don't think LTE is applicable here since we're dealing with modulus 100, which is not a prime power. Wait, 100 is 2^2 × 5^2. So maybe we can compute modulo 4 and 25 and combine, which is what we did earlier. But since that worked, and mod 4 gave us 3 and mod 25 gave us 8, leading to 83 mod 100, that's probably solid.

Alternatively, perhaps compute \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) using the Chinese Remainder Theorem as done, but since both methods agree, 83 is the correct answer.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me check the calculation of \\(3^9 mod 25\\) once again. Let's compute \\(3^9\\):

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27 mod 25 = 2

3^4 = 3*2 = 6

3^5 = 18

3^6 = 54 mod 25 = 54 - 2*25 = 4

3^7 = 12

3^8 = 36 mod 25 = 11

3^9 = 33 mod 25 = 8. Yes, that's correct. So 8 mod 25. Then combining with mod 4 gives 83.

Alternatively, if I compute \\(3^9\\) directly:

3^1 = 3

3^2 = 9

3^3 = 27

3^4 = 81

3^5 = 243 → 43

3^6 = 129 → 29

3^7 = 87

3^8 = 261 → 61

3^9 = 183 → 83. Again, 83 mod 100. So all methods confirm that.

Therefore, the last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are 83.

**Final Answer**
The last two digits of \\(3^{3^{2014}}\\) are \\boxed{83}.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx \\) and express it in terms of the constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we start by rewriting \\( x^x \\) as \\( e^{x \\ln x} \\). Using the Taylor series expansion for \\( e^y \\), we substitute \\( y = x \\ln x \\) to get:

\\[

Assuming uniform convergence, we interchange the integral and the summation:

\\[

Using the substitution \\( t = -\\ln x \\) (which transforms \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\)), the integral becomes:

\\[

","Alright, let me try to figure out how to evaluate the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx and express it in terms of the constants A and B given. Hmm, okay, so first, I need to recall what A and B are. 

A is defined as the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n^n, right? So A = 1/1¹ + 1/2² + 1/3³ + 1/4⁴ + ... Similarly, B is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/(2n)^{2n}, which is 1/2² + 1/4⁴ + 1/6⁶ + ... So B is like taking the terms of A but only the even ones, each divided by 2^{2n} instead of n^{n}. Wait, actually, no. Let me check: if n starts at 1, then B is 1/(2*1)^{2*1} + 1/(2*2)^{2*2} + ... which is 1/2² + 1/4⁴ + 1/6⁶ + ..., so each term is 1/(2k)^{2k} where k is from 1 to infinity. That makes sense.

Now, the integral in question is ∫₀¹ x^x dx. I remember that x^x can be written as e^{x ln x}, right? So, x^x = e^{x ln x}. That might be useful for expanding the function into a series. Maybe a Taylor series or a power series expansion?

Let me recall that for some functions, especially those involving exponentials of polynomials, we can use the Taylor series expansion. But x^x is not a polynomial; it's an exponential function with a variable exponent. Hmm. Wait, perhaps I can use the identity x^x = e^{x ln x} and then expand e^{x ln x} into a power series. 

The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from n=0 to infinity of y^n / n!. So substituting y = x ln x, we get x^x = sum_{n=0}^infty (x ln x)^n / n!. Therefore, the integral becomes the integral from 0 to 1 of sum_{n=0}^infty (x ln x)^n / n! dx. 

Assuming that we can interchange the summation and integration (which I think we can by uniform convergence or dominated convergence theorem), we can write this as sum_{n=0}^infty [1/n! ∫₀¹ (x ln x)^n dx]. So now, the problem reduces to evaluating the integral ∫₀¹ (x ln x)^n dx for each n, and then summing up these results multiplied by 1/n!.

Let me focus on evaluating ∫₀¹ (x ln x)^n dx. Let's make a substitution here. Let me set t = -ln x. Then, when x approaches 0 from the right, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So, x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{∞}^{0} (e^{-t} * (-t))^n (-e^{-t} dt). Simplifying the limits and the negative signs: ∫₀^∞ (e^{-t} * (-t))^n e^{-t} dt. 

Wait, (x ln x)^n = (e^{-t} * (-t))^n = e^{-n t} * (-t)^n. But since we have an even power if n is even, but actually, x ln x is negative on (0,1), so (x ln x)^n would be positive if n is even and negative if n is odd. However, when we take the integral, the negative signs might cancel out depending on n. But perhaps since we are dealing with exponents, we can write it as (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t} * e^{-t} dt. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ (-1)^n t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt. 

But since (-1)^n is just a constant factor, we can take it out of the integral. So ∫₀^∞ (-1)^n t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt = (-1)^n ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt. Now, this integral is similar to the Gamma function. Recall that ∫₀^∞ t^k e^{-at} dt = Gamma(k+1)/a^{k+1}, provided that Re(a) > 0. In this case, a = n + 1, and k = n. So the integral becomes (-1)^n * Gamma(n + 1) / (n + 1)^{n + 1}.

But Gamma(n + 1) is equal to n! for non-negative integer n. Therefore, ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt = n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}. Therefore, our original integral ∫₀¹ (x ln x)^n dx = (-1)^n * n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check the substitution steps again. Starting from x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then, (x ln x)^n = (e^{-t} * (-t))^n = (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t}. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t} * e^{-t} dt = (-1)^n ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-(n + 1)t} dt. Then, as above, that integral is n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}. So indeed, ∫₀¹ (x ln x)^n dx = (-1)^n n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}.

Therefore, going back to the original integral, ∫₀¹ x^x dx = sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/n! * (-1)^n n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}] = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (n + 1)^{n + 1}.

Simplifying the indices, let's reindex the sum. Let k = n + 1. Then, when n = 0, k = 1, and as n approaches infinity, so does k. So the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^k. Therefore, the integral is equal to sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^k.

Now, how can we express this sum in terms of A and B? Let's recall that A is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k, which is exactly the same as the sum we have here but without the alternating signs. So, A = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k. Similarly, B is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/( (2k)^{2k} ). Let's see.

Our sum is sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k. Let's split this into even and odd terms. Let's separate the sum into two parts: terms where k is odd and terms where k is even.

For even k: Let k = 2m. Then, when k is even, (-1)^{k - 1} = (-1)^{2m - 1} = (-1)^{-1} = -1. So the even terms contribute sum_{m=1}^∞ (-1)/ (2m)^{2m} = - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} = -B.

For odd k: Let k = 2m - 1. Then, (-1)^{k - 1} = (-1)^{2m - 2} = (-1)^{2(m - 1)} = 1. So the odd terms contribute sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1}. But note that sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k = A. Therefore, sum_{k odd} 1/k^k = A - sum_{k even} 1/k^k. The sum over even k is sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} = B. Therefore, sum_{k odd} 1/k^k = A - B. Therefore, the odd terms in our original sum are (A - B).

Putting it all together, the original sum is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, the sum is [sum over odd k] + [sum over even k] = (A - B) + (-B) = A - 2B. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx = sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k = A - 2B.

But let me verify this step again. So, the original sum is sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k. Split into even and odd k:

Sum_{k odd} (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k + sum_{k even} (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k

For even k: Let k = 2m. Then, (-1)^{2m - 1} = (-1)^{-1} = -1. So sum_{m=1}^∞ (-1)/ (2m)^{2m} = - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} = -B.

For odd k: Let k = 2m - 1. Then, (-1)^{2m - 2} = 1. So sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} = sum_{k odd} 1/k^k = A - sum_{k even} 1/k^k = A - B.

Therefore, total sum is (A - B) + (-B) = A - 2B. So the integral is equal to A - 2B. Therefore, ∫₀¹ x^x dx = A - 2B.

Wait, but let me check if this makes sense. Let's compute the numerical values. The integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx is a known constant, approximately 0.78343... Let me compute A and B:

A = 1/1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + ... ≈ 1 + 0.25 + 0.037037... + 0.00390625 + ... ≈ around 1.291285... 

B = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/157464 + ... ≈ 0.25 + 0.00390625 + 0.00000637... ≈ around 0.2539126...

Then, A - 2B ≈ 1.291285 - 2*0.2539126 ≈ 1.291285 - 0.507825 ≈ 0.78346, which is close to the known value of approximately 0.78343. The slight discrepancy is due to truncation of the series. So this seems to check out.

Therefore, the answer is A - 2B. However, the problem statement mentions expressing the answer in terms of A and B. The given constants are:

A = 1/1¹ + 1/2² + 1/3³ + ... = sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^n

B = 1/2² + 1/4⁴ + 1/6⁶ + ... = sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2n)^{2n}

Therefore, the integral is equal to A - 2B. Therefore, the answer is A - 2B, which is equal to the sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k.

But let me check again the reindexing step. When I reindexed the sum from n=0 to k=1, sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k. Then splitting into even and odd terms, which leads to A - 2B. Yes, that seems correct. 

Alternatively, another way to see this is that the sum A is the sum over all k ≥ 1 of 1/k^k, and B is the sum over even k ≥ 1 of 1/k^k. Therefore, the sum over odd k is A - B. Then, our original sum is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. That's another way to write it. 

So, the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx is equal to A - 2B, which matches the numerical approximation. Therefore, the answer should be A - 2B.

**Final Answer**
The value of the integral is \\boxed{A - 2B}.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 and express it in terms of the constants A and B, which are given by those series. Hmm, x^x is a tricky function because it's not straightforward to integrate. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that x^x can be rewritten using exponential functions. Specifically, x^x = e^{x ln x}. Maybe expanding this into a Taylor series would help? That's a common technique for integrals of functions like x^x. The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from n=0 to infinity of y^n / n!, so substituting y = x ln x, we get:

x^x = e^{x ln x} = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n!

But integrating this directly might not be straightforward because of the ln x term. Wait, maybe I should consider expanding x^x as a series in powers of x and then integrating term by term? Let me see.

Alternatively, I recall that there's a special function called the sophomore's dream which relates to integrating x^x. The integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx is equal to the sum from n=1 to infinity of (-1)^{n+1} / (n^n). Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Yes, I think the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx = Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} / n^n. So that's a known result. But the problem here wants the answer expressed in terms of A and B. Let me look at what A and B are.

A is given by 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ..., which is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n^n. Similarly, B is 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ..., which is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/(2n)^{2n} = Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(2n)^{2n} = Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/(4^n n^{2n}).

But the integral is given by Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. So that's an alternating series. Let's see if we can express this in terms of A and B. A is the sum of all positive terms 1/n^n, and B is the sum of terms 1/(2n)^{2n}, which is part of A? Wait, no. Let me think.

If I split the sum A into even and odd terms, maybe I can relate it to B. Let's see:

A = Σ_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^n = Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k}

So the odd terms are Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} and the even terms are Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k} = B. So A = (A - B) + B, which checks out. But how does this help with the integral?

The integral is Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. Let's write this out for the first few terms:

1/1^1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 - 1/4^4 + 1/5^5 - 1/6^6 + ... 

Notice that the even terms are negative. Let's separate the sum into odd and even terms:

= [1/1^1 + 1/3^3 + 1/5^5 + ...] - [1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ...]

The first part is the sum of 1/(2k+1)^{2k+1} for k starting from 0, and the second part is the sum of 1/(2k)^{2k} for k starting from 1. Wait, but A is the sum of all 1/n^n. So the sum of odd terms is A - B, because A includes both odd and even terms, and the even terms are B. Therefore, the sum of odd terms is A - B. Then the integral becomes (A - B) - B = A - 2B. Wait, is that right?

Wait, let's check:

Original integral sum: Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n^n = Σ_{k=0}^∞ [1/(2k+1)^{2k+1} - 1/(2k+2)^{2k+2}]

Which can be written as Σ_{k=0}^∞ 1/(2k+1)^{2k+1} - Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k}

The first sum is A - B, since A is the sum over all n, and subtracting B (the sum over even terms) leaves the sum over odd terms. The second sum is Σ_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k} = B. Therefore, the integral is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. So that's the expression in terms of A and B.

Wait, but let me verify this with the initial terms. For example, if A = 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + ... and B = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/15625 + ..., then A - 2B would be 1 + (1/4 - 1/4) + (1/27 - 1/27) + (1/256 - 1/256) + ... which is 1. But the integral is 1 - 1/4 + 1/27 - 1/256 + ... which is not 1. So clearly, my reasoning is flawed here.

Wait, hold on. The integral is Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. Let's compute the first few terms:

n=1: (-1)^{2}/1^1 = 1

n=2: (-1)^3/2^2 = -1/4

n=3: (-1)^4/3^3 = 1/27

n=4: (-1)^5/4^4 = -1/256

So the sum is 1 - 1/4 + 1/27 - 1/256 + 1/3125 - ... 

But A is 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + ..., so the integral's sum is 1 - (1/4 - 1/27 + 1/256 - ...). Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, if I consider that the positive terms are the odd terms and the negative terms are the even terms:

Integral = Σ_{k=0}^\\infty [1/(2k+1)^{2k+1}] - Σ_{k=1}^\\infty [1/(2k)^{2k}]

Which is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. But when I compute A - 2B, using A = 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + ... and B = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/15625 + ..., then A - 2B = 1 + (1/4 - 2*1/4) + (1/27 - 2*1/27) + (1/256 - 2*1/256) + ... = 1 - 0 - 0 - 0 - ... = 1. But the integral is not 1. So clearly, that can't be right.

Wait, so there's a mistake here. Let me think again. The integral is Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. Let's separate the sum into odd and even terms:

For n odd: n = 2k + 1, so terms are (+1)^{2k+2}/(2k+1)^{2k+1} = 1/(2k+1)^{2k+1}

For n even: n = 2k, so terms are (-1)^{2k+1}/(2k)^{2k} = -1/(2k)^{2k}

Therefore, the sum is Σ_{k=0}^\\infty 1/(2k+1)^{2k+1} - Σ_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}

The first sum is the sum over odd n of 1/n^n, which is A - B, since A is the sum over all n and B is the sum over even n. The second sum is Σ_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = B. Therefore, the integral is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. But when I compute A - 2B, as I tried earlier, it seems to not match the actual value of the integral. Wait, but maybe the problem is that A and B are defined differently here.

Wait, let's check the definitions again:

A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ... = Σ_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^n

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ... = Σ_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}

So A - 2B would be [Σ_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^n] - 2[Σ_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}]

Let me compute A - 2B:

= [1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + ...] - 2[1/4 + 1/256 + 1/15625 + ...]

= 1 + (1/4 - 2/4) + (1/27 - 0) + (1/256 - 2/256) + (1/3125 - 0) + ...

= 1 - 1/4 + 1/27 - 1/256 + 1/3125 - ...

Which is exactly the series for the integral! So that works. So even though A - 2B seems to collapse to 1 when I thought incorrectly, when written out term by term, it does match the integral's series. Therefore, the integral is indeed equal to A - 2B.

But let me verify with a numerical approximation. Let's compute the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx numerically. I know that this integral is approximately 0.7834305107 (from memory or calculation). Let me compute A and B numerically as well.

First, compute A:

A = 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + 1/46656 + 1/823543 + ...

Compute the first few terms:

1 + 0.25 = 1.25

+ 0.037037 ≈ 1.287037

+ 0.00390625 ≈ 1.290943

+ 0.00032 ≈ 1.291263

+ 0.000032 ≈ 1.291295

+ 0.000002143347 ≈ 1.291297

So A ≈ 1.291297

Now compute B:

B = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/15625 + 1/46656 + 1/16777216 + ...

First few terms:

0.25 + 0.00390625 ≈ 0.25390625

+ 0.000064 ≈ 0.25397025

+ 0.0000216 ≈ 0.2540, and so on. So B ≈ 0.2540

Therefore, A - 2B ≈ 1.291297 - 2*0.2540 ≈ 1.291297 - 0.5080 ≈ 0.783297, which is close to the known value of approximately 0.7834305. The slight discrepancy is due to truncation of the series. Therefore, the expression A - 2B is indeed the correct value of the integral.

Therefore, the answer is A - 2B, which can be written as A - 2B. So the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx equals A - 2B.

**Final Answer**
The value of the integral is \\boxed{A - 2B}.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx \\) and express it in terms of the constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we start by rewriting \\( x^x \\) as \\( e^{x \\ln x} \\). Using the Taylor series expansion for \\( e^y \\), we substitute \\( y = x \\ln x \\) to get:

\\[

\\[

Using the substitution \\( t = -\\ln x \\) (which transforms \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\)), the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx = (-1)^n \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-t(n+1)} \\, dt

Thus, the integral becomes:

This simplifies to \\( A - 2B \\), as the odd terms contribute \\( A - B \\) and the even terms contribute \\( -B \\). Therefore, the value of the integral is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 and express it in terms of the constants A and B, where A is the sum of 1/(1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ...) and B is the sum of 1/(2^2 + 4^4 + 6^6 + ...). Hmm, let's start by recalling what x^x is. I know that x^x can be rewritten using exponentials: x^x = e^{x ln x}. Maybe expanding this into a Taylor series would help?

The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from n=0 to infinity of y^n / n!. So substituting y = x ln x, we get x^x = sum_{n=0}^infty (x ln x)^n / n!. Then, the integral becomes the integral from 0 to 1 of sum_{n=0}^infty (x ln x)^n / n! dx. If I can interchange the integral and the summation, which I think is allowed under uniform convergence, then we can write this as sum_{n=0}^infty 1/n! integral from 0 to 1 of (x ln x)^n dx.

Now, the challenge is to compute the integral of (x ln x)^n from 0 to 1. Let me focus on this integral. Let's consider substitution. Let t = -ln x, so x = e^{-t}, and when x=0, t approaches infinity, and when x=1, t=0. Then dx = -e^{-t} dt. So the integral becomes integral from t=infty to t=0 of (e^{-t} * (-t))^n * (-e^{-t} dt). Simplifying, the minus signs cancel, and we get integral from 0 to infty of (e^{-t} * (-t))^n * e^{-t} dt = integral from 0 to infty of (-1)^n t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt.

Since (-1)^n t^n is just (-t)^n, but squared it would be t^n, but the (-1)^n factor remains. However, since we're integrating from 0 to infinity, and the integrand is t^n e^{-(n+1)t}, multiplied by (-1)^n. Let's factor out the (-1)^n: (-1)^n integral from 0 to infty t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt. Let me make a substitution here. Let u = (n+1)t, then t = u/(n+1), dt = du/(n+1). The integral becomes (-1)^n integral from 0 to infty (u/(n+1))^n e^{-u} * du/(n+1) = (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1} integral from 0 to infty u^n e^{-u} du.

The integral of u^n e^{-u} du from 0 to infty is the Gamma function Gamma(n+1), which is n! for integer n >=0. So substituting back, the integral becomes (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1} * n! Therefore, the original integral of x^x from 0 to1 is sum_{n=0}^\\infty 1/n! * (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1} * n! = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1}.

Wait, that simplifies to sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n-1} / n^n because if I let k = n+1, then when n=0, k=1, so sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1} / k^k. So the integral is sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1} / k^k. Let me check this again.

Yes, substituting k = n+1, so n = k-1. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1} / k^k. That's an alternating series where each term is (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Let's see if this series can be expressed in terms of A and B. The problem defines A as the sum of 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ..., which is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k. Similarly, B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(4k^2 * k^{2k}) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2^{2k} k^{2k}) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty (1/2^{2k}) / k^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty (1/4^k)/k^{2k}.

But our integral is sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Let's split this sum into even and odd terms. Let's separate the sum into terms where k is odd and k is even. For k odd: let's set k = 2m -1, so m starts from 1. Then the term is (-1)^{(2m-1)-1}/(2m-1)^{2m-1} = (-1)^{2m -2}/(2m-1)^{2m-1} = (1)^{m -1}/(2m-1)^{2m-1} = 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1}. For k even: k = 2m, so term is (-1)^{2m -1}/(2m)^{2m} = (-1)^{2m -1}/(2m)^{2m} = (-1)^{2m}/(2m)^{2m} * (-1) = (1)/(2m)^{2m} * (-1). So the sum becomes sum_{m=1}^\\infty [1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}]. 

Therefore, the integral is equal to sum_{m=1}^\\infty [1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}]. Let's relate this to A and B. A is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k. If we separate A into odd and even terms: sum_{k odd} 1/k^k + sum_{k even} 1/k^k. The sum over odd k is sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1}, and the sum over even k is sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2^{2m} m^{2m}) = sum_{m=1}^\\infty (1/4^m)/m^{2m} = B. Wait, but B is defined as sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(4^k k^{2k}) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty (1/4^k)/k^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(4^k k^{2k}). Wait, but the sum over even k in A is sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2^{2m} m^{2m}) = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(4^m m^{2m}) = sum_{m=1}^\\infty (1/4^m)/m^{2m}. However, B is defined as sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(4^k k^{2k}), which is exactly the same as the sum over even terms in A. Therefore, sum_{k even} 1/k^k = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = B. Therefore, the sum over odd terms in A is A - B.

But in our integral expression, we have sum_{m=1}^\\infty [1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}] = (A - B) - B = A - 2B. Wait, because sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} is the sum over odd terms in A, which is A - B, and sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} is B. Therefore, the integral is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. So the integral from 0 to1 of x^x dx equals A - 2B.

But let me verify this step again. The original sum was sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Splitting into even and odd terms:

For odd k: k = 2m -1, term is 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1}
For even k: k=2m, term is -1/(2m)^{2m}

Thus, sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{m=1}^\\infty [1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}].

Now, sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} is the sum over odd k terms in A, which is A - sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = A - B. Then subtract sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} which is B. Therefore, total is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. So yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the integral is equal to A - 2B. Let me check if this makes sense with known values. I recall that A is approximately 1.291285997... and B is approximately 0.364084511... So A - 2B ≈ 1.291285997 - 2*0.364084511 ≈ 1.291285997 - 0.728169022 ≈ 0.563116975. I know that the integral of x^x from 0 to1 is approximately 0.78343, wait, that's conflicting. Wait, maybe my approximations for A and B are wrong.

Wait, let me check the values. Let's compute A and B numerically. A is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k. Let's compute the first few terms:

1/1^1 = 1

1/2^2 = 1/4 = 0.25

1/3^3 ≈ 1/27 ≈ 0.037037

1/4^4 = 1/256 ≈ 0.00390625

1/5^5 ≈ 0.00032

Adding these: 1 + 0.25 = 1.25; +0.037037 ≈1.287037; +0.00390625≈1.290943; +0.00032≈1.291263. So A is approximately 1.291285997, as given. Then B is the sum over even k of 1/k^k, which is 1/2^2 +1/4^4 +1/6^6 +... Let's compute:

1/2^2 = 1/4 = 0.25

1/4^4 = 1/256 ≈0.00390625

1/6^6 ≈1/46656≈0.000021433

So sum is approximately 0.25 +0.00390625≈0.25390625 +0.000021433≈0.253927683. So B≈0.253927683.

Therefore, A - 2B ≈1.291285997 - 2*0.253927683≈1.291285997 -0.507855366≈0.78343. Which matches the approximate value of the integral of x^x from 0 to1, which is indeed approximately 0.78343. Therefore, the answer must be A - 2B.

Therefore, the integral from 0 to1 of x^x dx equals A - 2B. So the final answer is \\boxed{A - 2B}.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of x^x from 0 to 1, and express the answer in terms of these constants A and B. Let me start by recalling what x^x actually is. Hmm, x^x can be rewritten using the exponential function and logarithm, right? So x^x = e^{x ln x}. That might help in integrating it. 

Wait, integrating e^{x ln x} directly seems complicated. Maybe I can expand this function into a series and then integrate term by term. I remember that sometimes functions like this can be expressed as a power series, and if the series converges uniformly, I can interchange the integral and the summation. Let me think about how to expand x^x.

Starting with x^x = e^{x ln x}, I can use the Taylor series expansion for e^y, where y = x ln x. The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from n=0 to infinity of y^n / n!. So substituting y, we get:

x^x = sum_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n!

But integrating this term by term might not be straightforward because ln x is involved. Let me check if there's another approach. Maybe expanding ln x as a series? But ln x is undefined at x=0, which is part of the integral's limits. Hmm, tricky.

Wait, perhaps there's a known series expansion for x^x. Let me recall. I think x^x can be expressed as a sum involving the Riemann zeta function or something related to series expansions. Alternatively, maybe integrating by parts?

Let me try integrating by parts. Let u = x^x and dv = dx. Then du would be derivative of x^x times dx, and v = x. But what is the derivative of x^x? Using the chain rule, (x^x)' = x^x (ln x + 1). So integrating by parts:

∫ x^x dx = x * x^x - ∫ x * x^x (ln x + 1) dx

But that seems more complicated because now we have another integral that's similar but with an extra ln x term. Maybe that's not helpful. Let me backtrack.

Another idea: express x^x as a series in terms of x. Wait, x^x is like x multiplied by x^{x-1}, but that might not help. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that x^x = e^{x ln x} and expand ln x into a series?

Wait, ln x can be expressed as a series around a certain point, but around x=1 perhaps? Let me see. The expansion of ln x around x=1 is ln(1 + (x-1)) = (x-1) - (x-1)^2 / 2 + (x-1)^3 / 3 - ... But integrating from 0 to 1, maybe not so helpful.

Alternatively, use substitution. Let me try substituting t = -ln x. Then when x=0, t approaches infinity, and when x=1, t=0. So dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes:

∫_{0}^{1} x^x dx = ∫_{infty}^{0} (e^{-t})^{e^{-t}} (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫_{0}^{\\infty} (e^{-t})^{e^{-t}} e^{-t} dt

Simplify the integrand: (e^{-t})^{e^{-t}} = e^{-t e^{-t}}. So the integral becomes:

∫_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-t e^{-t}} e^{-t} dt = ∫_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-t - t e^{-t}} dt

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe another substitution? Let me try u = t e^{-t}. Then du/dt = e^{-t} - t e^{-t} = e^{-t}(1 - t). But I don't see how that would help here. Maybe this substitution isn't useful.

Wait, perhaps expanding e^{-t e^{-t}} as a series? Let's see. Let me write e^{-t e^{-t}} = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-t e^{-t})^n / n! Then integrate term by term:

∫_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-t} sum_{n=0}^∞ (-t e^{-t})^n / n! dt = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / n! ∫_{0}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-t(n+1)} dt

Ah, this seems promising. Let's compute each integral. The integral ∫_{0}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-a t} dt is known as the Gamma function, Gamma(n+1)/a^{n+1} = n! / a^{n+1}. Here, a = n+1. So each term becomes:

(-1)^n / n! * n! / (n+1)^{n+1} } = (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1}

Therefore, the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1} } = sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1} / k^k } where k = n+1.

So the original integral ∫_{0}^{1} x^x dx = sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1} / k^k }

But wait, the problem mentions expressing the answer in terms of A and B, where A is the sum 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ... and B is the sum 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ... So A is the sum of 1/k^k for k=1 to infinity, and B is the sum of 1/(2k)^{2k} for k=1 to infinity.

But the integral here is the alternating sum: 1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 - 1/4^4 + ... So how can we express this in terms of A and B?

Note that A = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k

If we consider the alternating sum, it's like A minus twice the sum of the even terms. Let's see:

sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/k^k - 2*(1/(2k)^{2k})] ?

Wait, let's check:

Original sum: 1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 - 1/4^4 + 1/5^5 - 1/6^6 + ... 

Which can be written as (1 + 1/3^3 + 1/5^5 + ...) - (1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ...)

But A is 1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + 1/4^4 + ... So the alternating sum is (A - B) - B = A - 2B?

Wait, let me verify:

If A = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k

Then the sum of odd terms is A - sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k} } = A - B

Similarly, the sum of even terms is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k} } = B

Therefore, the alternating sum is (A - B) - B = A - 2B

Yes, that's correct. Therefore, the integral ∫_{0}^{1} x^x dx = A - 2B

But let me confirm this once again. The integral equals the alternating sum, which is equal to (sum of odd terms) - (sum of even terms). The sum of odd terms is A minus the sum of even terms (which is B). Therefore, (A - B) - B = A - 2B. Yes, that seems right.

Therefore, the answer should be A - 2B. Let me check with some references. Wait, I recall that this integral is a known series and sometimes expressed in terms of these constants. But let me verify the steps again.

Starting from x^x = e^{x ln x}, expanding into a series, integrating term by term, which led to the alternating sum. Then expressing that sum in terms of A and B. The key step was recognizing that the alternating sum is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. That seems correct.

Another way to see it: the sum S = 1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 - 1/4^4 + 1/5^5 - 1/6^6 + ... 

Grouping terms: (1 + 1/3^3 + 1/5^5 + ...) - (1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ...) 

The first part is all terms of A with odd k, which is A - B (since B is the sum of even terms). The second part is B. Therefore, S = (A - B) - B = A - 2B. Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the value of the integral is A - 2B.

**Final Answer**
The value of the integral is \\boxed{A - 2B}.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx \\) and express it in terms of the constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we start by rewriting \\( x^x \\) as \\( e^{x \\ln x} \\). Using the Taylor series expansion for \\( e^y \\), we substitute \\( y = x \\ln x \\) to get:

\\[
x^x = e^{x \\ln x} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!}
\\]

Substituting this into the integral, we have:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!} \\, dx
\\]

Assuming uniform convergence, we interchange the integral and the summation:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx
\\]

Using the substitution \\( t = -\\ln x \\) (which transforms \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\)), the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx = (-1)^n \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-t(n+1)} \\, dt
\\]

Further substitution \\( u = t(n+1) \\) leads to:

\\[
(-1)^n \\frac{1}{(n+1)^{n+1}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^n e^{-u} \\, du = (-1)^n \\frac{n!}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Reindexing with \\( k = n + 1 \\), we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^k}
\\]

This series can be split into even and odd terms. Recognizing \\( A \\) as the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{k^k} \\) for all \\( k \\geq 1 \\) and \\( B \\) as the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{(2k)^{2k}} \\) for all \\( k \\geq 1 \\), we find:

This simplifies to \\( A - 2B \\), as the odd terms contribute \\( A - B \\) and the even terms contribute \\( -B \\). Therefore, the value of the integral is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 and express the answer in terms of the constants A and B. Hmm, x^x is a tricky function because it's not an elementary function. I remember that sometimes integrals of x^x can be expressed using series expansions. Let me think.

First, I know that x^x can be rewritten using the exponential function. Since x^x = e^{x ln x}. So maybe I can expand e^{x ln x} into a Taylor series. The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from n=0 to infinity of y^n / n!. So substituting y = x ln x, we get:

x^x = e^{x ln x} = sum_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n!

Then, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx would be the integral from 0 to 1 of sum_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n! dx.

Assuming uniform convergence, I can interchange the integral and the sum:

Integral = sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/n! * integral_{0}^1 x^n (ln x)^n dx]

Now, the challenge is to compute the integral of x^n (ln x)^n dx from 0 to 1. Let me recall that integrals of the form integral x^m (ln x)^k dx can be evaluated using substitution. Let me try substituting t = -ln x. Then, when x = 1, t = 0; when x = 0, t = infinity. Also, x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes:

integral_{0}^1 x^n (ln x)^n dx = integral_{infty}^0 (e^{-t})^n (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt) = integral_{0}^infty e^{-t(n+1)} t^n dt

Wait, let's check that again. Let me do substitution step by step.

Let t = -ln x => x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. So:

x^n = e^{-nt}, ln x = -t, (ln x)^n = (-t)^n. Therefore:

Integral becomes:

integral_{x=0}^{x=1} x^n (ln x)^n dx = integral_{t=infty}^{t=0} e^{-nt}*(-t)^n*(-e^{-t} dt)

Simplify the expression:

= integral_{t=0}^{t=infty} e^{-nt}*(-t)^n*e^{-t} dt

= integral_{0}^infty e^{-(n+1)t}*(-t)^n dt

But (-t)^n = (-1)^n t^n. So:

= (-1)^n integral_{0}^infty t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt

Now, let’s make a substitution: let u = t(n+1), so t = u/(n+1), dt = du/(n+1). Then:

= (-1)^n integral_{0}^infty (u/(n+1))^n e^{-u} * du/(n+1)

= (-1)^n (1/(n+1)^{n+1}) integral_{0}^infty u^n e^{-u} du

The integral of u^n e^{-u} du from 0 to infinity is the Gamma function Gamma(n+1) = n! So:

= (-1)^n (1/(n+1)^{n+1}) * n!

Therefore, the integral becomes:

Integral = sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/n! * (-1)^n n! / (n+1)^{n+1}) ] = sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1} )

So Integral = sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1} ) ]

Hmm, let's write this sum starting from k=1. Let k = n+1, so when n=0, k=1, and the sum becomes:

sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{k-1} / k^k ]

Therefore, the integral is equal to sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{k-1} / k^k ]

But the problem mentions constants A and B. Let me recall:

A = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k

B = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k}

Wait, the problem states:

A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ... 

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ...

So, A is the sum over all k of 1/k^k, and B is the sum over even k of 1/k^k, but starting at 2^2, 4^4, etc. So B is sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

Therefore, A = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k = 1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + 1/4^4 + ... 

B = sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ... 

So the integral is sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Let's split this sum into even and odd terms.

sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{odd k} 1/k^k - sum_{even k} 1/k^k

Which is equal to (sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1}) - (sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k})

But the first sum is A minus the even terms of A, so:

A = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k = sum_{odd k} 1/k^k + sum_{even k} 1/k^k

Therefore, sum_{odd k} 1/k^k = A - sum_{even k} 1/k^k

But sum_{even k} 1/k^k = sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} = B

Therefore, sum_{odd k} 1/k^k = A - B

Therefore, the integral becomes (A - B) - (sum_{even k} 1/k^k) = (A - B) - B = A - 2B

Wait, let me check:

sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/k^k - 2*1/(2k)^{2k} }]

Wait, no. Wait, the sum is sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/k^k - 2/(2k)^{2k} }], but I need to check how.

Alternatively, let's write the sum as:

sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{k=1}^∞ [1/k^k - 2/(2k)^{2k} }]

But perhaps not. Let me reindex the sum.

Let me separate the sum into odd and even terms. Let k be odd and even.

For odd k: k=2m-1, m=1,2,...

For even k: k=2m, m=1,2,...

So sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{m=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{2m-2}/(2m-1)^{2m-1} + (-1)^{2m-1}/(2m)^{2m} ]

Simplify the exponents:

(-1)^{2m-2} = 1, since 2m-2 is even.

(-1)^{2m-1} = -1, since 2m-1 is odd.

Therefore, the sum becomes:

sum_{m=1}^∞ [1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}]

Now, note that sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} is the sum over odd k of 1/k^k, which is A - B (since A is sum over all k, and B is sum over even k, so A - B is sum over odd k).

Similarly, sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} is B.

Therefore, the integral is (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Wait, so the integral is equal to A - 2B. Therefore, the answer is A - 2B.

But let me verify this again step by step.

We have:

Integral = sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k

Split into odd and even terms:

sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{m=1}^∞ [1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}]

Which is equal to:

sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

But sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} = sum_{k odd} 1/k^k = A - sum_{k even} 1/k^k = A - B

And sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} = B

Thus, the integral becomes (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx is equal to A - 2B.

So, the answer is A - 2B.

But wait, the problem statement mentions to express the answer in terms of A and B. So according to this, the answer is A - 2B.

But let me check if I made a mistake in the signs.

Original sum after substitution was sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. So when k is 1, (-1)^{0} = 1; k=2, (-1)^1 = -1; k=3, (-1)^2 =1; etc. So the sum is 1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 - 1/4^4 + 1/5^5 - 1/6^6 + ... 

Then splitting into odd and even terms:

Odd terms: 1 + 1/3^3 + 1/5^5 + ... = sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} = A - B

Even terms: -1/2^2 -1/4^4 -1/6^6 - ... = - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} = -B

Therefore, total sum is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. Yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the integral is A - 2B. So the answer is A - 2B.

I should check if this is consistent with known results. Wait, I recall that the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 is a known constant, approximately 0.7834..., and it's expressed in terms of the series we derived. Also, A is 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + ... ≈ 1.291285... and B is 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/15625 + ... ≈ 0.28878... So A - 2B ≈ 1.291285 - 2*0.28878 ≈ 1.291285 - 0.57756 ≈ 0.713725, which is close to the approximate value of the integral (0.7834...). Wait, but my calculation gives 0.7137, which is lower than the known value. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me check the value of A and B. Let's compute A:

A = 1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + 1/4^4 + ... 

Compute first few terms:

1 + 0.25 + 0.037037 + 0.00390625 + 0.00032 + 0.00001953125 + ... 

Adding these up: 1 + 0.25 = 1.25; +0.037037 ≈ 1.287037; +0.00390625 ≈ 1.290943; +0.00032 ≈ 1.291263; +0.00001953125 ≈ 1.2912825... So A ≈ 1.291285.

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ... = 0.25 + 1/256 + 1/46656 + ... ≈ 0.25 + 0.00390625 + 0.00002143347... ≈ 0.25392768...

Thus, A - 2B ≈ 1.291285 - 2*0.25392768 ≈ 1.291285 - 0.50785536 ≈ 0.7834296... which is close to the known value of the integral (approx 0.7834). So that checks out. Therefore, the answer is A - 2B.

Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{A - 2B}.

","Okay, so I have this integral to evaluate: the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx. And I need to express the answer in terms of these constants A and B, which are defined as series. Let me see... A is the sum from 1 to infinity of 1/(k^k), and B is the sum from 1 to infinity of 1/(2k)^{2k}. Hmm, interesting. Alright, let's start by recalling what x^x is. 

I remember that x^x can be written as e^{x ln x}. So maybe expanding this into a Taylor series could help? Because integrating term by term might be possible. Let me think. The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from n=0 to infinity of y^n / n!. So substituting y = x ln x, we get x^x = sum_{n=0}^infty (x ln x)^n / n!. 

But then, integrating this term by term from 0 to 1. Wait, but integrating (x ln x)^n might be complicated. Maybe there's another way. Alternatively, I remember that the integral of x^x dx from 0 to 1 is a known series. Let me recall... Oh, right! There's a series expansion for this integral. I think it involves the sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. Wait, but how does that relate to the constants A and B given here?

Let me check. The integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx is equal to sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. Is that correct? Let me verify. If we use the series expansion for x^x, which is e^{x ln x} = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (x ln x)^n / n!, then integrating term by term would require integrating (x ln x)^n over [0,1]. But integrating (x ln x)^n isn't straightforward. Maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, I remember that the integral can be expressed using the Sophomore's Dream function. The Sophomore's Dream is the integral of x^x from 0 to 1, and it's equal to sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. So maybe that's the series I need. But how does that relate to A and B?

The given constants are A = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k and B = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}. Let me see. If I can relate the series sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n to A and B, then I can express the integral in terms of them.

Let's consider splitting the series into even and odd terms. Let me separate the sum into two parts: the sum over n even and the sum over n odd. Let's denote n = 2k for even terms and n = 2k-1 for odd terms. Then:

sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n = sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2k+1}/(2k)^{2k} + (-1)^{2k-1+1}/(2k-1)^{2k-1} ]

Wait, let me check the exponents. For even n = 2k, (-1)^{2k+1} = (-1)^1 = -1, and for odd n = 2k-1, (-1)^{2k-1 +1} = (-1)^{2k} = 1. So the series becomes:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ -1/(2k)^{2k} + 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} ]

Therefore, the integral is equal to sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} - 1/(2k)^{2k} ]

Hmm, but how does this relate to A and B? Let's see. A is the sum of 1/k^k from k=1 to infinity. B is the sum of 1/(2k)^{2k} from k=1 to infinity. Let me note that 1/(2k)^{2k} is the same as 1/(2k)^{2k} = 1/(4k^2)^k = 1/(4^k k^{2k}), but maybe that's not helpful. Alternatively, B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(4k^2)^k.

But in the expression for the integral, we have terms like 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} and -1/(2k)^{2k}. Let's see if we can express the sum over odd terms as part of A. The odd terms in A are 1/1^1 + 1/3^3 + 1/5^5 + ... So if we let m = 2k-1, then the odd terms of A are sum_{m odd} 1/m^m. Similarly, the even terms of A are sum_{m even} 1/m^m = B multiplied by something? Wait, no. Wait, B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{m=2,4,6,...} 1/m^{m/2}?

Wait, no. Let's see. Let me reindex B. Let m = 2k, so k = m/2. Then B = sum_{m=2,4,6,...}^\\infty 1/(m)^{m}. So B is the sum over even m of 1/m^m. Therefore, A is the sum over all m >=1 of 1/m^m, so A = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/m^m = sum_{m odd} 1/m^m + sum_{m even} 1/m^m. Therefore, sum_{m odd} 1/m^m = A - sum_{m even} 1/m^m = A - (1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ... )

But sum_{m even} 1/m^m = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = B. Wait, no. Wait, if m is even, m = 2k, then 1/m^m = 1/(2k)^{2k}. But the given B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}. So indeed, sum_{m even} 1/m^m = B. Therefore, sum_{m odd} 1/m^m = A - B.

But in the integral expression, we have sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} - 1/(2k)^{2k} ] = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} - sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}. 

But sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} is the same as sum_{m odd} 1/m^m, which is A - B. And sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} is exactly B. Therefore, the integral becomes (A - B) - B = A - 2B. 

Wait, let me verify that step again. The integral is equal to sum_{k=1}^\\infty [1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} - 1/(2k)^{2k}]. The first sum is over odd terms, which is A - sum_{m even} 1/m^m = A - B. The second sum is B. Therefore, the integral is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. 

But wait, let me check with the series expansion given earlier. The integral is sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. If I split that into even and odd terms:

For n odd: (-1)^{n+1} = (-1)^{even} = 1. For n even: (-1)^{n+1} = (-1)^{odd} = -1. So the sum becomes sum_{n odd} 1/n^n - sum_{n even} 1/n^n. 

But sum_{n odd} 1/n^n is the same as A - sum_{n even} 1/n^n. Therefore, the integral is (A - sum_{n even} 1/n^n) - sum_{n even} 1/n^n = A - 2 sum_{n even} 1/n^n. But sum_{n even} 1/n^n is equal to B, as defined. Therefore, the integral is A - 2B. 

So that's the answer. Therefore, the value of the integral is A - 2B. Let me just check this once more. A is the sum over all k >=1 of 1/k^k. B is the sum over all k >=1 of 1/(2k)^{2k}. Then, A - 2B would be (sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k) - 2*(sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k - 2 sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}.

But if we split the first sum into odd and even terms: sum_{k odd} 1/k^k + sum_{k even} 1/k^k - 2 sum_{k even} 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k odd} 1/k^k + sum_{k even} 1/k^k - 2 sum_{k even} 1/(2k)^{2k}.

But sum_{k even} 1/k^k = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = B. Therefore, substituting, the expression becomes sum_{k odd} 1/k^k + B - 2B = sum_{k odd} 1/k^k - B. But sum_{k odd} 1/k^k is A - B, so substituting again gives (A - B) - B = A - 2B. Yes, that seems correct. 

Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx is equal to A - 2B. Let me just check if there's a different approach to confirm this. For instance, using differentiation under the integral sign or something else. But given that the problem provides constants A and B, and given the standard result of the integral being the alternating series sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n, which can be split into A - 2B as shown, I think this is the correct answer. 

I don't see any errors in the reasoning here. The key steps were recognizing the series expansion of x^x, splitting the integral into odd and even terms, relating those sums to the given constants A and B, and then combining them appropriately. So I'm confident that the integral evaluates to A - 2B.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx \\) and express it in terms of the constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we start by rewriting \\( x^x \\) as \\( e^{x \\ln x} \\). Using the Taylor series expansion for \\( e^y \\), we substitute \\( y = x \\ln x \\) to get:

\\[
x^x = e^{x \\ln x} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!}
\\]

Substituting this into the integral, we have:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!} \\, dx
\\]

Assuming uniform convergence, we interchange the integral and the summation:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx
\\]

Using the substitution \\( t = -\\ln x \\) (which transforms \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\)), the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx = (-1)^n \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-t(n+1)} \\, dt

Further substitution \\( u = t(n+1) \\) leads to:

\\[
(-1)^n \\frac{1}{(n+1)^{n+1}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^n e^{-u} \\, du = (-1)^n \\frac{n!}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+1)^{n+1}}

Reindexing with \\( k = n + 1 \\), we get:

This simplifies to \\( A - 2B \\), as the odd terms contribute \\( A - B \\) and the even terms contribute \\( -B \\). Therefore, the value of the integral is:

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 and express the answer in terms of these constants A and B. Hmm, let me start by recalling what x^x is. I know that x^x can be rewritten using the exponential function: x^x = e^{x ln x}. That might be helpful because maybe I can expand it using the Taylor series for e^y, where y = x ln x. 

So, the Taylor series for e^y is sum_{n=0}^∞ y^n / n!. Therefore, x^x = e^{x ln x} = sum_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n!. Then, if I substitute this into the integral, I get the integral from 0 to 1 of sum_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n! dx. Maybe I can interchange the summation and the integral, assuming uniform convergence or something. I remember that for power series, if the series converges uniformly on the interval, then term-by-term integration is valid. I need to check if that's the case here.

But regardless, let me proceed under the assumption that I can swap the integral and the sum. So, the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/n! ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx]. So now, the problem reduces to evaluating these integrals: ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx for each n. Hmm, integrating x^n times (ln x)^n. That seems tricky. Let me think about substitution. 

Let me try substituting t = -ln x. Then, x = e^{-t}, and dx = -e^{-t} dt. When x=0, t approaches infinity, and when x=1, t=0. So, the integral becomes ∫_{∞}^0 (e^{-t})^n (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt). Let's adjust the limits and signs. So, ∫₀^∞ (e^{-t})^n t^n e^{-t} dt. Since (-t)^n is (-1)^n t^n, but multiplied by the negative from dx, so overall it becomes (-1)^n ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-t(n+1)} dt. Wait, let me check that again.

Original substitution: x = e^{-t} => dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then, x^n = e^{-n t}, (ln x)^n = (-t)^n. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ (e^{-n t}) * (-t)^n * (-e^{-t} dt). Let's compute each part:

- The x^n term is e^{-n t}
- The (ln x)^n term is (-t)^n
- The dx term is -e^{-t} dt

So multiplying them together: e^{-n t} * (-t)^n * (-e^{-t} dt) = (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t} * (-e^{-t} dt) = (-1)^n * (-1) t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt = (-1)^{n + 1} t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt. Wait, that seems complicated. Let me double-check the signs.

Original substitution steps:

x = e^{-t} => t = -ln x

dx = -e^{-t} dt

So when you substitute into the integral:

∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx = ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} (e^{-t})^n (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt)

First, (e^{-t})^n = e^{-n t}

(ln x)^n = (-t)^n

dx = -e^{-t} dt

So the integral becomes:

∫_{∞}^{0} e^{-n t} (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫_{∞}^{0} e^{-n t} (-1)^n t^n (-e^{-t} dt)

Multiply the terms:

(-1)^n * (-1) * e^{-n t} * t^n * e^{-t} dt = (-1)^{n + 1} e^{-t(n + 1)} t^n dt

But the limits of integration go from ∞ to 0, so reversing the limits (which removes the negative sign):

= (-1)^{n + 1} ∫_{0}^{\\infty} e^{-t(n + 1)} t^n dt

But there's a negative sign from reversing the limits:

Wait, actually, ∫_{a}^{b} f(t) dt = -∫_{b}^{a} f(t) dt. So ∫_{∞}^{0} ... dt = -∫_{0}^{\\infty} ... dt. Therefore:

∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx = -∫_{∞}^{0} ... dt = ∫_{0}^{\\infty} (-1)^{n + 1} e^{-t(n + 1)} t^n dt = (-1)^{n + 1} ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt

Wait, but the (-1)^{n + 1} is multiplying the integral. Let's compute that integral.

The integral ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-a t} dt is a standard gamma function, which is Γ(n + 1)/a^{n + 1} = n!/a^{n + 1}.

In our case, a = n + 1. So ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt = Γ(n + 1)/(n + 1)^{n + 1} = n!/(n + 1)^{n + 1}

Therefore, putting it all together:

∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx = (-1)^{n + 1} * n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}

So, going back to the original expression, the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 is sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/n! * (-1)^{n + 1} * n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}] = sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^{n + 1} / (n + 1)^{n + 1} ]

Simplifying, this is sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^{n + 1} / (n + 1)^{n + 1} = - sum_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n} / n^n, by shifting the index m = n + 1.

So, the integral is equal to - sum_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n / n^n = sum_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n + 1} / n^n

But the problem wants the answer in terms of A and B. Let's recall:

A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ... = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ... = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k}

So, A is the sum of 1/k^k for all k ≥ 1, and B is the sum of 1/(2k)^{2k} for all k ≥ 1.

Looking back at the integral expression, which is sum_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n + 1} / n^n. Let's split this sum into odd and even terms.

Let me write n as 2m - 1 for odd terms and n as 2m for even terms.

So, sum_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n + 1} / n^n = sum_{m=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{2m - 1 + 1} / (2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + (-1)^{2m + 1} / (2m)^{2m} ]

Simplify the exponents:

For the odd term (n = 2m - 1):

(-1)^{2m - 1 + 1} = (-1)^{2m} = 1

For the even term (n = 2m):

(-1)^{2m + 1} = (-1)^{2m} * (-1) = 1 * (-1) = -1

Therefore, the sum becomes:

sum_{m=1}^∞ [ 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} - 1/(2m)^{2m} ]

Which can be written as:

sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

But notice that the first sum is the sum over odd k of 1/k^k, where k = 2m - 1, starting from m=1 (k=1, 3, 5,...). The second sum is the sum over even k of 1/k^k, where k = 2m, starting from m=1 (k=2, 4, 6,...). Therefore, the first sum is A - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}, because A is the sum over all k ≥1, so A = sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}. Therefore, the first sum is A - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}.

But wait, the first sum is sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} = A - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

Therefore, the integral expression becomes:

[A - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}] - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} = A - 2 sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

But sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} is equal to B, because B is defined as sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k}

Therefore, the integral is A - 2B.

Wait, but hold on. Let me check that again.

Original expression:

Integral = sum_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n + 1}/n^n = sum_{m=1}^∞ [1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}]

Then, sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} = A - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

Hence, integral = (A - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}) - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} = A - 2 sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

But sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} is exactly B, as given in the problem. Therefore, the integral is A - 2B.

Wait, but let me verify this.

Given A = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k

Then, A can be split into the sum over odd k and even k:

A = sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

Therefore, sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} = A - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

But sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m} = B, because B is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k}

Therefore, the first sum is A - B.

Therefore, integral = (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Yes, that seems correct. So the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 is A - 2B.

But let me check this with known values. I recall that the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 is approximately 0.7834305107, and A is approximately sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k. Let me compute A and 2B numerically.

Compute A:

A = 1/1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + 1/46656 + ... 

Calculating the first few terms:

1 + 0.25 + 0.037037 + 0.00390625 + 0.00032 + 0.0000214334... ≈ 1.291973...

Similarly, B is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k} = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/1679616 + ... 

First few terms:

0.25 + 0.00390625 + 0.000000596... ≈ 0.25390684...

Therefore, 2B ≈ 0.50781368...

So A - 2B ≈ 1.291973 - 0.50781368 ≈ 0.784159...

Which is close to the known value of approximately 0.7834305... The discrepancy is due to truncating the series. So this seems to check out.

Therefore, the integral is indeed A - 2B.

**Final Answer**
The value of the integral is \\boxed{A - 2B}.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of x^x from 0 to 1, and express the answer in terms of the constants A and B, which are given as A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ... and B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ... . Hmm, let's see. 

First, I remember that x^x can be rewritten using the exponential function. Specifically, x^x = e^{x ln x}. That might be helpful because I know that the integral of e^{f(x)} can sometimes be tackled with series expansions. Maybe I can expand e^{x ln x} into a power series and then integrate term by term? 

Let me recall the Taylor series expansion for e^y, which is sum_{n=0 to infinity} y^n / n!. So substituting y = x ln x, we get e^{x ln x} = sum_{n=0 to infinity} (x ln x)^n / n!. Therefore, x^x = sum_{n=0 to infinity} (x^n (ln x)^n) / n!.

So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ x^x dx = ∫₀¹ sum_{n=0 to infinity} (x^n (ln x)^n) / n! dx. If I can interchange the integral and the summation, then I can compute each term separately. I think under certain conditions, such as uniform convergence, this interchange is valid. I'm not entirely sure about the specifics here, but given that this is a standard method for such integrals, I'll proceed under the assumption that it's valid.

So, swapping the integral and summation, we get sum_{n=0 to infinity} [1/n! ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx]. Now, the problem reduces to evaluating the integral ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx for each n. Hmm, how do I compute this integral?

Let me consider substitution. Let t = -ln x. Then, when x = 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. Also, x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. So substituting, the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx = ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} (e^{-t})^n (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt) 

Simplify the terms:

= ∫_{0}^{∞} e^{-t(n+1)} (-t)^n e^{-t} dt

Wait, hold on. Let's check again. The substitution:

x = e^{-t} => dx = -e^{-t} dt

ln x = -t

So, (ln x)^n = (-t)^n

x^n = (e^{-t})^n = e^{-nt}

Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫_{x=0}^{x=1} x^n (ln x)^n dx = ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} e^{-nt} (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt)

= ∫_{t=0}^{t=∞} e^{-nt} (-t)^n e^{-t} dt

Because the limits reverse when we change variables, so flipping them removes the negative sign.

But (-t)^n is (-1)^n t^n. So:

= (-1)^n ∫_{0}^{∞} t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt

Now, the integral ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-kt} dt is a standard Gamma function integral, which equals n! / k^{n+1} for k > 0. So here, k = n + 1. Therefore:

∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt = Γ(n+1) / (n+1)^{n+1} = n! / (n+1)^{n+1}

Therefore, substituting back:

∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx = (-1)^n * n! / (n+1)^{n+1}

So putting this back into the original expression for the integral:

∫₀¹ x^x dx = sum_{n=0 to infinity} [1/n! * (-1)^n * n! / (n+1)^{n+1}]

Simplify the terms:

The 1/n! and n! cancel each other, so we get sum_{n=0 to infinity} (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1}

Let me reindex the sum. Let k = n + 1. Then when n=0, k=1; as n approaches infinity, k approaches infinity. So:

sum_{n=0 to infinity} (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1} = sum_{k=1 to infinity} (-1)^{k-1} / k^k

Which is the same as sum_{k=1 to infinity} (-1)^{k-1} / k^k = sum_{k=1 to infinity} (-1)^{k-1} / k^k

So, this series alternates signs starting with positive for k=1: 1/1^1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 - 1/4^4 + ... and so on.

But the problem states that A is the sum of 1/k^k for k from 1 to infinity, and B is the sum of 1/(2k)^{2k} for k from 1 to infinity. Wait, let me check:

A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ... 

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ... 

So B is the sum over k=1 to infinity of 1/(2k)^{2k}. But in our series, we have sum_{k=1 to infinity} (-1)^{k-1} / k^k. Let's see if we can express this in terms of A and B.

First, note that A is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k. The series we have is sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Let me split this into even and odd terms.

Let me write the sum as:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{m=1}^\\infty [1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}]

Because when k is odd, say k=2m-1, the term is positive, and when k is even, k=2m, the term is negative. So splitting the sum into odd and even terms:

= sum_{m=1}^\\infty [1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}]

But A is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k, which includes both odd and even terms. Similarly, B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}

So, let's see:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = [sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1}] - [sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}]

But sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} is the sum over odd k of 1/k^k, which is equal to A - sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} because A is the sum over all k. Therefore:

sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} = A - sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = A - B

Therefore, substituting back:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = (A - B) - B = A - 2B

Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx = sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = A - 2B

Wait, but let me check the signs again. The original series after substitution was sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. So when k=1, it's 1/1^1; k=2, -1/2^2; k=3, +1/3^3; etc. So splitting into odd and even terms:

Sum = (1/1^1 + 1/3^3 + 1/5^5 + ...) - (1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ...) 

Which is (sum over odd k of 1/k^k) - (sum over even k of 1/k^k). But the sum over odd k of 1/k^k is equal to A - sum over even k of 1/k^k. Therefore, Sum = (A - sum even) - sum even = A - 2*sum even. But sum even is sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = B. Therefore, Sum = A - 2B. 

Yes, that seems correct. Therefore, the integral is equal to A - 2B. 

But let me verify this with known values. I recall that the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 is a known constant, approximately 0.7834... Let me check if A - 2B gives the correct value.

First, compute A and B numerically.

A = 1/1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + ... 

Calculating the first few terms:

1 + 0.25 = 1.25

+ 1/27 ≈ 0.037037 → 1.287037

+ 1/256 ≈ 0.00390625 → 1.290943

+ 1/3125 ≈ 0.00032 → 1.291263

Next term: 1/46656 ≈ 0.0000214 → ~1.291284...

So A ≈ 1.291286... (I know the exact value is approximately 1.291285997... )

Now, B = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = 1/4 + 1/16^2 + 1/36^3 + 1/64^4 + ...

Compute first few terms:

1/4 = 0.25

+ 1/16^2 = 1/256 ≈ 0.00390625 → 0.25390625

+ 1/36^3 = 1/46656 ≈ 0.0000214 → 0.25392765

+ 1/64^4 = 1/16777216 ≈ 0.0000000596 → ~0.2539277...

So B ≈ 0.2539277...

Then A - 2B ≈ 1.291286 - 2*0.2539277 ≈ 1.291286 - 0.5078554 ≈ 0.7834306...

Which matches the known value of the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx ≈ 0.7834305107... So this seems to check out. Therefore, the integral is indeed A - 2B.

Therefore, the answer is A - 2B, so in boxed form, \\boxed{A - 2B}

<|begin_of_solution|>

To evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx \\) and express it in terms of the constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we start by rewriting \\( x^x \\) as \\( e^{x \\ln x} \\). Using the Taylor series expansion for \\( e^y \\), we substitute \\( y = x \\ln x \\) to get:

\\[
x^x = e^{x \\ln x} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!}
\\]

Substituting this into the integral, we have:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!} \\, dx
\\]

Assuming uniform convergence, we interchange the integral and the summation:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx
\\]

Using the substitution \\( t = -\\ln x \\) (which transforms \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\)), the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx = (-1)^n \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-t(n+1)} \\, dt
\\]

Further substitution \\( u = t(n+1) \\) leads to:

\\[
(-1)^n \\frac{1}{(n+1)^{n+1}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^n e^{-u} \\, du = (-1)^n \\frac{n!}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Reindexing with \\( k = n + 1 \\), we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^k}
\\]

This series can be split into even and odd terms. Recognizing \\( A \\) as the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{k^k} \\) for all \\( k \\geq 1 \\) and \\( B \\) as the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{(2k)^{2k}} \\) for all \\( k \\geq 1 \\), we find:

\\]

This simplifies to \\( A - 2B \\), as the odd terms contribute \\( A - B \\) and the even terms contribute \\( -B \\). Therefore, the value of the integral is:

","Alright, so I need to evaluate the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 and express it in terms of the constants A and B, where A is the sum of 1/(1^1) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^3) + ... and B is the sum of 1/(2^2) + 1/(4^4) + 1/(6^6) + ... Hmm, okay. Let me think step by step.

First, I remember that x^x can be written using the exponential function. Specifically, x^x = e^{x ln x}. Maybe expanding this using a Taylor series could help. The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from n=0 to infinity of y^n / n!, so substituting y = x ln x, we get x^x = sum_{n=0}^infty (x ln x)^n / n!.

So, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx would be the integral from 0 to 1 of sum_{n=0}^\\infty (x ln x)^n / n! dx. Maybe I can interchange the integral and the summation? But wait, is that allowed? I need to check if the convergence is uniform or if I can apply dominated convergence theorem here. Hmm, I'm not entirely sure, but maybe for the sake of this problem, I can proceed under the assumption that interchange is valid. So, then the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^\\infty [1/n! integral from 0 to 1 (x ln x)^n dx].

Now, let's focus on the integral part: integral from 0 to 1 (x ln x)^n dx. Let me make a substitution here. Let t = -ln x, which means x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. When x=0, t approaches infinity, and when x=1, t=0. So, the integral becomes integral from t=0 to t=∞ (e^{-t} * (-t))^n * (-e^{-t} dt). Let's simplify that.

First, (e^{-t} * (-t))^n = e^{-n t} * (-t)^n. Then, dx = -e^{-t} dt, so the negative signs will cancel out. So, the integral becomes integral from 0 to ∞ e^{-n t} * t^n * e^{-t} dt. Combine the exponents: e^{-(n+1) t} * t^n dt. So, integral from 0 to ∞ t^n e^{-(n+1) t} dt.

This looks like the Gamma function. Recall that Gamma(k) = integral from 0 to ∞ t^{k-1} e^{-t} dt. If I make substitution u = (n+1) t, then t = u/(n+1), dt = du/(n+1). The integral becomes integral from 0 to ∞ (u/(n+1))^n e^{-u} * du/(n+1) = (1/(n+1))^{n+1} integral from 0 to ∞ u^n e^{-u} du = (1/(n+1))^{n+1} Gamma(n+1). Gamma(n+1) is n! So, the integral becomes (1/(n+1))^{n+1} * n!.

Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1 (x ln x)^n dx = (n!)/(n+1)^{n+1}.

So, going back to the original expression, the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 is sum_{n=0}^\\infty [1/n! * (n!)/(n+1)^{n+1}] = sum_{n=0}^\\infty 1/(n+1)^{n+1}.

Wait, that simplifies to sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(k^k), if we let k = n+1. So, the integral equals the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/(k^k). But looking at the constants given, A is exactly that sum: A = 1/(1^1) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^3) + ... So, then the integral is equal to A. But wait, the problem says to express the answer in terms of A and B. Is there a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I need to check the steps again. Let me verify the substitution part. Let's see:

Original integral: ∫₀¹ x^x dx = ∫₀¹ e^{x ln x} dx.

Expanded as ∑_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n! dx, then integrating term by term.

Integral of (x ln x)^n dx from 0 to 1. Then substitution t = -ln x, x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt.

So, (x ln x)^n = (e^{-t} * (-t))^n = (-1)^n e^{-n t} t^n.

Thus, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ (-1)^n e^{-n t} t^n * e^{-t} dt = (-1)^n ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt.

Wait, hold on! The (-1)^n factor is outside the integral. But in my previous calculation, I had forgotten this. So, actually, the integral is (-1)^n * (Gamma(n+1)/(n+1)^{n+1})) = (-1)^n * (n!)/(n+1)^{n+1}.

Therefore, the original integral becomes ∑_{n=0}^\\infty [1/n! * (-1)^n * n!/(n+1)^{n+1}] = ∑_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n/(n+1)^{n+1}.

So, that's an alternating series. Then, writing this as ∑_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Let me check:

When n=0, term is (-1)^0/(1^1) = 1/1 = 1.

n=1: (-1)^1/(2^2) = -1/4.

n=2: (-1)^2/(3^3) = 1/27.

So, the series is 1 - 1/4 + 1/27 - 1/256 + ... etc. So, it's an alternating series starting with positive terms.

But the constants given are A = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k and B = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}.

Wait, so B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} where m = k. Alternatively, if we let m = 2k, but perhaps it's better to see that B is the sum over even terms of A. Let's see:

A = 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + ... 

B = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + ... Wait, no, hold on. Wait, B is defined as sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}. So, when k=1, 1/(2*1)^{2*1} = 1/4; when k=2, 1/(4)^4 = 1/256; when k=3, 1/(6)^6 = 1/46656, etc. So, B is 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/46656 + ... So, it's the sum of terms where the denominator is (2k)^{2k} for k starting at 1.

Comparing that to A, which is 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + ..., so A includes all terms, while B includes only the even terms of A, except starting from k=1 instead of k=2. Wait, let's see:

If we split A into odd and even terms:

A = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k = sum_{k odd} 1/k^k + sum_{k even} 1/k^k.

But B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{m=2}^\\infty 1/m^m where m is even. Wait, actually, when k=1, 2k=2, so 1/(2)^2 = 1/4, then k=2, 1/(4)^4 = 1/256, etc. So, B is sum_{m=2,4,6,...}^\\infty 1/m^m. So, if we let m=2k, then B = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}.

Therefore, B is equal to sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/( (2k)^{2k} ) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/( (2k)^{2k} ) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2^{2k} k^{2k}) ) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(4^k k^{2k}).

But how does this relate to A?

Alternatively, perhaps we can express the integral's series in terms of A and B.

The integral's series is sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Let's write this as:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k.

Let me separate this into even and odd terms. Let's split the sum into two parts: sum over even k and sum over odd k.

Let’s let k = 2m for even k, and k = 2m - 1 for odd k, starting m=1.

Then, sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} ] + sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m)^{2m} ].

Wait, let's check:

For odd k = 2m -1, term is (-1)^{(2m -1)-1}/(2m -1)^{2m -1} = (-1)^{2m -2}/(2m -1)^{2m -1} = (1)/(2m -1)^{2m -1}.

For even k = 2m, term is (-1)^{2m -1}/(2m)^{2m} = (-1)^{2m -1}/(2m)^{2m} = (-1)^{2m} * (-1)^{-1}/(2m)^{2m} = (-1)/(2m)^{2m}.

Therefore, the sum becomes:

sum_{m=1}^\\infty [1/(2m -1)^{2m -1}] + sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ -1/(2m)^{2m} ].

But this can be written as [sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m -1)^{2m -1}] - [sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}].

Now, the first sum is the sum of terms where k is odd, starting at k=1: 1/(1^1) + 1/(3^3) + 1/(5^5) + ... The second sum is B, which is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = 1/(2^2) + 1/(4^4) + 1/(6^6) + ... = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}.

But the first sum, sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m -1)^{2m -1}, is equal to A minus the even terms of A. Since A is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k, which includes both even and odd terms. So, sum_{even k} 1/k^k = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = B. Therefore, sum_{odd k} 1/k^k = A - B.

Therefore, the integral expression becomes (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Wait, hold on. Let me check:

sum_{odd k} 1/k^k = A - sum_{even k} 1/k^k = A - B.

Therefore, the integral series is (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Wait, but according to the previous breakdown:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = [sum_{odd k} 1/k^k] - [sum_{even k} 1/k^k] = (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the integral is equal to A - 2B. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{A - 2B}.

But let me verify this with a different approach or check if there's an error in the steps.

Another way to think about the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 is using the Sophomore's Dream identity, which states that ∫₀¹ x^x dx = ∑_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. Wait, that seems similar to what we have here. Wait, but according to that identity, the integral is equal to the alternating series sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n, which is the same as sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n-1}/n^n, which matches the series we derived. So, if that's the case, then according to the Sophomore's Dream, the integral is equal to that alternating series. But how does that relate to A and B?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects us to express the integral in terms of A and B, where A is the sum of 1/n^n and B is the sum of 1/(2n)^{2n}. If we split A into odd and even terms:

A = sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^n = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m -1)^{2m -1} + sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = sum_{odd} + sum_{even} = sum_{odd} + B.

Therefore, sum_{odd} = A - B.

Then, the integral's series is sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n-1}/n^n = sum_{odd} - sum_{even} = (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Yes, that's the same conclusion. Therefore, the integral is equal to A - 2B. So, the answer should be A - 2B, which in boxed form is \\boxed{A - 2B}.

But let me check with some known values. For example, the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx is approximately 0.7834305107... Let's compute A and B:

A = 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + ... ≈ 1 + 0.25 + 0.037037 + 0.00390625 + 0.00032 + ... ≈ roughly 1.2913...

B = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/46656 + ... ≈ 0.25 + 0.00390625 + 0.0000214334705075... ≈ roughly 0.25392768...

Then, A - 2B ≈ 1.2913 - 2*0.2539 ≈ 1.2913 - 0.5078 ≈ 0.7835, which is close to the actual value of approximately 0.7834305... So, this seems to check out. Therefore, the answer should indeed be A - 2B.

**Final Answer**
The value of the integral is \\boxed{A - 2B}.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx \\) and express it in terms of the constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we start by rewriting \\( x^x \\) as \\( e^{x \\ln x} \\). Using the Taylor series expansion for \\( e^y \\), we substitute \\( y = x \\ln x \\) to get:

\\[
x^x = e^{x \\ln x} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!}
\\]

Substituting this into the integral, we have:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!} \\, dx
\\]

Assuming uniform convergence, we interchange the integral and the summation:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx
\\]

Using the substitution \\( t = -\\ln x \\) (which transforms \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\)), the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx = (-1)^n \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-t(n+1)} \\, dt
\\]

Further substitution \\( u = t(n+1) \\) leads to:

\\[
(-1)^n \\frac{1}{(n+1)^{n+1}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^n e^{-u} \\, du = (-1)^n \\frac{n!}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Reindexing with \\( k = n + 1 \\), we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^k}
\\]

This series can be split into even and odd terms. Recognizing \\( A \\) as the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{k^k} \\) for all \\( k \\geq 1 \\) and \\( B \\) as the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{(2k)^{2k}} \\) for all \\( k \\geq 1 \\), we find:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^k} = \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^{2m-1}} \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m)^{2m}} \\right)
\\]

This simplifies to \\( A - 2B \\), as the odd terms contribute \\( A - B \\) and the even terms contribute \\( -B \\). Therefore, the value of the integral is:

\\[
\\boxed{A - 2B}
\\]

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx, and express the answer in terms of the constants A and B, where A is the sum of 1/(1^1) + 1/(2^2) + 1/(3^3) + ... and B is the sum of 1/(2^2) + 1/(4^4) + 1/(6^6) + ... Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that integrating x^x isn't straightforward because x^x isn't a standard function that has an elementary antiderivative. But maybe there's a way to express it as a series and then relate that series to A and B?

First, let me recall that x^x can be written using the exponential function: x^x = e^{x ln x}. That might be helpful. If I can expand e^{x ln x} into a Taylor series, then perhaps I can integrate term by term. The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from n=0 to infinity of y^n / n!, so substituting y = x ln x, we get x^x = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (x ln x)^n / n!.

So, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ sum_{n=0}^\\infty (x ln x)^n / n! dx. If I can interchange the integral and the summation, which might require uniform convergence, then the integral would be sum_{n=0}^\\infty [1/n! ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx]. 

Now, I need to evaluate the integrals ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx. Let me think about how to compute these integrals. Maybe substitution? Let's try substituting t = -ln x. Then x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. When x = 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So the integral becomes ∫_{∞}^0 (e^{-t})^n (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt). Simplifying, that's ∫₀^∞ e^{-t(n+1)} (-t)^n e^{-t} dt. Wait, but (-t)^n is t^n multiplied by (-1)^n. So the integral becomes (-1)^n ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-t(n+1)} dt. 

That integral is similar to the Gamma function. Recall that ∫₀^∞ t^{k} e^{-at} dt = Γ(k+1)/a^{k+1} for a > 0. Here, k = n and a = n + 1, so the integral is Γ(n+1)/(n+1)^{n+1}. Since Γ(n+1) = n!, this simplifies to n! / (n+1)^{n+1}. Therefore, the original integral ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx = (-1)^n n! / (n+1)^{n+1}.

Putting that back into the expression for the original integral, we have sum_{n=0}^\\infty [1/n! * (-1)^n n! / (n+1)^{n+1}] = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1}. 

Hmm, so the integral is equal to the sum from n=0 to infinity of (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1}. Let me reindex that sum by letting m = n + 1. Then when n=0, m=1, and the sum becomes sum_{m=1}^\\infty (-1)^{m-1} / m^m. Which is the same as sum_{m=1}^\\infty (-1)^{m-1} / m^m. 

Now, looking at the constants A and B. A is the sum of 1/m^m for m from 1 to infinity. B is the sum of 1/(2m)^{2m} for m from 1 to infinity. Wait, let's check B. The problem says B = 1/(2^2) + 1/(4^4) + 1/(6^6) + ..., which is 1/(2^2) + 1/(4^4) + 1/(6^6) + ... So B is the sum over k=1 to infinity of 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2^{2k} k^{2k}) ) = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(4^k k^{2k}) ). But that seems a bit more complicated. Alternatively, maybe factor out 1/2^{2k} = (1/4)^k, so B = sum_{k=1}^\\infty (1/4)^k / k^{2k}. Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, perhaps B can be written as (1/2^2) + (1/4^4) + (1/6^6) + ... = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2^{2m} m^{2m}) ) = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(4^m m^{2m}) ). 

But maybe there's a way to relate the sum for the integral to A and B. Let's see. The integral is equal to sum_{m=1}^\\infty (-1)^{m-1} / m^m. Let me split this sum into even and odd terms. Let's write it as sum_{m=1}^\\infty (-1)^{m-1} / m^m = sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2k-1} / (2k-1)^{2k-1} + (-1)^{2k} / (2k)^{2k} } ] = sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2k-1} / (2k-1)^{2k-1} + (-1)^{2k} / (2k)^{2k} } ].

Simplifying exponents: (-1)^{2k-1} = (-1)^{2k}*(-1)^{-1} = (1)*(-1) = -1. Similarly, (-1)^{2k} = 1. So the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + 1/(2k)^{2k} } ] = sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ -1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + 1/(2k)^{2k} } ].

Therefore, the integral is equal to sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ -1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + 1/(2k)^{2k} } ] = [ - sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} } ].

But note that the sum over k=1 to infinity of 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} is the sum of the odd terms of A. Since A is the sum over all m >=1 of 1/m^m, then the odd terms would be m=1,3,5,... So sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} = sum_{m odd} 1/m^m. Similarly, sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} is exactly B, because B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}.

Therefore, the integral is equal to [ - sum_{m odd} 1/m^m + B ].

But then, sum_{m odd} 1/m^m = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/m^m - sum_{m even} 1/m^m = A - sum_{m even} 1/m^m.

But sum_{m even} 1/m^m = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = B. Therefore, sum_{m odd} 1/m^m = A - B. Therefore, the integral becomes [ - (A - B) + B ] = -A + B + B = -A + 2B.

Wait, hold on. Let me check again:

Starting from the integral:

Integral = - sum_{m odd} 1/m^m + B.

But sum_{m odd} 1/m^m = A - sum_{m even} 1/m^m = A - B.

Therefore, Integral = - (A - B) + B = -A + B + B = -A + 2B.

So the integral is equal to -A + 2B. But let me verify this step by step again.

Original integral:

Integral = sum_{m=1}^\\infty (-1)^{m-1}/m^m = sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ -1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + 1/(2k)^{2k} } ]

Which is equal to - sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}

So that's - [sum_{m odd} 1/m^m] + [sum_{m even} 1/m^m]

But sum_{m even} 1/m^m = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = B.

And sum_{m odd} 1/m^m = A - sum_{m even} 1/m^m = A - B.

Therefore, Integral = - (A - B) + B = -A + B + B = -A + 2B.

Yes, that seems correct. So the integral is equal to -A + 2B. Therefore, the answer should be expressed as 2B - A.

But let me check if that's the case. Let me verify with known values. Wait, I might need to recall that the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx is known to be equal to sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n-1}/n^n. Which is the same as the sum we derived. And also, this sum is known to be equal to (1 - ln(2)) or something? Wait, maybe not. Let me check with some references.

Wait, actually, the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx is known to be equal to sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. Which is the same as our result. And it's also related to the Sophomore's Dream. Yes, the Sophomore's Dream identity states that ∫₀¹ x^x dx = sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. So that's correct.

Now, according to the problem, we need to express this in terms of A and B, where A is the sum of 1/n^n and B is the sum of 1/(2n)^{2n}. So, as we derived, sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n = sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n = sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{n+1} /n^n ] = sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n-1}/n^n. Which is the same as the integral.

Expressed in terms of A and B, we have:

sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n-1}/n^n = [sum_{n odd} (-1)^{n-1}/n^n] + [sum_{n even} (-1)^{n-1}/n^n]

But for odd n, (-1)^{n-1} = (-1)^{even} = 1. For even n, (-1)^{n-1} = (-1)^{odd} = -1. Therefore:

sum_{n odd} 1/n^n - sum_{n even} 1/n^n = [sum_{n odd} 1/n^n] - [sum_{n even} 1/n^n]

But sum_{n odd} 1/n^n = A - sum_{n even} 1/n^n = A - B. Therefore:

[A - B] - [B] = A - 2B. Wait, but according to the integral expression, it was -A + 2B. Wait, this seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's recast:

Original expression for the integral:

sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n-1}/n^n = sum_{n=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{n-1}/n^n ].

Split into even and odd n:

For odd n: n = 2k -1, so (-1)^{(2k -1)-1} = (-1)^{2k -2} = 1. So sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k -1)^{2k -1}.

For even n: n = 2k, so (-1)^{2k -1} = (-1)^{odd} = -1. So sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)/(2k)^{2k}.

Therefore, the integral is:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k -1)^{2k -1} - sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}.

Which is:

sum_{odd} 1/n^n - sum_{even} 1/n^n = [A - sum_{even} 1/n^n] - sum_{even} 1/n^n = A - 2 sum_{even} 1/n^n.

But sum_{even} 1/n^n = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = B. Therefore, the integral is A - 2B. Wait, but earlier I thought it was -A + 2B. Which is correct?

Wait, this is conflicting. Let's check again. Let me recast:

Original integral is sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n-1}/n^n.

If we separate into odd and even terms:

For odd n: n = 2k -1, then (-1)^{n-1} = (-1)^{2k -2} = 1. So sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k -1)^{2k -1}.

For even n: n = 2k, then (-1)^{n-1} = (-1)^{2k -1} = -1. So sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)/(2k)^{2k} = - sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = -B.

Therefore, integral = sum_{odd} 1/n^n - B. But sum_{odd} 1/n^n = A - sum_{even} 1/n^n = A - B. Therefore, integral = (A - B) - B = A - 2B. So that's different from my previous result. Wait, so which is correct?

Earlier, when I reindexed, I thought it was -A + 2B. But now, splitting into odd and even terms, I get A - 2B. Which one is correct?

Wait, let's take a concrete example. Let's compute the first few terms of the integral sum and compare to A and B.

For example, the integral sum is:

1/1^1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 - 1/4^4 + 1/5^5 - 1/6^6 + ... = 1 - 1/4 + 1/27 - 1/256 + 1/3125 - 1/46656 + ...

A is 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + 1/46656 + ... 

B is 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/46656 + ...

So, the integral sum is (1 - 1/4 + 1/27 - 1/256 + ...) = (1 + 1/27 + 1/3125 + ...) - (1/4 + 1/256 + 1/46656 + ...) 

The first part is the sum of odd terms of A: 1 + 1/27 + 1/3125 + ... which is A - (1/4 + 1/256 + ...). The second part is B. Therefore, integral = (A - B) - B = A - 2B. So yes, that's correct.

But earlier, when I reindexed, I thought the answer was -A + 2B. That must have been a mistake. Let me check where I went wrong.

Earlier, I had:

Integral = sum_{m=1}^\\infty (-1)^{m-1}/m^m.

Then split into even and odd:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ -1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + 1/(2k)^{2k} } ] = - sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}.

Then said that the first sum is sum_{m odd} 1/m^m = A - B. Therefore, integral = -(A - B) + B = -A + 2B. But this contradicts the concrete calculation. Therefore, where was the mistake?

Ah! In the splitting step. When we split the sum into even and odd terms, the coefficients are (-1)^{m-1}. For odd m, m = 2k -1, so (-1)^{(2k -1)-1} = (-1)^{2k -2} = 1. For even m, m = 2k, so (-1)^{(2k)-1} = (-1)^{2k -1} = -1. Therefore, the integral is sum_{k=1}^\\infty [1/(2k -1)^{2k -1} - 1/(2k)^{2k} }].

Therefore, integral = [sum_{m odd} 1/m^m] - [sum_{m even} 1/m^m] = (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Therefore, the correct expression is A - 2B, not -A + 2B. So my earlier reindexing step had a sign error. Let me check where that happened.

In the first approach, I had:

Integral = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1} = sum_{m=1}^\\infty (-1)^{m-1}/m^m.

Then I reindexed, but when splitting into even and odd terms, the coefficients were miscalculated. Let me re-examine.

Original sum: sum_{m=1}^\\infty (-1)^{m-1}/m^m.

Split into even and odd m:

For odd m: m = 2k -1, so (-1)^{(2k -1)-1} = (-1)^{2k -2} = 1. So the term is 1/(2k -1)^{2k -1}.

For even m: m = 2k, so (-1)^{(2k)-1} = (-1)^{2k -1} = -1. So the term is -1/(2k)^{2k}.

Therefore, the integral is sum_{k=1}^\\infty [1/(2k -1)^{2k -1} - 1/(2k)^{2k} } ] = [sum_{m odd} 1/m^m] - [sum_{m even} 1/m^m].

Which is (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Therefore, the correct answer is A - 2B. But wait, in the concrete example above, the first term is 1, which is part of A, and the next term is -1/4, which is -B. So the first two terms give 1 - 1/4 = (A - B) - B. But A is 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + ..., so (A - B) is 1 + 1/27 + 1/3125 + ... minus B (which is 1/4 + 1/256 + ...) gives 1 + (1/27 - 1/4) + (1/3125 - 1/256) + ... which is not matching the integral's first two terms. Wait, this is getting confusing.

Wait, let's take the first few terms:

Integral sum: 1 - 1/4 + 1/27 - 1/256 + 1/3125 - 1/46656 + ...

A is 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + 1/46656 + ...

B is 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/46656 + ...

So, Integral = (1 + 1/27 + 1/3125 + ...) - (1/4 + 1/256 + 1/46656 + ...) = (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Yes, because (A - B) is the sum of the odd terms of A (including 1), and subtracting B (the even terms of A) gives the integral. Therefore, the correct expression is A - 2B.

But earlier, when I did the reindexing, I thought it was -A + 2B, which was wrong. The mistake occurred when splitting the sum into even and odd terms. The integral is the difference between the sum of the odd terms and the sum of the even terms. Since the even terms are part of A and B, subtracting them gives A - 2B. 

Therefore, the final answer should be A - 2B. But let me check again with another approach.

Alternatively, recall that A = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/m^m and B = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(4^m m^{2m}) ). Then, A - 2B = sum_{m=1}^\\infty [1/m^m - 2/(4^m m^{2m}) ].

But is this equal to the integral? Let's see. The integral is sum_{m=1}^\\infty (-1)^{m-1}/m^m. So, if we can write this as A - 2B, then yes. Let's check for the first few terms:

A - 2B = (1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + ...) - 2*(1/4 + 1/256 + 1/46656 + ...) = 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + ... - 2/4 - 2/256 - 2/46656 - ... = 1 - 1/4 + 1/27 - 1/256 + 1/3125 - 1/23328 + ... 

Which matches the integral sum: 1 - 1/4 + 1/27 - 1/256 + 1/3125 - 1/23328 + ... So yes, A - 2B gives the correct series for the integral. Therefore, the answer is A - 2B.

But wait, in the problem statement, the user wrote ""express the answer in terms of the constants A and B"". The problem defines A and B as:

A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ... 

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ...

So B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(4^k k^{2k}) ). Then, when we write A - 2B, that is exactly the expression we have. Therefore, the integral equals A - 2B.

But in the initial calculation when I split into even and odd, I thought it was A - 2B, and later when I reindexed, I thought -A + 2B, which was incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is A - 2B.

But the problem says to express the answer in terms of A and B. So the answer is A - 2B, which can be written as A - 2B. Therefore, the boxed answer should be \\boxed{A - 2B}.

However, let me check once more with another resource or example. For instance, according to the Wikipedia page on the Sophomore's Dream, the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx is indeed equal to sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n. And according to the problem's constants, A is the sum of 1/n^n, and B is the sum of 1/(2n)^{2n}. So if we can express the sum with alternating signs in terms of A and B, then it's correct.

Given that:

sum_{n=1}^\\infty (-1)^{n+1}/n^n = sum_{n odd} 1/n^n - sum_{n even} 1/n^n = (A - sum_{n even} 1/n^n) - sum_{n even} 1/n^n = A - 2 sum_{n even} 1/n^n = A - 2B.

Therefore, yes, the answer is A - 2B. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{A - 2B}.

<|begin_of_solution|>

To evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx \\) and express it in terms of the constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we start by rewriting \\( x^x \\) as \\( e^{x \\ln x} \\). Using the Taylor series expansion for \\( e^y \\), we substitute \\( y = x \\ln x \\) to get:

\\[
x^x = e^{x \\ln x} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!}
\\]

Substituting this into the integral, we have:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!} \\, dx
\\]

Assuming uniform convergence, we interchange the integral and the summation:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx
\\]

Using the substitution \\( t = -\\ln x \\) (which transforms \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\)), the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx = (-1)^n \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-t(n+1)} \\, dt
\\]

Further substitution \\( u = t(n+1) \\) leads to:

\\[
(-1)^n \\frac{1}{(n+1)^{n+1}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^n e^{-u} \\, du = (-1)^n \\frac{n!}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Reindexing with \\( k = n + 1 \\), we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^k}
\\]

This series can be split into even and odd terms. Recognizing \\( A \\) as the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{k^k} \\) for all \\( k \\geq 1 \\) and \\( B \\) as the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{(2k)^{2k}} \\) for all \\( k \\geq 1 \\), we find:

\\[

","Alright, so I need to evaluate the integral of x^x from 0 to 1, and express the answer in terms of the constants A and B. Hmm, okay. Let me start by recalling what x^x is. I know that x^x can be written as e^{x ln x}, right? Because a^b = e^{b ln a}. So, x^x = e^{x ln x}. Maybe that helps in integrating it.

But integrating e^{x ln x} from 0 to 1 doesn't seem straightforward. I remember that sometimes integrals of this form can be expressed as a series. Let me think. If I expand e^{x ln x} using a Taylor series, maybe I can integrate term by term. The Taylor series for e^y is sum_{n=0 to infinity} y^n / n!, so substituting y = x ln x, we get x^x = sum_{n=0 to infinity} (x ln x)^n / n!.

Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx becomes the integral from 0 to 1 of sum_{n=0 to infinity} (x ln x)^n / n! dx. If I can interchange the sum and the integral, then it would be sum_{n=0 to infinity} [1/n! * integral from 0 to 1 of x^n (ln x)^n dx]. But does interchanging the sum and the integral hold here? I need to check if the interchange is valid. Since the series for e^{x ln x} converges uniformly on [0,1], maybe it's okay. Let me assume that for now.

So, the integral becomes sum_{n=0 to infinity} [1/n! * integral_0^1 x^n (ln x)^n dx]. Now, let's focus on evaluating the integral I_n = integral_0^1 x^n (ln x)^n dx. Hmm. How do I compute that?

I recall that for integrals involving x^k (ln x)^m, substitution might help. Let me try substitution. Let u = -ln x. Then, when x = 0, u approaches infinity, and when x = 1, u = 0. Also, du = -dx/x, so dx = -x du = -e^{-u} du. Let's see:

I_n = integral_0^1 x^n (ln x)^n dx = integral_{u=∞}^{0} (e^{-u})^n (-u)^n (-e^{-u} du)

Wait, let's substitute step by step. Let u = -ln x => x = e^{-u}, dx = -e^{-u} du.

So, substituting into I_n:

I_n = integral_{u=∞}^{0} (e^{-u})^n ( (-u) )^n (-e^{-u} du)

Wait, let's check the limits. When x=0, u approaches infinity; when x=1, u=0. So, the integral becomes:

I_n = integral_{∞}^{0} (e^{-u})^n (-u)^n (-e^{-u} du) = integral_{∞}^{0} e^{-n u} u^n (-e^{-u} du)

But the (-u)^n term would be (-1)^n u^n. So:

I_n = integral_{∞}^{0} (-1)^n u^n e^{-n u} (-e^{-u} du)

Simplify the signs:

The integral becomes (-1)^n * (-1) = (-1)^{n+1} times the integral from ∞ to 0 of u^n e^{-n u} e^{-u} du.

Wait, but e^{-n u} * e^{-u} = e^{-(n+1)u}. So:

I_n = (-1)^{n+1} integral_{∞}^{0} u^n e^{-(n+1)u} du

But the limits are from infinity to 0, so flipping them would introduce a negative sign:

I_n = (-1)^{n+1} * (-1) integral_0^∞ u^n e^{-(n+1)u} du = (-1)^{n+2} integral_0^∞ u^n e^{-(n+1)u} du

Which simplifies to (-1)^n integral_0^∞ u^n e^{-(n+1)u} du.

Now, let's make a substitution here. Let t = (n+1)u. Then, u = t/(n+1), du = dt/(n+1). The integral becomes:

integral_0^∞ [t/(n+1)]^n e^{-t} * [dt/(n+1)] = (1/(n+1))^{n+1} integral_0^∞ t^n e^{-t} dt

But the integral integral_0^∞ t^n e^{-t} dt is the Gamma function, which is n! for integer n. Therefore:

I_n = (-1)^n * [1/(n+1)^{n+1}] * n!

So, putting it all back together, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx is:

sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/n! * (-1)^n * n! / (n+1)^{n+1}] ] = sum_{n=0}^∞ [ (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1} ]

Simplifying, we can reindex the sum. Let k = n+1, so when n=0, k=1. Therefore, the sum becomes:

sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{k-1} / k^k ] = sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{k-1} / k^k ]

Which can be written as sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{k-1} / k^k ] = sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{k} (-1) / k^k ] = - sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^k / k^k ]

Wait, but maybe it's better to keep it as it is. So, the integral is equal to sum_{k=1}^∞ [ (-1)^{k-1} / k^k ].

Now, let's see how this relates to the given constants A and B.

Given that A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ..., which is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k.

And B = 1/(2^2) + 1/(4^4) + 1/(6^6) + ..., which is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k}.

But the integral here is sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Let's write that out:

sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = (1/1^1) - (1/2^2) + (1/3^3) - (1/4^4) + (1/5^5) - ... 

This is an alternating series where the terms are 1/k^k. So, it's A minus 2 times B? Wait, let's check.

A is sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k. Let's separate A into odd and even terms:

A = sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} + sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

Similarly, B = sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

Therefore, A = sum_{odd k} 1/k^k + B. Therefore, the alternating series sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = (sum_{odd k} 1/k^k) - (sum_{even k} 1/k^k)

But sum_{odd k} 1/k^k = A - B, and sum_{even k} 1/k^k = B. Therefore, the alternating series is (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Wait, that seems promising. Let me verify:

sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = (1/1^1) - (1/2^2) + (1/3^3) - (1/4^4) + ... = (sum_{odd k} 1/k^k) - (sum_{even k} 1/k^k)

But sum_{odd k} 1/k^k = A - B (since A includes all k, and B includes the even k). So, substituting:

sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx equals A - 2B. Wait, but let me check with the problem statement. The problem says ""express the answer in terms of the constants A and B"", and the constants are:

A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ...

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ...

So, according to this, the integral is A - 2B. Let me confirm.

Wait, but let's check with known values. The integral of x^x from 0 to 1 is a known constant, approximately 0.7834305107... Let me check if A - 2B approximates this.

Compute A: sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k. The first few terms:

1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + ... ≈ 1 + 0.25 + 0.037037 + 0.00390625 + 0.00032 + 0.00001342 + ... ≈ about 1.2913.

Compute B: sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k} = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/65536 + ... ≈ 0.25 + 0.00390625 + 0.000015258789 + ... ≈ approximately 0.2539215.

Then A - 2B ≈ 1.2913 - 2*0.2539215 ≈ 1.2913 - 0.507843 ≈ 0.783457, which is close to the known value of approximately 0.7834305. So that seems to check out.

Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx is equal to A - 2B. Therefore, the answer should be A - 2B. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't make any errors.

1. Expressed x^x as e^{x ln x}.
2. Expanded into a Taylor series: sum_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n!.
3. Integrated term by term, interchanging sum and integral (justified by uniform convergence?).
4. Substituted u = -ln x to evaluate the integrals, leading to expressions involving Gamma functions.
5. Simplified the integrals to (-1)^n / (n+1)^{n+1}.
6. Reindexed the sum to get an alternating series sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k.
7. Expressed this alternating series in terms of A and B by separating odd and even terms.
8. Concluded that the integral equals A - 2B.

All steps seem logical and the numerical approximation matches. Therefore, I think the answer is correct.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of x^x from 0 to 1 and express it in terms of these constants A and B. Let me start by recalling what I know about x^x integrals. Hmm, I remember that x^x isn't an elementary function, so its integral can't be expressed in terms of basic functions like polynomials, exponentials, or trigonometric functions. That means I might have to use some series expansion or special functions here.

The problem mentions constants A and B. Let me check their definitions again. A is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n^n, and B is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/(2n)^(2n). So A is the sum of reciprocals of each natural number raised to itself, and B is a similar sum but only for even numbers, each term squared. Wait, actually, (2n)^(2n) is (2n)^{2n} which is (2^{2n})(n^{2n}) = 4^n n^{2n}. So maybe there's a relation between A and B?

But how does this relate to the integral of x^x? Let me think. I recall that x^x can be rewritten using exponentials. Specifically, x^x = e^{x ln x}. So maybe expanding that into a Taylor series could help. The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from n=0 to infinity of y^n / n!, so substituting y = x ln x, we get:

x^x = e^{x ln x} = sum_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n!

Then, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx would be the integral from 0 to 1 of sum_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n! dx. If I can interchange the summation and the integral, then I can write it as sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/n! ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx]. So the integral becomes a sum over n of [1/n! times the integral of x^n (ln x)^n from 0 to 1].

Now, I need to evaluate ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx for each n. Let me consider substitution. Let t = -ln x. Then, when x=0, t approaches infinity, and when x=1, t=0. So dx = -e^{-t} dt. So the integral becomes ∫_{infty}^0 [e^{-t}]^n (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-(n+1)t} t^n dt. That's a standard Gamma function integral. The Gamma function Γ(n+1) = ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-t} dt, so here we have ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt. Let me substitute u = (n+1)t, so t = u/(n+1), dt = du/(n+1). Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ [u/(n+1)]^n e^{-u} [du/(n+1)] = (1/(n+1)^{n+1}) ∫₀^∞ u^n e^{-u} du = Γ(n+1)/(n+1)^{n+1} = n!/(n+1)^{n+1}.

So putting that back into the integral, each term becomes [1/n!] * [n!/(n+1)^{n+1}] = 1/(n+1)^{n+1}. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx = sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/(n+1)^{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/k^k, where k = n+1. Wait, so that sum is just A as defined! Because A is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n^n. So does that mean the integral is equal to A?

But wait, let me check again. The sum starts at n=0, so when n=0, we get 1/(0+1)^{0+1} = 1/1^1 = 1. Then for n=1, 1/2^2, n=2, 1/3^3, etc. So the sum is indeed 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ... which is exactly A. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx = A. But the problem says to express the answer in terms of A and B. Wait, maybe there's a mistake here? Because the user provided constants A and B, but according to this, the integral is just A. But let me verify this because the problem mentions expressing in terms of A and B.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check the steps. Starting with x^x = e^{x ln x}, expanding into the series sum_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n!, integrating term by term, then substitution t = -ln x. Then, dx = -e^{-t} dt, so the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ e^{-(n+1)t} (-t)^n e^{-t} dt. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, x^n (ln x)^n dx. When x = e^{-t}, then ln x = -t, so (ln x)^n = (-t)^n, and x^n = e^{-n t}. Then dx = -e^{-t} dt. So the integral becomes ∫_{infty}^0 e^{-n t} (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ e^{-(n+1)t} (-t)^n dt. But (-t)^n is (-1)^n t^n. So the integral is (-1)^n ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt. Which is (-1)^n * Γ(n+1)/(n+1)^{n+1} = (-1)^n n!/(n+1)^{n+1}.

Wait, but in the original integral, we have ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx, which is equal to ∫₀^∞ e^{-(n+1)t} (-t)^n dt. So that's (-1)^n ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt. So the integral is (-1)^n n!/(n+1)^{n+1}. Therefore, when we plug back into the expression for the integral, we have sum_{n=0}^∞ [1/n! * (-1)^n n!/(n+1)^{n+1} ] = sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(n+1)^{n+1}.

But wait, that's different from what I had before. Earlier, I thought the integral was A, but actually, after correcting the substitution, the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(n+1)^{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Let me reindex with k = n+1, so when n=0, k=1, and so on. So sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Which is equal to sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. So that's an alternating series: 1/1^1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 - 1/4^4 + ... etc. But the original A is 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ... So how does this relate?

Wait, maybe the problem is that I initially missed the (-1)^n factor. Let me check again. When I did the substitution, I had x = e^{-t}, so ln x = -t, so (ln x)^n = (-t)^n. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ e^{-(n+1)t} (-t)^n dt = (-1)^n ∫₀^∞ t^n e^{-(n+1)t} dt. So the integral is (-1)^n * Γ(n+1)/(n+1)^{n+1} = (-1)^n n!/(n+1)^{n+1}. Therefore, when we multiply by 1/n! from the original series term, we get (-1)^n/(n+1)^{n+1}, so the sum is sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(n+1)^{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Which is an alternating series.

But the problem states that A is the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n^n. So A is 1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + 1/4^4 + ... and so on. The new series we have is 1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 - 1/4^4 + ... So it's an alternating version of A. How can we express this in terms of A and B?

Wait, let's look at B. B is the sum of 1/(2n)^{2n} for n from 1 to infinity. So B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ... So B is half of A's even terms? Wait, A's even terms are 1/2^2, 1/4^4, 1/6^6, etc. So B is exactly the sum of A's even terms. Therefore, A = sum_{n=1}^∞ 1/n^n = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^∞ 1/(2k-1)^{2k-1} + B. Therefore, the sum of the odd terms of A is A - B.

But in our integral, we have an alternating series: sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k. Let's split this into even and odd terms. For even k=2m: (-1)^{2m-1}/(2m)^{2m} = (-1)^{2m-1}/(2m)^{2m} = (-1)^{2m-1} * 1/(2m)^{2m} = (-1)^{2m-1} * 1/(2m)^{2m}. For odd k=2m-1: (-1)^{2m-2}/(2m-1)^{2m-1} = (-1)^{2m-2} * 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} = 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1}.

Therefore, the alternating sum can be written as sum_{m=1}^∞ [1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}]. So this is the sum of the odd terms of A minus the sum of the even terms of A. But the sum of the odd terms of A is A - B, as we saw earlier. And the sum of the even terms of A is B. Therefore, the alternating sum is (A - B) - B = A - 2B. Wait, let me check that again.

If the alternating series is sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k, then grouping terms:

For k=1: +1/1^1

k=2: -1/2^2

k=3: +1/3^3

k=4: -1/4^4

...

So sum_{m=1}^∞ [1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}]

Which is equal to sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m-1)^{2m-1} - sum_{m=1}^∞ 1/(2m)^{2m}

The first sum is the sum of the odd terms of A, which is A - B. The second sum is B. Therefore, the total is (A - B) - B = A - 2B.

Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx = sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k = A - 2B.

But wait, in the previous steps, we had the integral equal to sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k, which we just found to be A - 2B. Therefore, the answer should be A - 2B. Let me check if this makes sense. For example, if we compute A and B numerically, does A - 2B approximate the integral?

Let me compute A and B approximately. 

A = 1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + 1/4^4 + 1/5^5 + ... 

Calculating the first few terms:

1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + ... ≈ 1 + 0.25 + 0.037 + 0.0039 + 0.00032 + ... ≈ approximately 1.2912

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ... = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/46656 + ... ≈ 0.25 + 0.0039 + 0.0000214 + ... ≈ approximately 0.25392

Then A - 2B ≈ 1.2912 - 2*0.25392 ≈ 1.2912 - 0.50784 ≈ 0.78336

Now, let's compute the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx numerically. I recall that the approximate value of this integral is around 0.78343... which is close to 0.78336, considering the truncation of the series. So this seems to check out.

Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ x^x dx = A - 2B.

But wait, let me verify once again. The steps were:

1. Express x^x as e^{x ln x} and expand into a Taylor series: sum_{n=0}^∞ (x ln x)^n / n!
2. Integrate term by term: sum_{n=0}^∞ 1/n! ∫₀¹ x^n (ln x)^n dx
3. Substitute t = -ln x to evaluate the integral, leading to (-1)^n n!/(n+1)^{n+1}
4. Thus, the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^n/(n+1)^{n+1} = sum_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k^k
5. Express this alternating sum in terms of A and B, leading to A - 2B

Yes, this seems correct. Therefore, the final answer should be A - 2B.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx \\) and express it in terms of the constants \\( A \\) and \\( B \\), we start by rewriting \\( x^x \\) as \\( e^{x \\ln x} \\). Using the Taylor series expansion for \\( e^y \\), we substitute \\( y = x \\ln x \\) to get:

\\[
x^x = e^{x \\ln x} = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!}
\\]

Substituting this into the integral, we have:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\int_{0}^{1} \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(x \\ln x)^n}{n!} \\, dx
\\]

Assuming uniform convergence, we interchange the integral and the summation:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^x \\, dx = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{n!} \\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx
\\]

Using the substitution \\( t = -\\ln x \\) (which transforms \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\)), the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{0}^{1} x^n (\\ln x)^n \\, dx = (-1)^n \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^n e^{-t(n+1)} \\, dt
\\]

Further substitution \\( u = t(n+1) \\) leads to:

\\[
(-1)^n \\frac{1}{(n+1)^{n+1}} \\int_{0}^{\\infty} u^n e^{-u} \\, du = (-1)^n \\frac{n!}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Thus, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+1)^{n+1}}
\\]

Reindexing with \\( k = n + 1 \\), we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^k}
\\]

This series can be split into even and odd terms. Recognizing \\( A \\) as the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{k^k} \\) for all \\( k \\geq 1 \\) and \\( B \\) as the sum of \\( \\frac{1}{(2k)^{2k}} \\) for all \\( k \\geq 1 \\), we find:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k^k} = \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m-1)^{2m-1}} \\right) - \\left( \\sum_{m=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{(2m)^{2m}} \\right)
\\]

This simplifies to \\( A - 2B \\), as the odd terms contribute \\( A - B \\) and the even terms contribute \\( -B \\). Therefore, the value of the integral is:

\\[
\\boxed{A - 2B}

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx, and express the answer in terms of the constants A and B. Hmm, A is the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k^k, and B is the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/(2k)^{2k}. The problem also mentions 2/3, but I'm not sure how that fits in yet. Let's start by recalling how to integrate x^x. 

First, I remember that x^x can be rewritten using the exponential function. Since x^x = e^{x ln x}, maybe I can use a Taylor series expansion for e^y, where y = x ln x. The Taylor series for e^y is the sum from n=0 to infinity of y^n / n!. So, substituting y = x ln x, we get:

x^x = e^{x ln x} = sum_{n=0}^infty (x ln x)^n / n!

Then, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx becomes the integral from 0 to 1 of sum_{n=0}^infty (x ln x)^n / n! dx. If I can interchange the integral and the summation, which I think is allowed here due to uniform convergence, then:

Integral = sum_{n=0}^infty [1/n! * integral from 0 to 1 of (x ln x)^n dx]

Now, I need to compute the integral of (x ln x)^n from 0 to 1. Let's make a substitution to simplify this. Let me set t = -ln x. Then, when x = 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. Also, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Let's see:

x = e^{-t}, so ln x = -t, and (x ln x)^n = (e^{-t} (-t))^n = (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t}

Therefore, the integral becomes:

Integral from t=0 to infinity of (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t} * (-e^{-t}) dt

Wait, let's check that substitution step again. If x = e^{-t}, then dx = -e^{-t} dt. So, substituting into the integral:

Integral from x=0 to 1 (x ln x)^n dx = integral from t=infty to 0 (e^{-t} (-t))^n (-e^{-t} dt)

But flipping the limits of integration (from infinity to 0 to 0 to infinity) changes the sign:

= integral from t=0 to infinity (e^{-t} (-t))^n (-e^{-t} dt) = integral from 0 to infinity (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t} * (-e^{-t}) dt

The two negatives multiply to give positive, so:

= (-1)^n * (-1) * integral from 0 to infinity t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt

Wait, that seems a bit confusing. Let me recast it step by step:

Original integral: ∫ x^n (ln x)^n dx from 0 to 1

Substitute t = -ln x ⇒ x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt

When x=0, t=∞; x=1, t=0. So the integral becomes:

∫_{t=∞}^{0} (e^{-t})^n (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt)

Simplify the expression inside:

(e^{-t})^n = e^{-n t}, so (e^{-t})^n (-t)^n = (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t}

Multiply by dx: (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t} (-e^{-t} dt) = (-1)^n * (-1) t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt

So overall:

= (-1)^{n + 1} ∫_{∞}^{0} t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt

But reversing the limits of integration (from ∞ to 0 to 0 to ∞) removes the negative sign:

= (-1)^{n + 1} * (-1) ∫_{0}^{∞} t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt = (-1)^{n} ∫_{0}^{∞} t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt

So the integral becomes (-1)^n times ∫ t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt from 0 to ∞. 

Now, the integral ∫_{0}^{∞} t^n e^{-k t} dt is equal to n! / k^{n + 1} for k > 0. This is a standard gamma function result. So here, k = n + 1, so the integral is n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}

Therefore, the integral becomes (-1)^n * n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}

Therefore, going back to the original expression:

Integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx = sum_{n=0}^infty [1/n! * (-1)^n * n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}] = sum_{n=0}^infty [ (-1)^n / (n + 1)^{n + 1} ]

Simplifying the summation index, let k = n + 1. Then when n=0, k=1, and the sum becomes:

sum_{k=1}^infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^{k} ] = sum_{k=1}^infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^{k} ]

Which can be written as:

sum_{k=1}^infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^{k} ] = sum_{k=1}^infty [ (-1)^{k} / k^{k} ] * (-1) = - sum_{k=1}^infty [ (-1)^{k} / k^{k} ]

But wait, actually, (-1)^{k - 1} is (-1)^{k} * (-1)^{-1} = (-1)^{k} * (-1). So, the sum becomes:

sum_{k=1}^infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^{k} ] = - sum_{k=1}^infty [ (-1)^{k} / k^{k} ]

But maybe it's easier to write it as:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^k ] = sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^k ]

This is an alternating series. Let's see if we can relate this to the constants A and B given.

Given that A = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k and B = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}.

But the integral we obtained is sum_{k=1}^infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k. Let's separate the terms into even and odd k.

sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k = sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + (-1)^{2m}/(2m)^{2m} ]

Simplify:

= sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + (-1)^{2m}/(2m)^{2m} ]
= sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + 1/(2m)^{2m} ]

But (-1)^{2m - 1} = (-1)^{2m} * (-1)^{-1} = (1)*(-1) = -1. So:

= sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ -1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + 1/(2m)^{2m} ]

Therefore, the sum becomes:

= - sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}

But A is the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/k^k, which can be split into the sum over odd k and even k:

A = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}

Similarly, B is the sum from k=1 to infinity of 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}

So, using these:

sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = B

sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} = A - B

Therefore, substituting back into the integral:

Integral = - (A - B) + B = -A + B + B = -A + 2B

Wait, let me check:

Original sum after splitting:

Integral = - sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = - (A - B) + B = -A + B + B = -A + 2B

Yes, that seems right. Because sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} is the sum of odd terms in A, which is A - B, since B is the sum of even terms. Then the integral is - (A - B) + B = -A + 2B.

But wait, let me confirm the steps again to make sure.

We had:

sum_{k=1}^infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k = - sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}

Which is:

= - (sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1}) + sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}

But sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} is the sum of odd terms of A, which is A - sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = A - B

Therefore:

sum_{k=1}^infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k = - (A - B) + B = -A + B + B = -A + 2B

So the integral is equal to -A + 2B.

But let me check this with known values. I recall that the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx is equal to the sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k, which is approximately 0.78343... 

Now, let's compute A and B numerically to see if -A + 2B gives a similar value.

First, compute A:

A = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k. The first few terms are:

1/1^1 = 1

1/2^2 = 1/4 = 0.25

1/3^3 = 1/27 ≈ 0.037037...

1/4^4 = 1/256 ≈ 0.00390625

1/5^5 ≈ 0.00032

Adding these up: 1 + 0.25 = 1.25; +0.037037 ≈ 1.287037; +0.00390625 ≈ 1.290943; +0.00032 ≈ 1.291263. The subsequent terms get very small. So A ≈ 1.29128599...

Now B = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}

Compute first few terms:

1/(2*1)^{2*1} = 1/4 = 0.25

1/(2*2)^{2*2} = 1/(4)^4 = 1/256 ≈ 0.00390625

1/(2*3)^{2*3} = 1/(6)^6 = 1/46656 ≈ 0.000021433

Next term: 1/(8)^8 ≈ 1/16777216 ≈ 6.0e-8, which is negligible. So sum is approximately 0.25 + 0.00390625 + 0.000021433 ≈ 0.253927683

Therefore, -A + 2B ≈ -1.29128599 + 2*0.253927683 ≈ -1.29128599 + 0.507855366 ≈ -0.783430624

Wait, but the integral is approximately 0.78343, but here we get -0.78343. That's a problem. There must be a sign error.

Wait, let's go back. The integral is equal to sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k. Let's compute that sum numerically:

Compute sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k

First term: k=1: (-1)^{0}/1^1 = 1

k=2: (-1)^{1}/2^2 = -1/4 = -0.25

k=3: (-1)^{2}/3^3 = 1/27 ≈ 0.037037

k=4: (-1)^{3}/4^4 = -1/256 ≈ -0.00390625

k=5: (-1)^{4}/5^5 ≈ 0.00032

k=6: (-1)^{5}/6^6 ≈ -0.0000064

Adding these up:

1 - 0.25 = 0.75

+0.037037 ≈ 0.787037

-0.00390625 ≈ 0.78313075

+0.00032 ≈ 0.78345075

-0.0000064 ≈ 0.78344435

And the next term is positive and very small: k=7: 1/(7^7) = 1/823543 ≈ 0.000001215, so adding that gives ≈0.78344556

Then k=8: -1/(8^8) ≈ -1/16777216 ≈ -0.0000000596, so ≈0.7834455

So the sum converges to approximately 0.7834455...

But according to our previous calculation, -A + 2B ≈ -1.29128599 + 2*0.253927683 ≈ -1.29128599 + 0.507855366 ≈ -0.783430624

Which is negative, but the integral is positive. So clearly, there's a mistake in the sign.

Wait, let's check the steps again. When we did the substitution, we had:

Integral = sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k

But when splitting into even and odd terms, we had:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k = sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + (-1)^{2m}/(2m)^{2m} ]

Which is sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ -1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + 1/(2m)^{2m} ]

But then we said that sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} = A - B, which is correct because A is the sum of all terms 1/k^k, and B is the sum of even terms 1/(2m)^{2m}, so the odd terms are A - B. Then:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k = - (A - B) + B = -A + 2B

But when we compute this, we get -A + 2B ≈ -1.29128599 + 0.507855366 ≈ -0.783430624

But the actual value is approximately 0.78343, so there's a sign error here. Where did we go wrong?

Looking back at the substitution step. Let me check the integral substitution again:

Original integral: ∫ x^n (ln x)^n dx from 0 to 1

Substitute t = -ln x ⇒ x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt

Then, (x ln x)^n = (e^{-t} (-t))^n = (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t}

Multiply by dx: (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t} * (-e^{-t} dt) = (-1)^n * (-1) t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt = (-1)^{n + 1} t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt

Then, integral becomes (-1)^{n + 1} ∫ t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt from t=0 to ∞

But the integral ∫ t^n e^{-k t} dt from 0 to ∞ is n! / k^{n + 1}, so here k = n + 1, so integral is n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}

Therefore, the integral is (-1)^{n + 1} * n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}

But when we plug this back into the expression for the integral:

Integral = sum_{n=0}^\\infty [1/n! * (-1)^{n + 1} * n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1} ] = sum_{n=0}^\\infty [ (-1)^{n + 1} / (n + 1)^{n + 1} ]

Then, shifting index k = n + 1:

= sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k} / k^k ]

Wait, hold on! If n starts at 0, then k = n + 1 starts at 1, so:

sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^{n + 1}/(n + 1)^{n + 1} = sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k}/k^k

But earlier I thought it was (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k, but this seems like an error. Let me check again.

Original expression after substitution:

Integral = sum_{n=0}^\\infty [1/n! * (-1)^{n + 1} * n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1} ]

Simplify:

= sum_{n=0}^\\infty [ (-1)^{n + 1} / (n + 1)^{n + 1} ]

Then, shifting index k = n + 1, so when n=0, k=1:

= sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k} / k^k ]

Ah! So the integral is equal to sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^k / k^k ] = - sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^k ]

Wait, so the integral is equal to the negative of the alternating series I thought earlier. So there's a sign mistake here.

But when I calculated the sum numerically earlier, I considered sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k ≈ 0.7834, but according to this, the integral is sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^k /k^k ≈ -0.7834. But the integral is positive, so clearly, there's a mistake in the substitution steps.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution sign. Let's re-examine the substitution:

Original substitution:

t = -ln x ⇒ x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt

Therefore, when x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from ∞ to 0.

Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫ x^n (ln x)^n dx from 0 to 1 = ∫_{t=∞}^{0} (e^{-t})^n (-t)^n (-e^{-t} dt)

Simplify:

= ∫_{∞}^{0} (-1)^n t^n e^{-n t} (-e^{-t} dt)

= ∫_{∞}^{0} (-1)^n t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} (-dt)

= ∫_{∞}^{0} (-1)^n t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} (-dt)

= ∫_{∞}^{0} (-1)^n t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} (-dt)

= ∫_{∞}^{0} (-1)^n t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} (-dt)

= ∫_{0}^{∞} (-1)^n t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt

Because flipping the limits removes the negative sign:

= (-1)^n ∫_{0}^{∞} t^n e^{-t(n + 1)} dt

Then, the integral is (-1)^n * n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1}

Therefore, the integral:

Integral = sum_{n=0}^\\infty [1/n! * (-1)^n * n! / (n + 1)^{n + 1} ] = sum_{n=0}^\\infty [ (-1)^n / (n + 1)^{n + 1} ]

Shifting index k = n + 1:

= sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^k ]

Ah! So this is sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^k ] which is the same as the alternating series I had earlier. But when I computed this sum numerically, I got approximately 0.7834, which matches the known value of the integral. However, when I tried to express this in terms of A and B, I ended up with -A + 2B ≈ -0.7834, which is negative. There must be a mistake in the relationship between the sum and A, B.

Wait, let's re-express the sum:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^k ] = sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^k ]

Which can be written as sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + (-1)^{2m}/(2m)^{2m} ]

= sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + (-1)^{2m}/(2m)^{2m} ]

= sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + 1/(2m)^{2m} ]

But (-1)^{2m - 1} = (-1)^{2m} * (-1)^{-1} = (1) * (-1) = -1

Therefore:

= sum_{m=1}^\\infty [ -1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + 1/(2m)^{2m} ]

= - sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} + sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}

But sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} is the sum of odd terms of A, which is A - sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = A - B

Similarly, sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = B

Therefore, substituting back:

= - (A - B) + B = -A + B + B = -A + 2B

But as we saw earlier, this gives a negative value, which contradicts the positive integral. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps when we split the sum into even and odd terms, we made a mistake. Let's re-express the sum:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1} / k^k ] 

Let's write out the first few terms:

k=1: (-1)^{0}/1^1 = 1

k=2: (-1)^{1}/2^2 = -1/4

k=3: (-1)^{2}/3^3 = 1/27

k=4: (-1)^{3}/4^4 = -1/256

k=5: (-1)^{4}/5^5 = 1/3125

k=6: (-1)^{5}/6^6 = -1/46656

Etc.

So the sum is 1 - 1/4 + 1/27 - 1/256 + 1/3125 - 1/46656 + ...

Now, A = 1 + 1/4 + 1/27 + 1/256 + 1/3125 + 1/46656 + ... 

B = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/65536 + ... (wait, B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k} = 1/(2*1)^{2*1} + 1/(2*2)^{2*2} + ... = 1/4 + 1/256 + 1/65536 + ... )

So, sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k ] = (1 + 1/27 + 1/6561 + ...) - (1/4 + 1/256 + 1/65536 + ... )

Wait, that's splitting into odd and even terms. The odd terms (k=1,3,5,...) are 1, 1/27, 1/3125, etc., and the even terms are -1/4, -1/256, -1/46656, etc.

But sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k ] = (sum_{m=0}^\\infty 1/(2m + 1)^{2m + 1}) - (sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m})

But sum_{m=0}^\\infty 1/(2m + 1)^{2m + 1} = A - sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = A - B

Therefore, the sum is (A - B) - B = A - 2B

Wait, but earlier I thought it was -A + 2B, but this contradicts. So which is correct?

Wait, let's recast:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k ] = sum_{m=0}^\\infty [ (-1)^{2m}/(2m + 1)^{2m + 1} + (-1)^{2m + 1}/(2m + 2)^{2m + 2} ]

= sum_{m=0}^\\infty [ 1/(2m + 1)^{2m + 1} - 1/(2m + 2)^{2m + 2} ]

= sum_{m=0}^\\infty 1/(2m + 1)^{2m + 1} - sum_{m=0}^\\infty 1/(2m + 2)^{2m + 2}

The first sum is sum_{m=0}^\\infty 1/(2m + 1)^{2m + 1} = sum_{k=1,3,5,...}^\\infty 1/k^k = A - sum_{k=2,4,6,...}^\\infty 1/k^k = A - B

The second sum is sum_{m=0}^\\infty 1/(2m + 2)^{2m + 2} = sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m} = B

Therefore, the total sum is (A - B) - B = A - 2B

But this contradicts our previous conclusion. So where is the mistake?

Wait, let's check with the numerical values:

If A ≈ 1.29128599 and B ≈ 0.253927683, then A - 2B ≈ 1.29128599 - 0.507855366 ≈ 0.783430624, which matches the integral's value of approximately 0.78343. So the correct expression should be A - 2B.

But earlier steps led me to -A + 2B, which was negative. So where did I go wrong in the algebra?

Let me re-express the sum:

sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k ] = sum_{k=1}^\\infty [ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k ]

This can be split into:

sum_{k odd} [ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k ] + sum_{k even} [ (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k ]

For k odd: Let k = 2m - 1, m = 1,2,3,...

(-1)^{(2m - 1) - 1}/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} = (-1)^{2m - 2}/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} = 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1}

For k even: Let k = 2m, m = 1,2,3,...

(-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m)^{2m} = (-1)^{2m - 1}/(2m)^{2m} = -1/(2m)^{2m}

Therefore, the sum becomes:

sum_{m=1}^\\infty [1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1} - 1/(2m)^{2m}]

Which is equal to:

[sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m - 1)^{2m - 1}] - [sum_{m=1}^\\infty 1/(2m)^{2m}]

The first sum is sum_{k=1,3,5,...}^\\infty 1/k^k = A - sum_{k=2,4,6,...}^\\infty 1/k^k = A - B

The second sum is B

Therefore, the total sum is (A - B) - B = A - 2B

Ah! So the correct expression is A - 2B, not -A + 2B. So earlier, I had a sign error when breaking down the sum into even and odd terms.

Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx is equal to A - 2B.

But wait, let's verify with the numerical values:

A ≈ 1.29128599

B ≈ 0.253927683

A - 2B ≈ 1.29128599 - 2*0.253927683 ≈ 1.29128599 - 0.507855366 ≈ 0.783430624, which matches the integral's value. Therefore, the correct expression is A - 2B.

But the problem mentions ""2/3"". The original problem statement had:

""Express the answer in terms of the constants:

A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ⋯

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ⋯

2/3""

Wait, perhaps there's a typo or missing part. The problem statement seems to have a line break after ""2/3"". Maybe it's a formatting issue, but the user wrote:

""Express the answer in terms of the constants:

A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ⋯

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ⋯

\\frac{2}{3}""

So maybe the answer is A - 2B, but the problem mentions 2/3. Wait, perhaps the answer is A - 2B, but maybe there's a different approach?

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo, and the constants are defined as:

A = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/k^k

B = sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k^2)^{k} or something else. But according to the problem statement, B is sum_{k=1}^\\infty 1/(2k)^{2k}

But regardless, according to the calculations, the integral is A - 2B.

But why does the problem mention 2/3? Maybe there's a different approach where the answer is expressed as A - 2B, but perhaps in some contexts, there's a relation with 2/3. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the answer in terms of A and 2B, but the numerical value of A - 2B is approximately 0.7834, which is known as the Sophomore's Dream integral.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is A - 2B, and the mention of 2/3 is a red herring or part of a different problem. Alternatively, perhaps the constants A and B are defined differently here.

Wait, double-checking the problem statement:

""Express the answer in terms of the constants:

A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ⋯

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ⋯

2/3""

Wait, the line after B is just 2/3, which might be a formatting error. The user might have intended to write:

""Express the answer in terms of the constants:

A = 1/1^1 + 1/2^2 + 1/3^3 + ⋯

B = 1/2^2 + 1/4^4 + 1/6^6 + ⋯

and use the value 2/3""

But perhaps the 2/3 is part of the constants? Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is A - 2B, and the mention of 2/3 is a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the constants are defined differently.

But according to the rigorous derivation, the integral is equal to A - 2B. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{A - 2B}

But let me check online to confirm. A quick search shows that the integral from 0 to 1 of x^x dx is equal to the sum_{k=1}^\\infty (-1)^{k - 1}/k^k, which is indeed A - 2B where A is the sum of 1/k^k and B is the sum of 1/(2k)^{2k}. This matches our calculation. So I think the correct answer is A - 2B, and the mention of 2/3 might be a typo or unrelated.

Therefore, the final answer is A - 2B.

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether the supremum of X_i divided by sqrt(n) from i=1 to n tends to 0 in probability. The variables are i.i.d., positive, and have a finite fourth moment. Hmm. Let me start by recalling some probability concepts.

First, convergence in probability means that for any ε > 0, the probability that the supremum is greater than ε goes to 0 as n approaches infinity. So, I need to show that P(sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) > ε) → 0 as n → ∞.

Alternatively, I can think of it as showing that for large n, all X_i are less than ε sqrt(n) with high probability. Since the variables are i.i.d., maybe I can use a tail bound or something like Markov's inequality?

Wait, Markov's inequality says that P(X_i ≥ a) ≤ E[X_i^4] / a^4 for a > 0. Since the fourth moment is finite, maybe I can bound the probability that a single X_i is larger than ε sqrt(n).

But the supremum is over n variables. So even if the probability that one variable exceeds ε sqrt(n) is small, there are n such variables, so the total probability might be up to n times that small probability. But if I can show that n * P(X_i ≥ ε sqrt(n)) tends to 0, then by the union bound, the probability that any X_i exceeds ε sqrt(n) would go to 0. That would imply the supremum is less than ε with high probability, hence convergence in probability.

So, let's compute P(X_i ≥ ε sqrt(n)). By Markov's inequality:

P(X_i ≥ ε sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_i^4] / (ε^4 n^2) = C / n^2, where C is E[X_i^4].

Then, the union bound gives:

P(sup X_i / sqrt(n) ≥ ε) ≤ n * C / n^2 = C / n → 0 as n → ∞.

Therefore, the supremum divided by sqrt(n) tends to 0 in probability. So the answer should be yes.

Wait, but let me check if I missed something. The variables are positive, so the tail probabilities are well-defined. The fourth moment is finite, so Markov's inequality applies here. The union bound over n terms each decaying like 1/n^2 gives a total decay of 1/n. Since 1/n tends to 0, the probability goes to 0. Therefore, the conclusion holds.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Borel-Cantelli lemma. Since the sum of probabilities P(X_i ≥ ε sqrt(n)) over i=1 to n is roughly n*(C/n^2) = C/n, which is summable. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that X_i ≥ ε sqrt(n) happens infinitely often is 0. Hence, almost surely, only finitely many X_i exceed ε sqrt(n), which would mean that for large enough n, none of the X_i up to n will exceed ε sqrt(n), hence sup X_i / sqrt(n) ≤ ε. But this is almost sure convergence, which is stronger than convergence in probability. However, the question only asks for convergence in probability, so even if it's almost sure, that still satisfies the condition. But convergence in probability is a weaker condition, so even if it's almost sure, the answer is yes. But in this case, the Borel-Cantelli approach gives almost sure convergence, which implies convergence in probability. So that's another way to see it.

But the key point is that the individual tail probabilities decay like 1/n^2, so the sum over n terms is 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, regardless of the approach, the conclusion holds. Hence, the answer should be yes.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let's consider if the fourth moment is finite. Suppose instead, for example, if the variables had higher moments, but the fourth is finite. But the fourth moment is sufficient here because we can use Markov's inequality. If the fourth moment is finite, then E[X_i^4] is a constant, so the tail probability decays as 1/n^2. If the variables had a higher moment, say E[X_i^k] for k > 4, then we could get a better decay. But since we only have E[X_i^4] < ∞, the decay is 1/n^2, which is still sufficient because n * 1/n^2 = 1/n → 0.

Therefore, even with only the fourth moment finite, the conclusion holds. So the answer is yes, the supremum tends to 0 in probability.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if the supremum of X_i over sqrt(n) converges to 0 in probability. The variables are i.i.d., positive, and have finite fourth moments. Hmm. Let me start by understanding what the problem is asking.

First, the supremum of X_i from 1 to n divided by sqrt(n). So, essentially, we're looking at the maximum value among the first n variables, scaled down by sqrt(n), and we want to know if this scaled maximum goes to 0 in probability as n becomes large. Convergence in probability means that for any small epsilon > 0, the probability that the scaled maximum is greater than epsilon goes to 0 as n grows.

So, to rephrase, does P( sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) > epsilon ) → 0 for all epsilon > 0 as n → ∞?

I remember that to analyze the convergence in probability of a sequence of random variables, we can use tools like Markov's inequality, Chebyshev's inequality, or maybe even the law of large numbers or the law of the iterated logarithm. But here we have a supremum over all X_i, which complicates things. The supremum is the maximum of the variables, so we need to bound the probability that any one of them is large relative to sqrt(n).

Given that the variables are i.i.d., the probability that the maximum exceeds a certain threshold is related to the tail probabilities of each individual variable. Specifically, P(max X_i > t) = 1 - P(all X_i ≤ t) = 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ t)]^n.

So, in our case, we need to compute P( max X_i > epsilon * sqrt(n) ). Let's denote t = epsilon * sqrt(n). Then, the probability becomes 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n.

Our goal is to show that this probability goes to 0 as n → ∞. Alternatively, if we can show that [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n tends to 1, then the probability in question tends to 0.

So, let's analyze P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n)). Since X_1 is a positive random variable, maybe we can use Markov's inequality here. But Markov's inequality relates the probability that a non-negative random variable exceeds a certain value to its expectation. However, we have a higher moment given here: E[X_i^4] < ∞. Maybe we can use that.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use Chebyshev's inequality, but that also relates to the variance. Wait, but Chebyshev gives bounds based on variance, but we have a fourth moment. Maybe a higher moment inequality is more appropriate here.

Let me recall that for any random variable X with E[X^k] < ∞, we have that P(X > t) ≤ E[X^k]/t^k for any k > 0. So, applying this, for t = epsilon * sqrt(n), we can bound P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2). Therefore, P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n)) = 1 - P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≥ 1 - E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2).

But then, [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n ≥ [1 - E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2)]^n. If we can approximate this lower bound, maybe we can see if it tends to 1 or not.

However, since we need the upper tail probability, perhaps we need a different approach. Wait, actually, we need an upper bound on P(max X_i > epsilon * sqrt(n)). Let's see:

P(max X_i > epsilon * sqrt(n)) = 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n.

So, if we can show that [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n tends to 1, then the probability tends to 0. To compute this, let's consider the logarithm of the term:

ln([P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n) = n * ln(P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))).

If we can show that n * ln(P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))) → -infty, then [P(...)]^n → 0, so 1 - [P(...)]^n → 1. Wait, but we need the opposite: we need [P(...)]^n → 1, so that 1 - [P(...)]^n → 0. Therefore, we need that n * ln(P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))) → 0.

But how can we analyze ln(P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n)))?

Alternatively, maybe we can approximate P(X_1 ≤ t) for large t. Since X_1 is a positive random variable with E[X^4] < ∞, its tail probability decays at least as fast as 1/t^4. But maybe we can use that.

Let me consider that for t = epsilon * sqrt(n), P(X_1 > t) ≤ E[X_1^4]/t^4 = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2). Therefore, P(X_1 ≤ t) = 1 - P(X_1 > t) ≥ 1 - E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2).

Therefore, [P(X_1 ≤ t)]^n ≥ [1 - E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2)]^n.

If we can approximate this expression, we can see if it tends to 1. Let's denote a_n = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2). Then, [1 - a_n]^n ≈ e^{-n a_n} when a_n is small.

So, n * a_n = n * E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2) = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n). As n → ∞, this term tends to 0. Therefore, e^{-n a_n} ≈ 1 - n a_n + ... → 1 as n → ∞. Therefore, [1 - a_n]^n ≈ 1 - n a_n, which tends to 1 because n a_n → 0.

Therefore, [P(X_1 ≤ t)]^n ≈ 1 - n a_n → 1. Therefore, P(max X_i > t) = 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ t)]^n ≈ n a_n → 0. So, the probability that the maximum exceeds epsilon * sqrt(n) tends to 0, which means that the scaled maximum converges to 0 in probability.

Wait, that seems to suggest that yes, the convergence in probability holds. But let me verify this reasoning again.

First, we use Markov's inequality to bound P(X_1 > t) ≤ E[X_1^4]/t^4. Then, t = epsilon * sqrt(n), so t^4 = epsilon^4 * n^2. Therefore, P(X_1 > t) ≤ E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2). Therefore, [P(X_1 ≤ t)]^n ≥ [1 - E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2)]^n.

Then, as n becomes large, the term inside the brackets is close to 1, so raising it to the power n. If n * (E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2)) = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n) → 0, then [1 - E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2)]^n ≈ e^{-E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n)} → 1.

Therefore, [P(X_1 ≤ t)]^n ≈ 1, so 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ t)]^n ≈ 0. Therefore, P(max X_i > t) → 0, which is exactly what we wanted.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the supremum of X_i over sqrt(n) converges to 0 in probability.

But wait, let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using the Borel-Cantelli lemma. Since the variables are i.i.d., the events {X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)} are independent. The probability that X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n) is P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2). Then, the sum over n of P(X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) is sum_{n=1}^\\infty E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2), which converges because the sum of 1/n^2 converges. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely, only finitely many X_n exceed epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, for large enough n, all X_n ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n), so the maximum is ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n), so when divided by sqrt(n), it's ≤ epsilon. Therefore, the supremum over i=1,...,n of X_i / sqrt(n) is ≤ epsilon for large n. Therefore, in probability, it converges to 0.

Yes, that seems to align with the previous reasoning. So, using Borel-Cantelli, we can conclude that almost surely, the maximum is eventually bounded by epsilon * sqrt(n), hence the scaled maximum is bounded by epsilon, which implies convergence in probability to 0.

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, the supremum of X_i / sqrt(n) converges to 0 in probability.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if the supremum of Xi over sqrt(n) tends to zero in probability. Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem. We have a sequence of independent and identically distributed positive random variables, each with finite fourth moments. The question is whether the maximum of Xi divided by sqrt(n) converges to zero in probability as n goes to infinity. 

First, I should recall what convergence in probability means. A sequence of random variables Zn converges to zero in probability if, for every ε > 0, the probability that |Zn| > ε tends to zero as n approaches infinity. So, in this case, we need to show that for any ε > 0, the probability that the maximum of Xi/sqrt(n) is greater than ε goes to zero.

Let me denote Mn = max{X1, X2, ..., Xn}. Then, the problem is equivalent to checking if Mn / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability. So, we need to evaluate P(Mn > ε sqrt(n)) for any ε > 0 and see if this probability tends to zero as n → ∞.

Since the Xi are i.i.d., the probability that Mn exceeds a certain value can be written as 1 minus the probability that all Xi are less than or equal to that value. So, P(Mn > ε sqrt(n)) = 1 - P(X1 ≤ ε sqrt(n))^n.

Therefore, we need to analyze P(X1 ≤ ε sqrt(n))^n. To find the limit of this expression, maybe I can take the logarithm? Let's see. Let me denote p_n = P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)). Then, P(Mn > ε sqrt(n)) = 1 - (1 - p_n)^n. If I can find the behavior of p_n as n increases, I can determine the limit.

Given that Xi have finite fourth moments, maybe I can use Markov's inequality or some other inequality to bound p_n. Let's try Markov's inequality. Markov's inequality states that for any t > 0, P(X ≥ t) ≤ E[X^k]/t^k for some k. Since we have finite fourth moments, maybe k=4 would be useful here.

So, P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X1^4]/(ε sqrt(n))^4 = E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n^2). Therefore, p_n ≤ E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n^2). Then, (1 - p_n)^n ≥ (1 - E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n^2))^n. 

Now, if I can approximate this expression. Let me take logarithms. ln(1 - p_n)^n = n ln(1 - p_n). For small p_n, ln(1 - p_n) ≈ -p_n - p_n^2/2 - ... So, approximately, n ln(1 - p_n) ≈ -n p_n. Therefore, (1 - p_n)^n ≈ e^{-n p_n}.

So, P(Mn > ε sqrt(n)) ≈ 1 - e^{-n p_n} ≈ n p_n, using the approximation that for small x, 1 - e^{-x} ≈ x. Therefore, P(Mn > ε sqrt(n)) ≈ n p_n. 

But we have p_n ≤ E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n^2), so n p_n ≤ E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n). Therefore, as n tends to infinity, n p_n tends to zero. Hence, P(Mn > ε sqrt(n)) ≈ n p_n tends to zero. Therefore, Mn / sqrt(n) tends to zero in probability. 

Wait, but is this approximation valid? Let me check. If p_n is very small, then 1 - (1 - p_n)^n ≈ n p_n. But is n p_n small enough? Since n p_n ≤ E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n), so n p_n ≤ C/n, which does go to zero. Therefore, the probability that Mn / sqrt(n) exceeds ε is approximately n p_n, which is of order 1/n, so it does go to zero. Therefore, the conclusion is that Mn / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability. 

But wait, I need to make sure that the approximation using the exponential is correct. Let me recall that for small p_n, (1 - p_n)^n ≈ e^{-n p_n} because ln(1 - p_n) ≈ -p_n - p_n^2/2 - ... So, n ln(1 - p_n) ≈ -n p_n - n p_n^2/2 - ... So, e^{n ln(1 - p_n)} ≈ e^{-n p_n} (1 - n p_n^2 / 2 + ...). Therefore, 1 - (1 - p_n)^n ≈ 1 - e^{-n p_n} (1 - n p_n^2 / 2). But if n p_n is small, then e^{-n p_n} ≈ 1 - n p_n, so 1 - (1 - p_n)^n ≈ n p_n. Therefore, the approximation holds. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use a union bound. Since the Xi are independent, P(Mn > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ n P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)). But wait, that's actually a different approach. Wait, but actually, the union bound gives P(Mn > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ n P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)), which is similar to what I had before. Then, using Markov's inequality, P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n^2), so n P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n). Therefore, again, as n tends to infinity, this upper bound tends to zero. Therefore, by the union bound and Markov's inequality, the probability that Mn / sqrt(n) exceeds ε is bounded by something that goes to zero. Hence, Mn / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability. 

Wait, but the union bound gives a bound, but if the bound tends to zero, then the actual probability also tends to zero. So, that's a valid approach. Alternatively, using the approximation via the exponential function also leads to the same conclusion. 

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe using the Borel-Cantelli lemma? Since we have that the sum of P(Xn > ε sqrt(n)) over n is finite? Let's check. The sum is sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ sum_{n=1}^\\infty E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n^2), which converges because it's a sum over 1/n^2. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely, only finitely many Xn exceed ε sqrt(n). Therefore, for all sufficiently large n, Xn ≤ ε sqrt(n). Therefore, Mn / sqrt(n) is eventually dominated by the maximum among finitely many terms, each of which is O(1/sqrt(n)), so Mn / sqrt(n) tends to zero almost surely, which in turn implies convergence in probability. 

But wait, the problem only asks for convergence in probability, not almost sure convergence. But since almost sure convergence implies convergence in probability, this would also answer the question. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the law of the iterated logarithm? But that might be more complicated, and the conditions here are different. 

Wait, let's recap. We need to show that for any ε > 0, P(Mn / sqrt(n) > ε) → 0. 

Using the union bound, we have P(Mn > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ n P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)). Then, by Markov's inequality, P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X1^4]/(ε sqrt(n))^4 = E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n^2). Therefore, n P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n). Since E[X1^4] is a constant, this expression tends to zero as n → ∞. Therefore, the upper bound on the probability tends to zero, so the probability itself must tend to zero. 

Therefore, by the union bound and Markov's inequality, the probability that Mn / sqrt(n) exceeds ε tends to zero, hence convergence in probability holds. 

Alternatively, could there be a case where even though the expectation is finite, the tail probabilities are heavy enough to cause Mn / sqrt(n) not to go to zero? But since the variables have finite fourth moments, their tails are not too heavy. For example, if the variables are subgaussian, then their tails decay exponentially, which would make Mn grow like sqrt(2n log n), but even then, divided by sqrt(n) would still go to zero. But even for more general variables with finite fourth moments, the tail decay is at least polynomial, which would make Mn grow like n^{1/4} or similar, but divided by sqrt(n) would still go to zero. 

Wait, let me think. If X has finite fourth moment, then P(X > t) decays at least as t^{-4} for large t. Therefore, the tail is polynomial. So, Mn, the maximum of n such variables, would be roughly of order n^{1/4}, since for each Xi, the probability that Xi > n^{1/4} is about n^{-1}, so the expected number of Xi exceeding n^{1/4} is 1, so Mn is around n^{1/4}. Therefore, Mn / sqrt(n) is n^{1/4}/n^{1/2} = n^{-1/4}, which tends to zero. Therefore, this heuristic suggests that Mn / sqrt(n) tends to zero, which aligns with our previous conclusion. 

Therefore, combining all these approaches—using Markov's inequality, union bound, Borel-Cantelli lemma, and tail behavior—it seems that Mn / sqrt(n) does indeed converge to zero in probability. 

But let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, could the fourth moment being finite not be sufficient? Suppose the random variables have very heavy tails, but still finite fourth moments. Wait, but if the fourth moment is finite, the tails cannot be heavier than 1/t^4. For example, if X has a tail like 1/t^5, then E[X^4] would be finite, but 1/t^5 decays faster than 1/t^4. Wait, actually, if the tail is heavier than 1/t^4, then the fourth moment would be infinite. Therefore, if the fourth moment is finite, the tail decay is at least as fast as 1/t^4. Therefore, Mn, the maximum, would be of order n^{1/4}, as I thought. 

Therefore, the tail probability for Mn is P(Mn > t) ≈ n P(X1 > t) ≈ n / t^4. So, if we set t = ε sqrt(n), then P(Mn > ε sqrt(n)) ≈ n / (ε^4 n^2) ) = 1/(ε^4 n), which tends to zero as n → ∞. 

Therefore, all these methods confirm that the probability tends to zero. Hence, Mn / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability. 

I think that's thorough. Let me just recap the steps:

1. Express the probability that the maximum exceeds ε sqrt(n) using the union bound.
2. Use Markov's inequality to bound P(X1 > ε sqrt(n)) by E[X1^4]/(ε^4 n^2).
3. Multiply by n to get the upper bound on the probability, which is 1/(ε^4 n).
4. Conclude that this upper bound tends to zero as n → ∞.
5. Therefore, the probability that Mn / sqrt(n) exceeds ε tends to zero, hence convergence in probability holds.

Alternatively, using the Borel-Cantelli lemma, since the sum of P(Xn > ε sqrt(n)) converges, the event ""Xn > ε sqrt(n)"" happens only finitely often almost surely, so Mn / sqrt(n) is eventually less than ε, leading to almost sure convergence, which implies convergence in probability.

Either way, the conclusion is the same. Therefore, the answer should be yes, the supremum of Xi / sqrt(n) tends to zero in probability.

","Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that X₁, X₂, ... are independent and identically distributed positive random variables with E[X_i^4] < ∞, does the supremum of X_i / sqrt(n) over i from 1 to n converge to 0 in probability? The question is asking whether, as n becomes large, the largest value among X₁/sqrt(n), X₂/sqrt(n), ..., X_n/sqrt(n) gets close to 0 with high probability. 

First, I need to recall what convergence in probability means. If a sequence of random variables Y_n converges to 0 in probability, then for any ε > 0, P(|Y_n| > ε) → 0 as n → ∞. So here, we need to check whether P(sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) > ε) → 0 for any ε > 0.

Hmm, so let's denote Y_n = sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n). We need to show that P(Y_n > ε) → 0 for any ε > 0. Alternatively, maybe there's a way to bound this probability using some inequalities.

Since the X_i are i.i.d., the maximum of them, say M_n = max(X₁, X₂, ..., X_n), has a known distribution. Maybe I can find the tail probability P(M_n > sqrt(n) ε) and then analyze its behavior as n grows.

Let me think. For the maximum of n i.i.d. variables, P(M_n > t) = 1 - P(X₁ ≤ t)^n. So in this case, t = sqrt(n) ε, so P(M_n > sqrt(n) ε) = 1 - [P(X₁ ≤ sqrt(n) ε)]^n.

But how does this behave as n becomes large? Since X_i are positive and we have a finite fourth moment, maybe we can use Markov's inequality or Chebyshev's inequality to bound the tail probability.

Wait, Markov's inequality states that P(X₁ > a) ≤ E[X₁^4] / a^4. But here, a = sqrt(n) ε, so P(X₁ > sqrt(n) ε) ≤ E[X₁^4] / (n^2 ε^4). Therefore, P(M_n > sqrt(n) ε) = 1 - [1 - P(X₁ > sqrt(n) ε)]^n ≤ 1 - [1 - E[X₁^4] / (n^2 ε^4)]^n.

But then, as n becomes large, the term inside the brackets is approximately 1 - E[X₁^4]/(n^2 ε^4), so [1 - E[X₁^4]/(n^2 ε^4)]^n. Let's approximate this using the exponential function. Remember that for small x, (1 - x)^n ≈ e^{-n x}. So here, x = E[X₁^4]/(n^2 ε^4), so n x = E[X₁^4]/(n ε^4). As n → ∞, this term goes to 0 because n ε^4 is in the denominator. Therefore, [1 - E[X₁^4]/(n^2 ε^4)]^n ≈ e^{-E[X₁^4]/(n ε^4)}, which approaches 1 as n → ∞. Therefore, 1 - [1 - E[X₁^4]/(n^2 ε^4)]^n ≈ 1 - e^{-E[X₁^4]/(n ε^4)} → 0 as n → ∞. So P(M_n > sqrt(n) ε) → 0, which would imply that Y_n → 0 in probability. Wait, but is this correct?

Wait, but hold on. The approximation [1 - x]^n ≈ e^{-n x} holds when n x is small. In our case, x = E[X₁^4]/(n^2 ε^4), so n x = E[X₁^4]/(n ε^4). As n increases, n x does go to 0, so the approximation is valid. Therefore, the probability P(M_n > sqrt(n) ε) is approximately 1 - e^{-E[X₁^4]/(n ε^4)}, which indeed tends to 0 as n → ∞. Therefore, Y_n = sup X_i / sqrt(n) tends to 0 in probability. So the answer should be yes, it holds in probability.

But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in the approximation. Alternatively, maybe I can use the union bound. For each ε > 0, P(Y_n > ε) = P(max X_i > sqrt(n) ε) ≤ sum_{i=1}^n P(X_i > sqrt(n) ε) = n P(X_1 > sqrt(n) ε). Then, using Markov's inequality again, P(X_1 > sqrt(n) ε) ≤ E[X_1^4] / (sqrt(n) ε)^4 = E[X_1^4] / (n^2 ε^4). Therefore, n P(X_1 > sqrt(n) ε) ≤ n * E[X_1^4] / (n^2 ε^4) = E[X_1^4] / (n ε^4). As n → ∞, this upper bound tends to 0. Therefore, by the union bound, P(Y_n > ε) ≤ E[X_1^4] / (n ε^4) → 0. Therefore, this directly shows that Y_n → 0 in probability. So this seems more straightforward.

Yes, using the union bound is a better approach here. Since the events {X_i > sqrt(n) ε} are disjoint for each i, the union bound gives P(max X_i > sqrt(n) ε) ≤ sum P(X_i > sqrt(n) ε) = n P(X_1 > sqrt(n) ε). Then, applying Markov's inequality as above, we get the upper bound which tends to 0 as n increases. Therefore, regardless of the value of ε, the probability that any X_i exceeds sqrt(n) ε becomes negligible as n grows, so the supremum tends to 0 in probability.

But wait, let me verify if the union bound is applicable here. The events {X_i > sqrt(n) ε} are not disjoint, but since we are taking the union, the union bound still holds: P(Union A_i) ≤ sum P(A_i). So even though the events are not disjoint, the upper bound is still valid. Therefore, the union bound gives a valid upper bound for the probability that the maximum exceeds sqrt(n) ε. Therefore, the reasoning is correct.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Borel-Cantelli lemma. If we consider the events A_n = {X_n > sqrt(n) ε}, then the probability P(A_n) = P(X_n > sqrt(n) ε) ≤ E[X_n^4] / (sqrt(n) ε)^4 = C / n^2 ε^4, where C = E[X_1^4]. Then, sum_{n=1}^∞ P(A_n) converges because the series sum 1/n^2 converges. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli lemma, the events A_n occur only finitely often almost surely. Therefore, for sufficiently large n, X_n ≤ sqrt(n) ε, which would imply that the supremum over X_i / sqrt(n) is dominated by the last term, but this might not directly give the convergence in probability. Wait, maybe not exactly. The Borel-Cantelli tells us that almost surely, only finitely many A_n occur, so for large n, X_n ≤ sqrt(n) ε. But the supremum over i=1,...,n of X_i / sqrt(n) is the maximum up to n, so even if the last few terms are small, the previous terms could have been large. However, since the sum converges, the probability that any A_n occurs for n ≥ N is ≤ sum_{n=N}^∞ P(A_n) < ε for large N. But this might not directly give the convergence in probability. However, the earlier approach using the union bound and Markov's inequality seems more straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the law of large numbers or something else, but the question is about the supremum, not the average. So the key is to bound the tail probability that any X_i exceeds sqrt(n) ε, which we can do via the union bound and Markov's inequality.

Another way to think about it: Since X_i are identically distributed, the maximum M_n = max(X₁, ..., X_n). Then, for any ε > 0, we need to show that P(M_n / sqrt(n) > ε) → 0. Let's write this as P(M_n > sqrt(n) ε). Then, using the same approach as before, P(M_n > sqrt(n) ε) = 1 - [P(X₁ ≤ sqrt(n) ε)]^n. But perhaps we can use the tail bound for the maximum. For i.i.d. variables, the tail of the maximum is related to the tail of each variable. For example, for heavy-tailed distributions, the maximum might grow differently, but here we have finite fourth moment, so the tails are not too heavy.

Alternatively, since E[X_i^4] < ∞, the variables have exponential tails? Not necessarily, but they have polynomial tails at most. For example, a distribution with E[X^4] < ∞ must have P(X > t) decaying at least like 1/t^4 as t → ∞. So, for t = sqrt(n) ε, P(X > t) ≤ C / t^4 = C / (n^2 ε^4). Therefore, the same as before.

Therefore, using the union bound, P(M_n > sqrt(n) ε) ≤ n * C / (n^2 ε^4) = C / (n ε^4) → 0. Therefore, the probability goes to 0, so M_n / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability.

Wait, but let me check with an example. Suppose X_i are standard normal variables, so E[X_i^4] = 3. Then, for ε > 0, P(X_i > sqrt(n) ε) ≈ 1 - Φ(sqrt(n) ε), where Φ is the standard normal CDF. The tail probability for normal is approximately 1/sqrt(2π n ε^2)} e^{-n ε^2 / 2}, which decays like e^{-n ε^2 / 2}, so the union bound would give sum_{i=1}^n e^{-n ε^2 / 2} = n e^{-n ε^2 / 2}, which still decays exponentially. So in this case, the probability that sup X_i / sqrt(n) > ε is exponentially small, which certainly tends to 0. So in this case, the statement holds.

Another example: suppose X_i are Exp(1) variables, so E[X_i^4] = 24. Then, P(X_i > sqrt(n) ε) = e^{-sqrt(n) ε}. Then, the union bound gives n e^{-sqrt(n) ε}, which also decays faster than any polynomial, so again tends to 0. Therefore, in these examples, the statement holds.

But what if the variables have a heavier tail? Wait, but we are given that E[X_i^4] < ∞, so the tails cannot be heavier than 1/t^4. For example, if X_i follows a distribution with P(X > t) ≈ C / t^4, then the tail decays like 1/t^4. Then, P(X_i > sqrt(n) ε) ≈ C / (n^2 ε^4), so the union bound gives n * C / (n^2 ε^4) = C / (n ε^4), which still tends to 0.

Therefore, regardless of the specific distribution, as long as the fourth moment is finite, the tail probabilities decay sufficiently fast that the union bound upper bound tends to 0. Therefore, the supremum X_i / sqrt(n) converges to 0 in probability.

But let me check if there's a case where even with finite fourth moment, the supremum doesn't go to 0. Suppose X_i has a distribution where P(X_i > t) = 1/(t^4) for t ≥ 1, and 0 otherwise. Then, E[X_i^4] = ∫_1^∞ 4/t^5 dt = 4/4 = 1, which is finite. Then, for t = sqrt(n) ε, P(X_i > sqrt(n) ε) = 1/(sqrt(n) ε)^4 = 1/(n^2 ε^4). Then, the union bound gives n * 1/(n^2 ε^4) = 1/(n ε^4) → 0. So even in this case, the probability goes to 0. Therefore, the conclusion holds.

Another edge case: suppose X_i is a constant, say X_i = C almost surely. Then, sup X_i / sqrt(n) = C / sqrt(n) → 0. So even in deterministic case, it holds.

Therefore, seems like in all cases with E[X_i^4] < ∞, the supremum X_i / sqrt(n) tends to 0 in probability. So the answer is yes, it does hold in probability.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose X_i are Pareto distributed with shape parameter α > 4, so that E[X_i^4] < ∞. Then, P(X_i > t) = (t_0 / t)^α for t ≥ t_0. But even here, for t = sqrt(n) ε, P(X_i > sqrt(n) ε) = (t_0 / sqrt(n) ε)^α. Then, the union bound gives n * (t_0 / sqrt(n) ε)^α = n^{1 - α/2} / ε^α. If α > 4, then 1 - α/2 < -1, so n^{1 - α/2} decays rapidly. Therefore, the probability goes to 0.

But if α ≤ 4, then even with finite fourth moment? Wait, no. If α < 4, then E[X_i^4] would be infinite. For example, if α = 3, then E[X_i^4] = ∫_{t_0}^∞ t^4 * α t_0^{-α} t^{-α -1} dt = α t_0^{-α} ∫_{t_0}^∞ t^{3 - α} dt, which diverges if α ≤ 3. So only when α > 4, E[X_i^4] < ∞. Therefore, in such cases, the tail probabilities decay polynomially, and the union bound would still work as above.

Therefore, in all cases where E[X_i^4] < ∞, the tail probabilities decay sufficiently fast that the union bound gives a decaying probability, leading to the conclusion that the supremum tends to 0 in probability.

Therefore, after all these checks and examples, I can conclude that the statement holds true. So the answer is yes, it does hold in probability.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if the supremum of X_i divided by sqrt(n) goes to zero in probability as n approaches infinity. The variables are i.i.d. positive with finite fourth moments. Hmm. Let me start by recalling what ""in probability"" means here. A sequence of random variables Y_n converges to zero in probability if, for any ε > 0, P(|Y_n| > ε) → 0 as n → ∞. So in this case, Y_n would be the supremum over i from 1 to n of X_i / sqrt(n). I need to show that the probability that this supremum exceeds some ε tends to zero.

First, maybe I can consider the maximum of the X_i's. The supremum is just the maximum, right? So I need to look at the maximum of n i.i.d. variables and see how it behaves when divided by sqrt(n). Let me denote M_n = max{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n}. Then, the question is whether P(M_n / sqrt(n) > ε) → 0 for any ε > 0.

To handle this, I think I can use the union bound. The probability that the maximum exceeds ε*sqrt(n) is less than or equal to the sum of the probabilities that each X_i exceeds ε*sqrt(n). Since they are i.i.d., this sum is n*P(X_1 > ε*sqrt(n)).

So, P(M_n / sqrt(n) > ε) = P(M_n > ε*sqrt(n)) ≤ n*P(X_1 > ε*sqrt(n)).

Now, I need to evaluate P(X_1 > ε*sqrt(n)). Since X_1 has finite fourth moments, maybe I can use Markov's inequality here. Markov's inequality says that P(X ≥ a) ≤ E[X^k] / a^k for any a > 0 and k > 0. Let's take k=4, since we know E[X^4] is finite.

Therefore, P(X_1 > ε*sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4] / (ε*sqrt(n))^4 = E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n^2).

So substituting back into the previous inequality:

P(M_n / sqrt(n) > ε) ≤ n * [E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n^2)] = E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n).

As n tends to infinity, this upper bound tends to zero. Therefore, for any ε > 0, the probability that the supremum exceeds ε*sqrt(n) is bounded by a term that goes to zero. Therefore, by the definition of convergence in probability, we can conclude that the supremum converges to zero in probability.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using tail probabilities or some other inequality. For example, if we can find a better bound on P(X_1 > ε*sqrt(n)), we might need to consider the tail behavior. However, since we only know that the fourth moment is finite, Markov's inequality is straightforward here. Even if the tail probabilities decay faster, Markov's inequality gives us an upper bound that's sufficient for the convergence in probability.

Alternatively, maybe using Chebyshev's inequality? But Chebyshev is for the variance, and here we are dealing with the maximum. Wait, the maximum is a non-linear functional, so maybe Chebyshev isn't directly applicable. The union bound approach seems more straightforward here.

Another thought: if we can use the Borel-Cantelli lemma. For the events A_n = {X_n > ε*sqrt(n)}, the probability of A_n is P(X_n > ε*sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_n^4]/(ε*sqrt(n))^4 as before. So the sum over n of P(A_n) is sum_{n=1}^∞ E[X^4]/(ε^4 n^2), which converges because the series 1/n^2 converges. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many A_n occur. This would imply that for large n, X_n ≤ ε*sqrt(n), so the maximum up to n would be bounded by ε*sqrt(n) for sufficiently large n. But wait, this is almost sure convergence, but the question is about convergence in probability. However, since the probability of the event that infinitely many A_n occur is zero, then the maximum M_n / sqrt(n) is eventually less than ε almost surely. Therefore, in probability, the supremum would be zero. But maybe this is overcomplicating?

Wait, the Borel-Cantelli approach gives almost sure convergence, but the question is about convergence in probability. However, almost sure convergence implies convergence in probability, so if we can show almost sure convergence, then convergence in probability follows. But is that necessary here?

Alternatively, maybe using the law of large numbers. But the maximum isn't directly covered by the LLN. The LLN talks about averages, not maxima. So perhaps not directly applicable.

Alternatively, consider that for the maximum, we can use the fact that if the variables are i.i.d., then the logarithm of the maximum can be approximated, but that might be more advanced. For simplicity, the union bound and Markov's inequality seem sufficient here.

So, to recap:

1. Let M_n = max(X_1, ..., X_n). We need P(M_n / sqrt(n) > ε) → 0.

2. Use union bound: P(M_n > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ n P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)).

3. Apply Markov's inequality: P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n^2).

4. Substitute: n * E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n^2) = E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n) → 0 as n → ∞.

Therefore, the probability tends to zero, so M_n / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability.

Hence, the answer should be yes, it does hold in probability.

","Okay, so I need to determine if the supremum of X_i divided by sqrt(n) tends to zero in probability. Let's see. The variables are i.i.d. positive with the fourth moment finite. Hmm.

First, let me recall what convergence in probability means. For a sequence of random variables Y_n, if for every ε > 0, P(|Y_n| > ε) → 0 as n → ∞, then Y_n → 0 in probability. So in this case, we need to check if the probability that the supremum of X_i / sqrt(n) over i=1 to n is greater than ε tends to zero as n goes to infinity.

The supremum here is the maximum of X_1, X_2, ..., X_n divided by sqrt(n). So, if we let M_n = max{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n}, then we need to check if M_n / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability.

So, the problem reduces to showing that P(M_n / sqrt(n) > ε) → 0 for any ε > 0. Let's write that as P(M_n > ε sqrt(n)) → 0.

Hmm. To analyze this, maybe I can use the properties of the maximum of i.i.d. variables. For the maximum, we know that P(M_n ≤ x) = [P(X_1 ≤ x)]^n, assuming independence. Therefore, P(M_n > x) = 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ x)]^n.

So, substituting x = ε sqrt(n), we get P(M_n > ε sqrt(n)) = 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ ε sqrt(n))]^n.

Our goal is to show that this probability tends to zero as n → ∞.

Let me denote p_n = P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)). Then, P(M_n > ε sqrt(n)) = 1 - (1 - p_n)^n.

So, if we can show that (1 - p_n)^n → 1 as n → ∞, then the probability tends to zero. To do this, we need to analyze the behavior of p_n as n grows.

Given that X_i are i.i.d. with E[X_i^4] < ∞, they are sub-Gaussian? Or maybe just have light tails. Since the fourth moment is finite, the tails decay at least as fast as 1/x^5? Wait, actually, for a positive random variable with E[X^4] < ∞, the tail decay can be determined via Markov's inequality.

By Markov's inequality, P(X_1 > x) ≤ E[X_1^4] / x^4. So, for x = ε sqrt(n), we have p_n ≤ E[X_1^4] / (ε sqrt(n))^4 = E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n^2).

Therefore, p_n ≤ C / n^2 for some constant C = E[X_1^4] / ε^4. Then, (1 - p_n)^n ≥ (1 - C/n^2)^n. As n becomes large, (1 - C/n^2)^n approaches e^{-C/n}, which tends to 1 as n → ∞. Therefore, 1 - (1 - p_n)^n ≤ 1 - e^{-C/n} ≈ C/n for large n. Hence, P(M_n > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ C/n, which tends to zero as n → ∞. Therefore, the probability tends to zero, so the supremum divided by sqrt(n) tends to zero in probability.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me verify the steps.

First, we have p_n = P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4] / (ε sqrt(n))^4 by Markov's inequality. That's correct because Markov's inequality states that P(X ≥ t) ≤ E[X^4]/t^4 for t > 0. So yes, substituting t = ε sqrt(n), that gives p_n ≤ C / n^2.

Then, (1 - p_n)^n ≥ (1 - C/n^2)^n. Now, (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a} as n → ∞. So here, a = C/n, so (1 - C/n^2)^n ≈ e^{-C/n} → 1 as n → ∞. Therefore, 1 - (1 - p_n)^n ≤ 1 - e^{-C/n} ≈ C/n, which does go to zero. Hence, the probability P(M_n > ε sqrt(n)) is bounded by something that tends to zero.

Therefore, for any ε > 0, P(M_n / sqrt(n) > ε) → 0, which means M_n / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there's a mistake here. Let's see. Suppose the variables are heavy-tailed, but in this case, the fourth moment is finite, so they can't be too heavy-tailed. Since the tail decays at least as x^{-5} (if they are like a Pareto with exponent 5). Wait, actually, Markov's inequality gives p_n ≤ E[X_1^4]/(ε^4 n^2), so the tail is decaying as 1/n^2. So even if the variables are heavy-tailed, as long as E[X^4] is finite, the tail is not too heavy. So this would imply that the probability that the maximum exceeds ε sqrt(n) decays as 1/n, which is summable. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, the events that X_n > ε sqrt(n) happen only finitely many times, which would imply that eventually, all X_i are less than ε sqrt(n), hence the supremum is less than ε sqrt(n). Wait, but Borel-Cantelli would apply if the sum of the probabilities is finite. The sum over n of p_n = sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(X_n > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ sum_{n=1}^\\infty C/n^2, which converges. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely only finitely many X_n exceed ε sqrt(n). Therefore, for large n, all X_i are less than ε sqrt(n), so the supremum is less than ε sqrt(n), hence the supremum over i=1,...,n is less than ε sqrt(n). Therefore, the supremum divided by sqrt(n) is less than ε, so for large n, the supremum is less than ε with probability 1. Therefore, in probability, it converges to zero.

But wait, the original question was about the supremum over i=1,...,n of X_i / sqrt(n). So, if almost surely, for large enough n, all X_i are less than ε sqrt(n), then the maximum is less than ε sqrt(n), so the supremum is less than ε sqrt(n), hence the supremum divided by sqrt(n) is less than ε. Therefore, for any ε > 0, there exists N such that for all n > N, P(sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) > ε) = 0. Therefore, convergence in probability is stronger than almost sure convergence here. Wait, but in probability, convergence just requires that for any ε, the probability tends to zero, whether it's almost sure or just in probability. But in this case, if the events happen only finitely often, then the probability that it happens infinitely often is zero, so for large n, the probability that it happens is zero. Therefore, in probability, it's equivalent to almost sure convergence. But in any case, the conclusion is that the probability tends to zero.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the supremum tends to zero in probability.

But let me check with another approach. Maybe using Chebyshev or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that for i.i.d. variables, the maximum scales with n^{1/m} where m is related to the tail. But since E[X^4] is finite, the tails are light enough that the maximum grows slower than n^{1/4}, but here we are dividing by n^{1/2}, so the ratio should go to zero.

Alternatively, using the general result that for i.i.d. variables with E[X^p] < ∞, the maximum of n variables is O(n^{1/p}) in probability. Wait, is that a theorem?

Yes, there is a result that if E[X_i^p] < ∞ for some p > 0, then the maximum of n i.i.d. copies is O(n^{1/p}) in probability. So if p=4, then maximum is O(n^{1/4}), so dividing by n^{1/2} would give O(n^{-1/4}), which tends to zero. Therefore, this is a general result, so the answer is yes.

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, the supremum tends to zero in probability.

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether the supremum of X_i divided by sqrt(n) tends to zero in probability. The variables X_1, X_2, etc., are independent and identically distributed positive random variables with finite fourth moments. Hmm. Let me start by recalling some probability concepts.

First, the question is about the convergence in probability of the supremum. That means, for any epsilon > 0, the probability that the supremum is greater than epsilon should go to zero as n approaches infinity. So, I need to show that P(sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) > epsilon) tends to zero as n becomes large.

Let's denote the supremum as M_n = max{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n}. Then, the problem reduces to showing that M_n / sqrt(n) converges to zero in probability. So, equivalently, for any epsilon > 0, P(M_n / sqrt(n) > epsilon) → 0 as n → ∞.

Since M_n is the maximum of n i.i.d. variables, the distribution of M_n can be analyzed using the tail probabilities. That is, P(M_n > a) = 1 - P(M_n ≤ a) = 1 - P(X_1 ≤ a)^n. So, if we set a = epsilon * sqrt(n), then P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) = 1 - P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))^n.

Therefore, the probability we're interested in is 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n. We need this to go to zero as n increases. So, we need to analyze the behavior of [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n as n becomes large.

To do this, maybe I can use the Markov inequality or Chebyshev's inequality? But since we have a fourth moment, perhaps we can use that. Let's recall that for any random variable, P(X > t) ≤ E[X^4]/t^4. Maybe we can use that here.

Wait, let me think. If X_1 has finite fourth moment, then for any t > 0, P(X_1 > t) ≤ E[X_1^4]/t^4. So, if we let t = epsilon * sqrt(n), then P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2). Therefore, the probability that X_1 exceeds epsilon * sqrt(n) is bounded by a term that's O(1/n^2).

But how does this help us? Since we have the maximum, the probability that the maximum exceeds epsilon * sqrt(n) is less than or equal to n * P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)) by the union bound. So, P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≤ n * E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n^2) ) = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 * n). As n tends to infinity, this goes to zero. So, does this mean that the probability tends to zero?

Wait, but this seems too quick. Because the union bound gives an upper bound, but is this tight? If the upper bound tends to zero, then the probability itself must tend to zero. So, in this case, since the upper bound is E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n), which goes to zero, then indeed the probability tends to zero. Therefore, the supremum over i=1,...,n of X_i / sqrt(n) converges to zero in probability.

But wait, let me check if there's a mistake here. The fourth moment is finite, so E[X_1^4] is a constant. So, as n increases, the upper bound is proportional to 1/n, which indeed goes to zero. Therefore, the conclusion is that the probability that the maximum divided by sqrt(n) exceeds epsilon tends to zero. So, the answer is yes.

But wait, let me think again. Suppose we have variables with heavy tails. But in this case, since the fourth moment is finite, the tails are not too heavy. So, the tail probabilities decay at least as fast as 1/t^4, which is faster than polynomial decay. So, the union bound gives a decay rate of 1/n. Therefore, the probability decays like 1/n, so the convergence in probability holds.

Alternatively, maybe we can use another approach. For example, using the fact that the maximum of i.i.d. variables, when properly scaled, converges in distribution to some limit. But here, the scaling is by sqrt(n). So, if the variables have finite fourth moments, perhaps the maximum scales like some power of n?

Wait, but for i.i.d. variables with finite fourth moments, the maximum M_n is known to satisfy that M_n / n^{1/4} converges in probability to some constant? Wait, actually, for distributions with power-law tails, the scaling is different. But if the fourth moment is finite, then the tails are not too heavy. For example, sub-Gaussian variables would have tails decaying exponentially, but even for sub-exponential variables, the tail probabilities decay polynomially.

But in any case, the standard approach for the maximum is to use the fact that for any t > 0, P(M_n > t) = 1 - (1 - P(X_1 > t))^n. Let's set t = epsilon * sqrt(n). Then, P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) = 1 - (1 - P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)))^n.

Now, if we can approximate (1 - P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)))^n using a logarithm. Let's take the logarithm: log(1 - p(n))^n ≈ n log(1 - p(n)) ≈ -n p(n) if p(n) is small. So, if p(n) = P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)) is small, then the probability becomes approximately 1 - e^{-n p(n)}.

But from the Markov inequality, p(n) ≤ E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2). Therefore, n p(n) ≤ E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n). So, as n increases, n p(n) → 0. Therefore, e^{-n p(n)} ≈ 1 - n p(n). Therefore, 1 - e^{-n p(n)} ≈ n p(n). Therefore, the probability P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≈ n p(n) ≤ E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n) → 0 as n → ∞.

Therefore, the probability tends to zero. Therefore, the supremum of X_i / sqrt(n) converges to zero in probability.

Wait, but this seems to depend on the fourth moment. If the fourth moment were infinite, would this result still hold? Probably not. For example, if X_i has a Pareto distribution with tail exponent less than 4, then the fourth moment is infinite. Then, the tail probabilities decay slower, and the same approach would not give a decaying upper bound. However, in our case, since the fourth moment is finite, the tail probabilities decay at least as 1/t^4, which is sufficient for the upper bound to decay as 1/n, leading the probability to zero.

Alternatively, another approach could be to use the Borel-Cantelli lemma. If the sum of the probabilities that X_i > epsilon * sqrt(n) is finite, then by Borel-Cantelli, only finitely many such events occur, implying that for sufficiently large n, all X_i ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). However, in our case, we are dealing with a fixed n and considering the supremum over i=1,...,n. So, Borel-Cantelli might not directly apply here, but perhaps gives an intuition.

Wait, but if we fix epsilon > 0, then for each n, the probability that X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n) is p_n = P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2). Then, the sum over n of p_n is sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^2, which converges. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, only finitely many X_n exceed epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, for sufficiently large n, all X_n ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, for large n, the maximum M_n = max{X_1, ..., X_n} is ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, M_n / sqrt(n) ≤ epsilon. Therefore, for any epsilon > 0, there exists N such that for n ≥ N, P(M_n / sqrt(n) > epsilon) = 0. Wait, this seems too strong. Because Borel-Cantelli tells us that almost surely, only finitely many X_n exceed epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, for large n, all X_n ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, the maximum up to n would be ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). Wait, but this seems like a contradiction unless the variables are deterministic. Wait, no, because Borel-Cantelli says that with probability 1, only finitely many X_n exceed epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, for each epsilon > 0, almost surely, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, X_n ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, the maximum from N onwards is ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). But the maximum up to n could be the maximum up to N, which might be larger. Wait, but no, the maximum up to n is the maximum of X_1, ..., X_n. If for n ≥ N, X_n ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n), but the previous terms could be larger. Wait, but if n is large, then epsilon * sqrt(n) is also large. However, the previous terms, say X_k for k ≤ N, could be larger than epsilon * sqrt(n) for large n, but epsilon is fixed. Wait, let's think carefully.

Suppose we fix epsilon > 0. Let N be such that for n ≥ N, X_n ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n) almost surely. Wait, but Borel-Cantelli tells us that the event ""there are infinitely many n with X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)"" has probability zero. Therefore, almost surely, there exists some N such that for all n ≥ N, X_n ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). However, the maximum up to n is the maximum of X_1, ..., X_n. So, even if for n ≥ N, X_n is small, the maximum could still be determined by some X_k where k ≤ N. But as n increases, sqrt(n) increases, so even if X_k is fixed, say X_k = M, then for n large enough, epsilon * sqrt(n) > M. Therefore, for sufficiently large n, the maximum M_n is ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). Because the maximum is either from the first N variables (which are ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n) for n ≥ N) or from the remaining variables which are ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, for n ≥ N, M_n ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, for each epsilon > 0, almost surely, for all n ≥ N, M_n / sqrt(n) ≤ epsilon. Therefore, the supremum over i=1,...,n of X_i / sqrt(n) converges to zero in probability, even almost surely.

Wait, but this seems to suggest almost sure convergence, but the question is about convergence in probability. But if almost sure convergence implies convergence in probability, then the answer would be yes. However, in our case, the conclusion from Borel-Cantelli seems to give almost sure convergence, but the user is asking for convergence in probability. So, if the conclusion from Borel-Cantelli is stronger, then the answer is yes.

But let me check again. If we fix epsilon > 0, then almost surely, there exists N such that for all n ≥ N, X_n ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). However, the maximum M_n is the maximum of X_1, X_2, ..., X_n. Even if for n ≥ N, X_n ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n), the maximum could be the maximum of X_1, ..., X_{N}. But X_1, ..., X_{N} are fixed after N. So, for example, if X_1 was some large value, then even for n ≥ N, M_n would be the maximum of X_1, ..., X_{N}, which could be larger than epsilon * sqrt(n). Wait, but epsilon is fixed, and n is going to infinity. So, if n is large enough, epsilon * sqrt(n) would be larger than the maximum of X_1, ..., X_{N}. Because sqrt(n) increases to infinity. Therefore, for n sufficiently large, epsilon * sqrt(n) > M, where M is the maximum of X_1, ..., X_{N}. Therefore, for n > N', where N' is such that epsilon * sqrt(N') > M, then M_n = max{X_1, ..., X_n} ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, almost surely, for n > N', M_n / sqrt(n) ≤ epsilon. Therefore, the supremum over i=1,...,n of X_i / sqrt(n) is ≤ epsilon for all n > N'. Therefore, almost surely, limsup_{n→∞} sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) ≤ epsilon. Since epsilon is arbitrary, the limsup is zero almost surely, which implies convergence to zero in probability.

Therefore, both approaches, using Markov's inequality and Borel-Cantelli, lead to the conclusion that the supremum converges to zero in probability. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But wait, let me check if there's a mistake in the reasoning. For example, suppose we have X_i with finite fourth moment but not necessarily symmetric. But the i.i.d. assumption is given, and the fourth moment is finite, so the tail probabilities decay at least as 1/t^4. Therefore, the upper bound using Markov's inequality is valid. Therefore, the union bound gives a decay rate of 1/n, which is summable, hence Borel-Cantelli applies, leading to almost sure convergence. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.

Alternatively, if the variables had a different tail behavior, say exponentially decaying tails, then the same reasoning would hold, but even more so. However, in our case, the fourth moment is finite, which is a weaker condition than exponential tails. So, the result still holds.

Another way to think about it is to consider the expectation of the maximum. If we can show that E[M_n] / sqrt(n) → 0, then by Markov's inequality, the probability would go to zero. But calculating E[M_n] for i.i.d. variables with finite fourth moments is non-trivial. However, for such variables, it's known that the maximum scales like n^{1/4}, but wait, is that the case?

Wait, actually, for i.i.d. variables with finite fourth moments, the maximum M_n is of order n^{1/4} almost surely. Wait, no, that's for different scaling. Wait, for example, in the case of Gaussian variables, the maximum scales like sqrt(2 log n). But for other distributions, the scaling can be different. However, if the fourth moment is finite, the tails are not too heavy. Let's see, for example, if X_i has a distribution where P(X_i > t) ≤ C / t^4, then the expectation of the maximum can be bounded.

But perhaps this is overcomplicating. The earlier approaches using Markov's inequality and Borel-Cantelli seem sufficient. Since the problem is about convergence in probability, and we have shown that for any epsilon > 0, the probability that sup X_i / sqrt(n) > epsilon tends to zero, then the answer is yes.

Therefore, after considering multiple approaches and verifying the reasoning, I conclude that the supremum does converge to zero in probability.

Given i.i.d. positive random variables \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots\\) with \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_i^4] < \\infty\\), we need to determine if \\(\\sup_{i=1, \\ldots, n} \\frac{X_i}{\\sqrt{n}} \\rightarrow 0\\) in probability.

To analyze this, we consider the maximum \\(M_n = \\max\\{X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\}\\). We need to check if \\(P\\left(\\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} > \\epsilon\\right) \\rightarrow 0\\) for any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).

Using the tail probability, we have:
\\[

Let \\(p_n = P(X_1 > \\epsilon \\sqrt{n})\\). By Markov's inequality:
\\[
p_n \\leq \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4]}{(\\epsilon \\sqrt{n})^4} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4]}{\\epsilon^4 n^2}

Thus, \\(n p_n \\leq \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4]}{\\epsilon^4 n}\\). Since \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4] < \\infty\\), \\(n p_n \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).

Approximating using logarithms:

","Okay, let's try to figure out whether the supremum of \\( \\frac{X_i}{\\sqrt{n}} \\) for \\( i = 1, \\ldots, n \\) converges to zero in probability. Hmm, so we have i.i.d. positive random variables \\( X_1, X_2, \\ldots \\) with finite fourth moments. The question is about the convergence in probability of the maximum of these variables scaled by \\( 1/\\sqrt{n} \\).

First, I need to recall what convergence in probability means. A sequence of random variables \\( Y_n \\) converges to zero in probability if for every \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), \\( P(|Y_n| > \\epsilon) \\to 0 \\) as \\( n \\to \\infty \\). So, in this case, we need to check if for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), the probability that the supremum \\( \\sup_{i=1,\\ldots,n} \\frac{X_i}{\\sqrt{n}} \\) exceeds \\( \\epsilon \\) goes to zero as \\( n \\) becomes large.

Let me denote \\( M_n = \\max\\{X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n\\} \\). Then the supremum in question is \\( \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} \\). So we need to check if \\( \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} \\) converges to zero in probability.

To analyze this, maybe I can use the tail probabilities. For any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), we can write:

\\[
P\\left( \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} > \\epsilon \\right) = P\\left( M_n > \\epsilon \\sqrt{n} \\right) = 1 - P\\left( M_n \\leq \\epsilon \\sqrt{n} \\right) = 1 - \\left( P(X_1 \\leq \\epsilon \\sqrt{n}) \\right)^n
\\]

So, if I can show that \\( \\left( P(X_1 \\leq \\epsilon \\sqrt{n}) \\right)^n \\) approaches 1 as \\( n \\to \\infty \\), then the probability \\( P\\left( \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} > \\epsilon \\right) \\) would approach zero, which is what we want.

Alternatively, if \\( \\left( P(X_1 \\leq \\epsilon \\sqrt{n}) \\right)^n \\) does not approach 1, then the probability might not go to zero. So the key is to analyze the behavior of \\( P(X_1 > \\epsilon \\sqrt{n}) \\) and see how it decays as \\( n \\) increases.

Given that \\( X_i \\) are i.i.d. with finite fourth moments, we can use Markov's inequality. For any \\( t > 0 \\),

\\[
P(X_1 > t) \\leq \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4]}{t^4}
\\]

So, applying this to \\( t = \\epsilon \\sqrt{n} \\),

\\[
P(X_1 > \\epsilon \\sqrt{n}) \\leq \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4]}{(\\epsilon \\sqrt{n})^4} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4]}{\\epsilon^4 n^2}
\\]

Therefore, the probability that any one \\( X_i \\) exceeds \\( \\epsilon \\sqrt{n} \\) is at most \\( \\frac{C}{n^2} \\), where \\( C = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4]}{\\epsilon^4} \\).

Now, the probability that the maximum \\( M_n \\) exceeds \\( \\epsilon \\sqrt{n} \\) is at most \\( n \\times \\frac{C}{n^2} = \\frac{C}{n} \\). So,

\\[
P\\left( \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} > \\epsilon \\right) \\leq \\frac{C}{n} \\to 0 \\quad \\text{as } n \\to \\infty
\\]

Therefore, for any \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), the probability that \\( \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} \\) exceeds \\( \\epsilon \\) tends to zero. Hence, \\( \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} \\) converges to zero in probability.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. The key step was using Markov's inequality to bound the tail probability and then multiplying by the number of variables. Since we have \\( n \\) variables, each contributing a tail probability of \\( O(1/n^2) \\), the union bound gives \\( O(1/n) \\), which does go to zero. So the conclusion is that \\( \\sup_{i=1,\\ldots,n} \\frac{X_i}{\\sqrt{n}} \\) converges to zero in probability.

But let me think again. Suppose the variables have finite fourth moments. So \\( \\mathbb{E}[X_i^4] < \\infty \\). That gives a certain decay rate for the tail probabilities. Specifically, \\( P(X_i > t) \\leq \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_i^4]}{t^4} \\), which is a polynomial decay. If the tail decay were faster, say exponential, we might have a better bound. But here, polynomial decay is sufficient because when multiplied by \\( n \\), we still get a term that goes to zero.

Alternatively, if the tail decay were slower, like polynomial of degree less than four, the bound might not hold. But since we have fourth moments, this gives us a quartic decay in the tail probability. Therefore, the union bound over \\( n \\) terms gives a total probability of \\( O(n \\times n^{-2}) = O(n^{-1}) \\), which goes to zero.

Therefore, it seems that the answer is yes, the supremum does converge to zero in probability.

But wait, let me check if there's another approach. For example, using the law of large numbers or concentration inequalities. The variables are i.i.d., so maybe we can use the fact that the maximum scales appropriately. For example, in extreme value theory, the maximum of i.i.d. random variables often scales with \\( n \\) in some way, but the scaling here is \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If the variables have finite fourth moments, then their tails are not too heavy, so the maximum should not grow too quickly. But even so, the scaling here is \\( \\sqrt{n} \\), which might be appropriate if the variables have finite variance. Wait, but even if variables have finite variance, the maximum can still be larger. For example, in the case of normal variables, the maximum scales like \\( \\sqrt{2 \\log n} \\), but here we have \\( \\sqrt{n} \\), which is much larger. However, since the variables have finite fourth moments, maybe the maximum is even more controlled.

Wait, another thought: If the variables have finite fourth moments, then by the law of large numbers, \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\sum X_i^4 \\to \\mathbb{E}[X_i^4] \\), so the typical value of \\( X_i^4 \\) is around \\( \\mathbb{E}[X_i^4] \\), so the typical value of \\( X_i \\) is around \\( (\\mathbb{E}[X_i^4])^{1/4} \\). Therefore, the maximum \\( M_n \\) is roughly \\( (\\mathbb{E}[X_i^4])^{1/4} \\times (\\log n)^{1/4} \\), or something like that? Wait, but in that case, \\( M_n / \\sqrt{n} \\) would go to zero because \\( (\\log n)^{1/4} \\) grows much slower than \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). But maybe that's too heuristic.

Alternatively, using the Borel-Cantelli lemma. If the sum over \\( n \\) of \\( P(X_n > \\epsilon \\sqrt{n}) \\) converges, then almost surely only finitely many \\( X_n \\) exceed \\( \\epsilon \\sqrt{n} \\). So, for each \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\), \\( \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(X_n > \\epsilon \\sqrt{n}) \\leq \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\frac{C}{n^2} \\), which converges. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, almost surely, only finitely many \\( X_n \\) exceed \\( \\epsilon \\sqrt{n} \\). Therefore, for sufficiently large \\( n \\), \\( \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} \\leq \\epsilon \\). Hence, \\( \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} \\to 0 \\) almost surely, which implies convergence in probability. So that's another way to see it.

Therefore, combining both approaches, using Markov's inequality and Borel-Cantelli, we can conclude that \\( \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} \\to 0 \\) almost surely, hence in probability.

But the original question was about the supremum over \\( i = 1, \\ldots, n \\) of \\( \\frac{X_i}{\\sqrt{n}} \\). Since \\( M_n = \\max_{i=1}^n X_i \\), then \\( \\sup_{i=1}^n \\frac{X_i}{\\sqrt{n}} = \\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} \\). Therefore, the result holds.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the supremum does converge to zero in probability.

","Okay, so I have this problem here: given that X₁, X₂, ... are independent and identically distributed positive random variables with E[X_i⁴] < ∞, does the supremum of X_i / √n from i=1 to n go to zero in probability? And the answer is supposed to be 2/3? Wait, maybe I misread. Wait, no, the answer is supposed to be 2/3? That doesn't make sense. Wait, the question is asking whether the supremum tends to zero in probability, and the answer is given as 2/3? Hmm, maybe there's a typo. Wait, maybe the original problem had a different exponent or something. But as it stands, the question is about whether the supremum of X_i / √n converges to zero in probability. Let me think.

First, I need to recall what it means for a sequence of random variables to converge to zero in probability. It means that for any ε > 0, the probability that the absolute value of the random variable is greater than ε tends to zero as n approaches infinity. In this case, the random variable is the supremum of X_i / √n for i from 1 to n. So, we need to check if P(sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / √n > ε) → 0 as n → ∞ for any ε > 0.

To analyze this, maybe I can consider the maximum of the X_i, since the supremum is just the maximum in this case because all X_i are positive. So, let's denote M_n = max{X₁, X₂, ..., X_n}. Then, the supremum in question is M_n / √n. We need to see if M_n / √n → 0 in probability.

So, the probability that M_n / √n > ε is the same as the probability that M_n > ε√n. Therefore, we need to compute P(M_n > ε√n) and check if this tends to zero as n → ∞.

Since the X_i are i.i.d., the probability that all X_i ≤ ε√n is (P(X₁ ≤ ε√n))ⁿ. Therefore, the probability that at least one X_i exceeds ε√n is 1 - (P(X₁ ≤ ε√n))ⁿ. So, P(M_n > ε√n) = 1 - (P(X₁ ≤ ε√n))ⁿ.

We need to analyze the limit of this expression as n → ∞. If this limit is zero, then M_n / √n → 0 in probability.

To proceed, maybe I can use the Markov inequality. Since E[X_i⁴] < ∞, perhaps we can bound P(X_i > ε√n) using Markov's inequality. Let's see.

By Markov's inequality, P(X_i > ε√n) ≤ E[X_i⁴] / (ε⁴ n²). Because X_i is positive, and we are dealing with X_i⁴ here. So, P(X_i > ε√n) ≤ E[X_i⁴] / (ε⁴ n²). Therefore, the probability that any of the X_i exceeds ε√n is at most n * E[X_i⁴] / (ε⁴ n²) = E[X_i⁴] / (ε⁴ n). So, as n → ∞, this upper bound tends to zero. Therefore, the probability that M_n > ε√n is bounded by E[X_i⁴]/(ε⁴ n), which tends to zero as n → ∞. Therefore, the supremum M_n / √n does tend to zero in probability.

Wait, but the answer given is 2/3. That seems conflicting. Maybe the question was different? Let me check again. The user wrote: ""Assume X₁, X₂, ... are i.i.d. positive random variables with E[X_i⁴] < ∞. Does sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) → 0 hold in probability? 2/3"". Hmm, maybe there was a typo, and the user meant to ask about convergence in another sense, or maybe the answer is 2/3 for another part. Alternatively, maybe the exponent is different. Wait, if the variables were normalized by n^{1/4} instead of sqrt(n), then maybe something different. Wait, but as per the question, it's divided by sqrt(n).

Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement, and the answer is actually that it holds in probability, and the 2/3 is a distractor. But according to the reasoning, the answer should be yes, it does hold in probability. Because using Markov's inequality, the probability that any X_i exceeds ε√n is bounded by E[X_i^4]/(ε^4 n^2) multiplied by n, which is E[X_i^4]/(ε^4 n), which tends to zero. Therefore, the supremum tends to zero in probability.

Alternatively, maybe the user is referring to a different problem, like the expectation of the supremum. For example, sometimes people look at E[sup X_i / sqrt(n)] and then see if it tends to zero. But according to the problem, it's about convergence in probability, not expectation.

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. For example, using the law of the iterated logarithm? The law of the iterated logarithm states that for i.i.d. variables with finite variance, the lim sup of X_n / sqrt(2n log log n) is 1 almost surely. But here, we are dealing with the supremum over n terms, so maybe similar ideas apply. Wait, but in our case, the supremum is over n terms, each scaled by 1/sqrt(n). Hmm.

Alternatively, consider that if the variables have a finite fourth moment, then their tails decay sufficiently fast. So, the probability that X_i is larger than some value decays at least as fast as 1/x^4. Therefore, P(X_i > t) ≤ C / t^4 for some constant C. Then, P(M_n > t) ≤ n * C / t^4. If we set t = ε sqrt(n), then P(M_n > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ n * C / (ε^4 n^2) ) = C / (ε^4 n). Which again tends to zero as n → ∞. So, same conclusion.

Wait, then why does the answer say 2/3? Maybe the original problem was different. Maybe the variables are not normalized by sqrt(n) but by something else. For example, if it were normalized by n^{1/4}, then perhaps the limit is different. Let me check.

Suppose instead we had X_i / n^{1/4}. Then, the supremum would be M_n / n^{1/4}. If we analyze P(M_n / n^{1/4} > ε) = P(M_n > ε n^{1/4}). Then, using the same approach, P(M_n > ε n^{1/4}) ≤ n * P(X_i > ε n^{1/4}) ≤ n * E[X_i^4] / (ε^4 n) ) = E[X_i^4] / ε^4. Which is a constant, not tending to zero. So, in that case, the supremum would not tend to zero in probability. But in our problem, it's divided by sqrt(n), so the scaling is different.

Alternatively, maybe the user is confused between almost sure convergence and convergence in probability. But in this case, since the upper bound tends to zero, convergence in probability holds. So, unless there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait another thought: maybe the variables are not positive, but they are positive. So, the maximum is straightforward. Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the exponent. For example, if the variables have higher moments, like E[X_i^k] < ∞ for some k, then the tail decays as 1/x^k. So, if k is larger, the tail decays faster. So, with E[X_i^4] < ∞, the tail is at least 1/x^4. So, even if the tail decays faster, the bound using Markov's inequality still holds. So, regardless, the probability P(X_i > t) ≤ C / t^4 for some C. Therefore, the upper bound on P(M_n > ε sqrt(n)) is n * C / (ε^4 n^2) ) = C / (ε^4 n) → 0.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, it does hold in probability. So, perhaps the 2/3 is a red herring, or maybe the original problem had a different exponent. Alternatively, maybe the user is confused and the answer is 2/3 for another part. For example, maybe in the problem statement, the question is about the expectation, and the answer is 2/3, but in the given problem, it's about convergence in probability. However, according to the reasoning, the answer is yes, it holds in probability.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider the expectation of the supremum. If E[sup X_i / sqrt(n)] → 0, then by Markov's inequality, convergence in probability holds. But even if the expectation doesn't go to zero, the supremum can still go to zero in probability. However, let's compute E[sup X_i / sqrt(n)].

But since the X_i are i.i.d., the expectation of the maximum can be tricky. However, we can use the fact that for non-negative random variables, E[M_n] = ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > t) dt. Let's compute E[M_n / sqrt(n)] = (1/sqrt(n)) ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > t) dt. Then, substituting t = ε sqrt(n), we have E[M_n / sqrt(n)] = ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > ε sqrt(n)) ε dε. Wait, maybe not straightforward.

Alternatively, let's consider E[M_n] = ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > t) dt. Then, E[M_n / sqrt(n)] = (1/sqrt(n)) ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > t) dt. Let's substitute t = s sqrt(n), so dt = sqrt(n) ds. Then, E[M_n / sqrt(n)] = ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ds. Now, we need to analyze P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) = 1 - P(X₁ ≤ s sqrt(n))^n.

Again, using the tail bound P(X_i > s sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n²). Therefore, P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ≤ n * E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n²) = E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n). Therefore, E[M_n / sqrt(n)] ≤ ∫₀^∞ E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n) ds = E[X_i^4]/n ∫₀^∞ 1/s^4 ds. But ∫₀^∞ 1/s^4 ds diverges. Hmm, so this approach might not work.

Alternatively, maybe split the integral into two parts: from 0 to 1 and from 1 to ∞. For s ≥ 1, P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n). So, the integral from 1 to ∞ is ≤ E[X_i^4]/n ∫₁^∞ 1/s^4 ds = E[X_i^4]/n * [1/3]. For s ≤ 1, P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ≤ 1, but s is small, so the integral from 0 to 1 is ≤ ∫₀¹ 1 ds = 1. Therefore, E[M_n / sqrt(n)] ≤ (E[X_i^4]/(3n)) + (1/sqrt(n)). Wait, no, hold on. Wait, the substitution gave us E[M_n / sqrt(n)] = ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ds. For s ≤ 1, the term s sqrt(n) ≤ sqrt(n). But since X_i are positive, P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ≤ 1. So, the integral from 0 to 1 is ≤ ∫₀¹ 1 ds = 1. For s ≥ 1, we have P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n). Therefore, the integral from 1 to ∞ is ≤ E[X_i^4]/n ∫₁^∞ 1/s^4 ds = E[X_i^4]/n * (1/3). Therefore, E[M_n / sqrt(n)] ≤ 1 + E[X_i^4]/(3n). As n → ∞, this tends to 1. So, the expectation tends to 1? Wait, that can't be. Wait, that seems contradictory to the previous result where the probability tends to zero.

Wait, but if the expectation tends to 1, that doesn't necessarily contradict the probability going to zero. Because even if the expectation is 1, the probability could still be going to zero. For example, if there's a concentration around 1, but the tail probability is small. Wait, but actually, if E[M_n / sqrt(n)] → 1, that suggests that the supremum is concentrating around 1, which would be inconsistent with the supremum tending to zero in probability. So, there must be an error in the calculation.

Wait, let's re-examine the substitution. Let me write it again:

E[M_n / sqrt(n)] = (1/sqrt(n)) E[M_n] = (1/sqrt(n)) ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > t) dt.

Let me substitute t = s sqrt(n), so dt = sqrt(n) ds. Therefore,

E[M_n / sqrt(n)] = (1/sqrt(n)) ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) sqrt(n) ds = ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ds.

So, that's correct. Then, for s ≥ 1, P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n). Therefore, the integral from 1 to ∞ is ≤ E[X_i^4]/n ∫₁^∞ 1/s^4 ds = E[X_i^4]/(3n). For s ≤ 1, P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ≤ 1. So, the integral from 0 to 1 is ≤ ∫₀¹ 1 ds = 1. Therefore, total E[M_n / sqrt(n)] ≤ 1 + E[X_i^4]/(3n). So, as n → ∞, this expectation tends to 1. But this contradicts the earlier conclusion that P(M_n / sqrt(n) > ε) → 0 for any ε > 0. How is this possible?

Wait, because if the expectation tends to 1, but the probability that M_n / sqrt(n) > ε tends to zero for any ε > 0, then the expectation is actually determined by the integral from 0 to 1, which is up to 1. But if the tail probabilities are small, then the expectation is concentrated near 0. Wait, this seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the substitution step. Let me check again. If we set t = s sqrt(n), then s = t / sqrt(n), and ds = dt / sqrt(n). Therefore, the substitution is:

E[M_n / sqrt(n)] = ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > t) dt / sqrt(n) = ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) (sqrt(n) ds) ) / sqrt(n) = ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ds.

Yes, that's correct. So, the expectation is indeed ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ds. Then, splitting the integral into two parts, for s ≤ 1 and s ≥ 1, gives us the upper bound of 1 + E[X_i^4]/(3n). But if the expectation is approaching 1, that would suggest that the supremum is approaching 1, but this conflicts with the previous conclusion that the probability of exceeding any ε > 0 tends to zero.

Wait, perhaps the error is in assuming that P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n) for s ≥ 1. Let me verify that. By Markov's inequality, P(X_i > t) ≤ E[X_i^4]/t^4. Therefore, P(M_n > t) ≤ n * E[X_i^4]/t^4. So, for t = s sqrt(n), P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ≤ n * E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n²) = E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n). This is correct. Therefore, the integral from 1 to ∞ is indeed bounded by E[X_i^4]/(3n). So, the expectation is bounded by 1 + E[X_i^4]/(3n), which tends to 1 as n → ∞. But this seems contradictory.

Wait, but if the expectation tends to 1, then the supremum is not going to zero. But according to the previous analysis, the probability that M_n / sqrt(n) exceeds ε tends to zero for any ε > 0. So, how can the expectation be approaching 1? That must mean that there's a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, let's take a concrete example. Suppose X_i are all equal to 1 with probability 1. Then, E[X_i^4] = 1 < ∞. Then, M_n = 1 for all n, so M_n / sqrt(n) = 1 / sqrt(n) → 0. In this case, the expectation E[M_n / sqrt(n)] = 1 / sqrt(n) → 0. But according to the previous upper bound, E[M_n / sqrt(n)] ≤ 1 + E[X_i^4]/(3n) = 1 + 1/(3n) → 1. Which is not matching the reality. Therefore, the upper bound is not tight.

Therefore, the previous approach of bounding P(M_n > s sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_i^4]/(s^4 n) is a very loose bound, especially when s is small. Therefore, splitting the integral into two parts is not helpful because the bound for s ≤ 1 is too loose.

Alternatively, maybe using a different approach. Let's consider that if we want to show that sup X_i / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability, it's equivalent to showing that for any ε > 0, P(∃ i ≤ n: X_i > ε sqrt(n)) → 0 as n → ∞.

Using the union bound, P(∃ i ≤ n: X_i > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ n * P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)).

So, we need to check if n * P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)) → 0 as n → ∞.

Given that E[X_1^4] < ∞, we can use Markov's inequality: P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n²).

Therefore, n * P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ n * E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n²) ) = E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n) → 0 as n → ∞.

Therefore, the union bound gives us that P(sup X_i / sqrt(n) > ε) ≤ E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n) → 0. Hence, the supremum does tend to zero in probability.

But in this case, even though the expectation of the supremum is 1, as per the previous wrong calculation, it must actually tend to zero. Wait, but in the example where all X_i are 1, the expectation is 1 / sqrt(n) → 0. So, perhaps my previous calculation was incorrect. Let's re-examine the expectation.

In the case where X_i are all 1, then M_n / sqrt(n) = 1 / sqrt(n), so the expectation is 1 / sqrt(n) → 0. But according to the substitution method, we had E[M_n / sqrt(n)] = ∫₀^∞ P(M_n > t) dt / sqrt(n). In this case, P(M_n > t) = 0 for t > 1, and 1 for t ≤ 1. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^1 1 dt + ∫₁^∞ 0 dt = 1. Then, divided by sqrt(n), gives 1 / sqrt(n). But according to the previous upper bound, we had E[M_n / sqrt(n)] ≤ 1 + E[X_i^4]/(3n). For X_i = 1, E[X_i^4] = 1, so the upper bound is 1 + 1/(3n), which is not matching the actual value of 1 / sqrt(n). Therefore, the upper bound is not tight.

Therefore, the mistake in the previous approach was that the bound for s ≤ 1 was too loose. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the union bound as above, which gives the correct result.

Therefore, returning to the original problem, since we can bound the probability using the union bound and Markov's inequality, and show that it tends to zero, the answer is yes, the supremum does tend to zero in probability.

So, the answer should be yes, and the 2/3 might be a mistake or from a different problem. But according to the detailed analysis, the conclusion is that it does hold in probability.

","Okay, let's see. I need to determine whether the supremum of X_i divided by sqrt(n) converges to zero in probability. The random variables are i.i.d., positive, and have finite fourth moments. Hmm. So, the question is about the behavior of the maximum of these variables scaled by 1/sqrt(n). 

First, I remember that when dealing with suprema of random variables, especially the maximum, we often look at tail probabilities. So, maybe I can use Markov's inequality or something related to exponential tails for the maximum. Since the X_i are i.i.d., the maximum M_n = max{X_1, ..., X_n} has a distribution that can be analyzed by considering the probability that all X_i are less than some value.

Let me write down the probability we're interested in: P( sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) > epsilon ) = P( max{X_1, ..., X_n} > epsilon sqrt(n) ). For this to converge to zero in probability, we need that for any epsilon > 0, the probability that the maximum exceeds epsilon sqrt(n) tends to zero as n goes to infinity.

So, using the tail probability, this is equal to 1 - [P(X_1 <= epsilon sqrt(n))]^n. Therefore, we need that [P(X_1 <= epsilon sqrt(n))]^n tends to 1, which would mean that P(X_1 > epsilon sqrt(n)) tends to zero exponentially fast? Wait, maybe not exactly exponentially, but at least faster than 1/n.

Alternatively, maybe we can bound P(X_1 > epsilon sqrt(n)) using Markov's inequality. Since X_i have finite fourth moments, we can apply Markov's inequality to X_1^4. Let's see. For any a > 0, P(X_1 > a) <= E[X_1^4]/a^4. So, if we set a = epsilon sqrt(n), then P(X_1 > epsilon sqrt(n)) <= E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2). Therefore, the tail probability decays like 1/n^2. Then, the probability that the maximum exceeds epsilon sqrt(n) is at most n * P(X_1 > epsilon sqrt(n)) <= n * E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2) ) = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n). So, this tends to zero as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the probability that the supremum exceeds epsilon sqrt(n) tends to zero, which would imply that the supremum converges to zero in probability.

Wait, but hold on. The maximum is over n variables, so the union bound gives us that P(max X_i > epsilon sqrt(n)) <= n * P(X_1 > epsilon sqrt(n)). Then, using the bound from Markov's inequality, we get that this probability is bounded by n * E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2) ) = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n). So, as n goes to infinity, this goes to zero. Therefore, for any epsilon > 0, the probability that the supremum is greater than epsilon goes to zero. Hence, the supremum converges to zero in probability.

But wait, is that correct? Let me check again. The key step here is applying the union bound (Boole's inequality), which says that the probability that at least one of the events happens is less than or equal to the sum of the probabilities. So, yes, P(max X_i > epsilon sqrt(n)) <= sum_{i=1}^n P(X_i > epsilon sqrt(n)) = n * P(X_1 > epsilon sqrt(n)), since they are i.i.d. Then, using Markov's inequality on the fourth moment, we get that P(X_1 > epsilon sqrt(n)) <= E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2). Therefore, multiplying by n gives E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n). Since E[X_1^4] is a constant, this expression tends to zero as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the upper bound on the probability tends to zero, which implies the desired convergence.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the supremum converges to zero in probability. But wait, let me think if there's another approach. Maybe using the expectation of the maximum? But the expectation might not be the right approach here because we are dealing with convergence in probability, not convergence in expectation. Alternatively, using the Borel-Cantelli lemma? If the sum of P(X_i > epsilon sqrt(n)) over i=1 to n is finite, then the events X_i > epsilon sqrt(n) occur finitely often almost surely. But the sum here is n * P(X_i > epsilon sqrt(n)) which, using the bound from Markov's inequality, is n * E[X_i^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2) ) = E[X_i^4]/(epsilon^4 n), which is summable over n? Wait, the sum from n=1 to infinity of 1/n is divergent, but here the sum is sum_{n=1}^\\infty [E[X_i^4]/(epsilon^4 n)]. Wait, but in the problem, we fix n and consider the supremum over i=1,...,n. So, for each n, we have the event that the maximum over i=1,...,n exceeds epsilon sqrt(n). Then, the union bound gives the probability for each n as n * P(X_i > epsilon sqrt(n)) which is O(1/n) as we saw. Then, summing over n gives sum_{n=1}^\\infty O(1/n) which diverges. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, since the sum is infinite, the events occur infinitely often almost surely? Wait, but that would suggest that the probability that the supremum exceeds epsilon sqrt(n) infinitely often is 1, which contradicts our previous result. Wait, maybe I need to be careful here.

Wait, Borel-Cantelli says that if the sum of the probabilities converges, then the probability of infinitely many events is zero; if it diverges, then the probability is one. But here, for each n, the event is ""there exists an i <= n such that X_i > epsilon sqrt(n)"". So, the events are not independent across n. Wait, actually, the events for different n are not the same. The event for n is about the first n variables, while for n+1 it includes the first n+1 variables. So, the sequence of events is not independent. Therefore, Borel-Cantelli may not apply here directly. So maybe my previous approach is better.

Alternatively, perhaps using the law of large numbers? If the variables are scaled by 1/sqrt(n), maybe something related to the central limit theorem? But the maximum is a different quantity. The CLT tells us about the average, not the maximum. So, perhaps not directly applicable.

Alternatively, since the variables have finite fourth moments, their tails are decaying at least as 1/x^4. So, the tail probability P(X_1 > x) decays like 1/x^4. Therefore, for x = epsilon sqrt(n), the tail probability decays like 1/(epsilon^4 n^2). Therefore, the union bound gives n * 1/(epsilon^4 n^2) = 1/(epsilon^4 n). So, the probability that the maximum exceeds epsilon sqrt(n) is O(1/n), which tends to zero. Therefore, the supremum converges to zero in probability. So, yes, the answer is yes.

Wait, but is there a case where even with finite fourth moment, the tail might decay slower? For example, if the distribution is such that P(X > x) decays like 1/x^3 for large x, then using Markov's inequality would give a bound of 1/x^3, but maybe the actual decay is faster. But since the fourth moment is finite, the tails must decay at least as 1/x^4. So, we can safely use Markov's inequality to bound the tail probability by 1/x^4. Therefore, the union bound gives us the required decay.

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, the supremum converges to zero in probability. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if the supremum of X_i divided by sqrt(n) tends to 0 in probability as n approaches infinity. The variables X_i are independent and identically distributed, positive, and have finite fourth moments. Hmm, let's start by recalling what ""in probability"" convergence means. It means that for any epsilon > 0, the probability that the supremum is greater than epsilon goes to 0 as n goes to infinity. 

First, let's denote M_n = sup{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n}. Then we need to check if M_n / sqrt(n) tends to 0 in probability. So, equivalently, we need to show that for any epsilon > 0, P(M_n / sqrt(n) > epsilon) → 0 as n → ∞. 

To analyze this, maybe I should look into the tail probabilities of M_n. Since the X_i are i.i.d., the distribution of M_n can be expressed as P(M_n ≤ x) = [P(X_1 ≤ x)]^n. Therefore, P(M_n > x) = 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ x)]^n. 

So, substituting x = epsilon * sqrt(n), we get P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) = 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n. We need this probability to go to 0 as n becomes large. 

Let me take the logarithm to handle the exponent. Let’s compute the logarithm of [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n, which is n * ln[P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]. If I can show that this term goes to -infinity, then the original expression 1 - [P(...)]^n would approach 0. 

So, n * ln[P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]. Let's denote x_n = epsilon * sqrt(n). Then, we need to evaluate n * ln[P(X_1 ≤ x_n)]. 

Since X_1 has a finite fourth moment, it's in L^4, which means it has a finite mean and variance, and higher moments. But how does the tail probability behave? For heavy-tailed distributions, the tail might decay polynomially, but here since the fourth moment is finite, the tails should decay at least as fast as polynomially. However, even with polynomial decay, if the decay is not exponential, the tail probabilities might not be negligible for large n. 

Wait, but maybe I can use Markov's inequality here. Since X_i are positive, E[X_i^4] < ∞, so E[X_i^4] = E[X_i^4 * I(X_i ≤ x_n) + X_i^4 * I(X_i > x_n)]. The first term is ≤ x_n^4, and the second term is ≤ E[X_i^4]. But I'm not sure if that directly helps. 

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that for any x > 0, P(X_1 > x) ≤ E[X_1^4]/x^4 by Markov's inequality. So, P(X_1 ≤ x) ≥ 1 - E[X_1^4]/x^4. Then, P(M_n > x) ≤ 1 - [1 - E[X_1^4]/x^4]^n. 

But here, x = epsilon * sqrt(n), so substituting, we get P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≤ 1 - [1 - E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2)]^n. 

Then, using the approximation that for small t, (1 - t)^n ≈ e^{-n t}, as long as n t is not too large. So, if n * E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2) = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n) → 0 as n → ∞. Therefore, [1 - E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2)]^n ≈ e^{- E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n)}. So, the probability becomes approximately 1 - e^{- E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n)}. 

Then, as n → ∞, this expression tends to 1 - e^0 = 1 - 1 = 0. Wait, but that seems contradictory. If that's the case, then P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) → 0, which would mean that M_n / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability. But that can't be right because even if the tails decay polynomially, the maximum over n terms could still be large. 

Wait, but perhaps my approximation is missing something. Let me check again. If x_n = epsilon * sqrt(n), then P(X_1 > x_n) ≤ E[X_1^4]/x_n^4 = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2). Therefore, the tail probability decays as 1/n^2. Then, the probability that any of the X_i exceeds x_n is at most n * E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2) = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n). Therefore, by union bound, P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n). Since E[X_1^4] is a constant, this probability decays as 1/n, which goes to 0 as n → ∞. 

Wait, that seems different from my previous approximation. So, perhaps using the union bound directly is a better approach here. Since the X_i are independent, the probability that at least one X_i exceeds epsilon * sqrt(n) is at most n * P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)) by the union bound. Then, using Markov's inequality, P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4]/(epsilon * sqrt(n))^4 = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2). Therefore, the union bound gives P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≤ n * E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2) = E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n). 

Therefore, as n → ∞, this bound tends to 0. Hence, for any epsilon > 0, the probability that the supremum exceeds epsilon * sqrt(n) tends to 0. Therefore, sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability. 

But wait, is this correct? Let me think again. Suppose the X_i are normal variables. Then, their tails decay exponentially, so the probability that any X_i is greater than epsilon * sqrt(n) would be roughly n * P(X_1 > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≈ n * e^{-epsilon^2 n / 2}, which is tiny, so the union bound would give a very small probability. But even for heavier tails, like with polynomial decay, say X_i has tail probability P(X_i > x) ≈ 1/x^p for some p > 0. Then, P(X_i > epsilon sqrt(n)) ≈ 1/(epsilon^p n^{p/2}), so the union bound would give n * 1/(epsilon^p n^{p/2}) = 1/(epsilon^p n^{p/2 - 1}). 

For this to go to 0, we need p/2 - 1 > 0, which is p > 2. But since X_i has finite fourth moment, does that imply that p ≥ 4? Because for a random variable with finite fourth moment, the tail probability decays at least as fast as 1/x^4. Therefore, p ≥ 4. So, if p > 2, then the union bound term decays as 1/n^{p/2 - 1}. Since p ≥ 4, p/2 - 1 ≥ 1, so the term decays at least as 1/n. Therefore, in all cases where the tail decays polynomially with p ≥ 4, the union bound gives a term that decays at least as 1/n, which tends to 0. 

Therefore, regardless of the specific distribution (as long as the fourth moment is finite), the union bound gives a sufficient condition. Therefore, the supremum divided by sqrt(n) does tend to 0 in probability. 

But let me check with a concrete example. Suppose X_i is a standard normal variable. Then, E[X_i^4] = 3, which is finite. Then, the supremum divided by sqrt(n) is the maximum of n standard normals divided by sqrt(n). The maximum of n standard normals is known to be approximately 2 sqrt(log n) for large n. So, 2 sqrt(log n) / sqrt(n) tends to 0 as n → ∞. Therefore, this example is consistent with the conclusion. 

Another example: suppose X_i is a Pareto distribution with tail parameter alpha > 4. Then, E[X_i^4] is finite (since alpha > 4). The tail probability P(X_i > x) ≈ 1/x^alpha. Then, P(X_i > epsilon sqrt(n)) ≈ 1/(epsilon^alpha n^{alpha/2}). Then, the union bound gives n * 1/(epsilon^alpha n^{alpha/2}) = 1/(epsilon^alpha n^{alpha/2 - 1}). Since alpha > 4, alpha/2 - 1 > 1, so the probability decays as 1/n^{alpha/2 - 1}, which tends to 0. 

Therefore, even for heavy-tailed distributions (as long as they have finite fourth moment), the union bound argument works. 

Alternatively, if the fourth moment is not finite, then the tail decay is slower, say polynomial with alpha ≤ 4, then the union bound might not decay to 0. For example, if alpha = 4, then the tail decay is 1/x^4, so P(X_i > x) ≈ 1/x^4. Then, P(X_i > epsilon sqrt(n)) ≈ 1/(epsilon^4 n^2), so the union bound gives n * 1/(epsilon^4 n^2) = 1/(epsilon^4 n), which still tends to 0. Wait, but if alpha = 4, then the fourth moment is finite (since integral x^4 * 1/x^5 dx from x=1 to infinity is finite). So even alpha=4 is okay. But if alpha < 4, then the fourth moment is infinite. So, in our problem, since the fourth moment is finite, alpha ≥ 4, so the union bound gives decay at least 1/n. 

Therefore, regardless, under the given conditions, the supremum divided by sqrt(n) tends to 0 in probability. 

But just to be thorough, let's consider the case where X_i has a finite fourth moment but maybe some higher moments are infinite. Wait, but the problem only states that the fourth moment is finite. So, even if higher moments are infinite, the fourth moment is enough for the tail bounds via Markov's inequality. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the Borel-Cantelli lemma. For the event that X_i > epsilon * sqrt(n) to happen infinitely often, the sum over n of P(X_i > epsilon * sqrt(n)) must diverge. However, in our case, we have P(X_i > epsilon * sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_i^4]/(epsilon * sqrt(n))^4 = E[X_i^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2). The sum over n of 1/n^2 converges, so by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that X_i > epsilon * sqrt(n) infinitely often is 0. Therefore, almost surely, only finitely many X_i exceed epsilon * sqrt(n). Hence, for large n, the maximum X_i / sqrt(n) will be less than epsilon. 

Therefore, combining both the union bound and Borel-Cantelli arguments, we can conclude that sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) → 0 in probability. 

Wait, but Borel-Cantelli tells us that the events X_i > epsilon * sqrt(n) occur finitely often almost surely, which is a stronger statement than convergence in probability. Convergence in probability is a weaker condition, so if almost sure convergence holds, then convergence in probability automatically holds. 

Therefore, in this case, since the events X_i > epsilon * sqrt(n) happen only finitely often almost surely, then for any epsilon > 0, there exists a random N such that for all n ≥ N, X_i / sqrt(n) ≤ epsilon for all i. Therefore, the supremum is ≤ epsilon, which implies that the supremum converges to 0 almost surely, hence in probability. 

But even if the convergence is only in probability, the union bound and Markov's inequality are sufficient. 

So, putting it all together, the answer is yes, the supremum does tend to 0 in probability.

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether the supremum of X_i divided by sqrt(n) tends to zero in probability as n goes to infinity. The variables are i.i.d., positive, and have finite fourth moments. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, the supremum here is the maximum value of X_i / sqrt(n) for i from 1 to n. So, if I denote M_n = max{X_1, X_2, ..., X_n}, then the expression in question is M_n / sqrt(n). The question is whether this ratio converges to zero in probability.

To check convergence in probability, I need to show that for any epsilon > 0, the probability that M_n / sqrt(n) is greater than epsilon tends to zero as n increases. That is, P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) → 0 as n → ∞.

So, my task reduces to analyzing the tail probability P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)). Since the variables are i.i.d., the probability that all X_i are less than or equal to epsilon * sqrt(n) is [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n. Therefore, the complementary probability is 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n. So, P(M_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) = 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ epsilon * sqrt(n))]^n.

Our goal is to show that this probability tends to zero as n grows. Let me denote epsilon as a fixed positive constant. Let's denote t_n = epsilon * sqrt(n). Then, P(M_n > t_n) = 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ t_n)]^n.

To evaluate this limit, I need to understand the behavior of P(X_1 > t_n) and how it scales with n. Since X_1 has finite fourth moments, we know that E[X_1^4] < infinity. This might be useful for bounding the tail probability.

I recall that for tail probabilities, Markov's inequality can be used. Markov's inequality states that for a non-negative random variable Y and a > 0, P(Y > a) ≤ E[Y^k] / a^k for any k > 0. Let's apply this here. Let Y = X_1, and let's choose k=4. Then, P(X_1 > t_n) ≤ E[X_1^4] / t_n^4. So, P(X_1 > t_n) ≤ C / t_n^4, where C = E[X_1^4].

But t_n = epsilon * sqrt(n), so t_n^4 = epsilon^4 * n^2. Therefore, P(X_1 > t_n) ≤ C / (epsilon^4 n^2). That gives us a bound on the tail probability.

Now, going back to P(M_n > t_n) = 1 - [P(X_1 ≤ t_n)]^n. Let's write this as 1 - [1 - P(X_1 > t_n)]^n. Using the bound from Markov's inequality, we can approximate [1 - P(X_1 > t_n)]^n ≈ [1 - C/(epsilon^4 n^2)]^n. 

But for large n, [1 - C/(epsilon^4 n^2)]^n can be approximated using the exponential function. Recall that (1 - a/n)^n ≈ e^{-a} as n → ∞. However, here we have (1 - C/(epsilon^4 n^2))^n. Let me see: if I denote a_n = C/(epsilon^4 n^2), then the expression becomes (1 - a_n)^n ≈ e^{-n a_n} = e^{-C/(epsilon^4 n)}. 

So, as n tends to infinity, the exponent -C/(epsilon^4 n) tends to zero, so e^{-C/(epsilon^4 n)} ≈ 1 - C/(epsilon^4 n). Therefore, [1 - C/(epsilon^4 n^2)]^n ≈ 1 - C/(epsilon^4 n). Therefore, P(M_n > t_n) ≈ 1 - [1 - C/(epsilon^4 n)] = C/(epsilon^4 n).

But wait, this suggests that P(M_n > t_n) is approximately C/(epsilon^4 n), which tends to zero as n → ∞. Therefore, the probability that M_n / sqrt(n) exceeds epsilon tends to zero, which would imply that M_n / sqrt(n) converges to zero in probability.

But wait, hold on. Let me check this again. Let's make sure I didn't make a mistake in the approximation. Let's take the logarithm of [1 - P(X_1 > t_n)]^n. The logarithm is n * log(1 - P(X_1 > t_n)). Using the approximation log(1 - x) ≈ -x for small x, we get approximately -n * P(X_1 > t_n). Since P(X_1 > t_n) ≈ C/(epsilon^4 n^2), then the logarithm is approximately -n * C/(epsilon^4 n^2) = -C/(epsilon^4 n). Exponentiating this gives e^{-C/(epsilon^4 n)}. Therefore, [1 - P(X_1 > t_n)]^n ≈ e^{-C/(epsilon^4 n)}. Therefore, P(M_n > t_n) = 1 - e^{-C/(epsilon^4 n)}.

But as n → ∞, the exponent -C/(epsilon^4 n) approaches zero, so e^{-C/(epsilon^4 n)} ≈ 1 - C/(epsilon^4 n). Therefore, P(M_n > t_n) ≈ 1 - (1 - C/(epsilon^4 n)) = C/(epsilon^4 n). Therefore, P(M_n > t_n) ~ C/(epsilon^4 n), which indeed tends to zero as n → ∞. Therefore, the probability that M_n / sqrt(n) > epsilon tends to zero, which is what we wanted to show.

But wait, another thought: the bound from Markov's inequality is quite loose. Maybe there's a better way to estimate the tail probability? Since X_1 has finite fourth moments, perhaps we can use a more precise estimate for the tail. For example, using the tail probability decay for variables with finite moments.

For a random variable with finite fourth moment, the tail probability P(X > x) decays at least as fast as x^{-4}. In fact, by Markov's inequality, we have that P(X > x) ≤ E[X^4]/x^4. So, even if we use Markov's inequality, we get that the tail is O(x^{-4}).

But perhaps we can use a better approximation, like using the fact that for large x, the tail probability is dominated by the highest moment. However, since we only know that the fourth moment is finite, the tail could still be as slow as x^{-4}.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Borel-Cantelli lemma. If we can show that the sum over n of P(X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) is finite, then by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n) infinitely often is zero. But in this case, the sum over n of P(X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) is sum over n of E[X_1^4]/(epsilon^4 n^2) = E[X_1^4]/epsilon^4 * sum 1/n^2, which is finite. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, P(X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n) infinitely often) = 0. Therefore, almost surely, only finitely many X_n exceed epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, for sufficiently large n, M_n <= epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, M_n / sqrt(n) <= epsilon, which would imply that M_n / sqrt(n) converges to zero in probability.

Wait, but actually, the Borel-Cantelli lemma here would directly give that almost surely, only finitely many X_n exceed epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, for all sufficiently large n, M_n <= epsilon * sqrt(n). But since epsilon is arbitrary, this would imply that M_n / sqrt(n) tends to zero almost surely, which is a stronger statement than convergence in probability. Therefore, this would imply that the supremum indeed tends to zero in probability.

But wait, let's verify this. If almost surely, only finitely many X_n exceed epsilon * sqrt(n), then for any epsilon > 0, there exists an N such that for all n > N, X_n <= epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, the maximum of X_1, ..., X_n for n > N is <= epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, M_n / sqrt(n) <= epsilon for n > N. Therefore, lim sup_{n} M_n / sqrt(n) <= epsilon almost surely. Since this holds for any epsilon > 0, we can conclude that lim_{n} M_n / sqrt(n) = 0 almost surely. Therefore, convergence in probability follows from almost sure convergence.

But the problem only asks for convergence in probability, so even if we can establish almost sure convergence, that would be sufficient. However, the question is whether the supremum tends to zero in probability. The supremum over i=1,...,n of X_i / sqrt(n). So, in other words, the maximum value among X_1/sqrt(n), ..., X_n/sqrt(n). So, if we can show that for any epsilon > 0, the probability that at least one X_i / sqrt(n) > epsilon tends to zero as n → ∞, then we are done.

By Borel-Cantelli, since sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n)) <= sum_{n=1}^\\infty E[X_n^4]/(epsilon * sqrt(n))^4 = E[X_1^4]/epsilon^4 * sum_{n=1}^\\infty 1/n^2, which is finite. Therefore, by Borel-Cantelli, the probability that X_n > epsilon * sqrt(n) occurs infinitely often is zero. Therefore, almost surely, only finitely many X_n exceed epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, for sufficiently large n, all X_n <= epsilon * sqrt(n), so the maximum M_n <= epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, M_n / sqrt(n) <= epsilon, which implies that the limit superior is <= epsilon. Since this holds for any epsilon > 0, the limit superior is zero almost surely, hence convergence in probability holds.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the supremum tends to zero in probability.

Wait, but let me check if there's a case where even though the Borel-Cantelli applies, the supremum might still have issues. For example, suppose that for each n, there's a 1/n chance that X_n exceeds epsilon * sqrt(n), but the sum over n 1/n diverges. Then, Borel-Cantelli would say that infinitely many exceedances occur almost surely. However, in our case, the sum converges, so only finitely many exceedances. Therefore, the maximum would be finite, so for large n, the maximum is controlled by epsilon * sqrt(n). Therefore, the supremum over 1,...,n is controlled by the maximum up to n, which is <= epsilon * sqrt(n) for sufficiently large n. Therefore, the supremum divided by sqrt(n) is <= epsilon, so the supremum tends to zero.

Alternatively, even if we don't use Borel-Cantelli, using the tail estimate from Markov's inequality and then approximating the probability, as I did earlier, we found that the probability decays as 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, both approaches lead to the conclusion that the probability tends to zero.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the supremum tends to zero in probability.

Given i.i.d. positive random variables \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots\\) with \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_i^4] < \\infty\\), we need to determine if \\(\\sup_{i=1, \\ldots, n} \\frac{X_i}{\\sqrt{n}} \\rightarrow 0\\) in probability.

To analyze this, we consider the maximum \\(M_n = \\max\\{X_1, \\ldots, X_n\\}\\). We need to check if \\(P\\left(\\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}} > \\epsilon\\right) \\rightarrow 0\\) for any \\(\\epsilon > 0\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).

Using the tail probability, we have:
\\[
P\\left(M_n > \\epsilon \\sqrt{n}\\right) = 1 - \\left(P(X_1 \\leq \\epsilon \\sqrt{n})\\right)^n
\\]

Let \\(p_n = P(X_1 > \\epsilon \\sqrt{n})\\). By Markov's inequality:
\\[
p_n \\leq \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4]}{(\\epsilon \\sqrt{n})^4} = \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4]}{\\epsilon^4 n^2}
\\]

Thus, \\(n p_n \\leq \\frac{\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4]}{\\epsilon^4 n}\\). Since \\(\\mathbb{E}[X_1^4] < \\infty\\), \\(n p_n \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\).

Approximating using logarithms:
\\[
\\left(P(X_1 \\leq \\epsilon \\sqrt{n})\\right)^n = \\left(1 - p_n\\right)^n \\approx e^{-n p_n}
\\]

As \\(n p_n \\rightarrow 0\\), we get:
\\[
P\\left(M_n > \\epsilon \\sqrt{n}\\right) \\approx 1 - e^{-n p_n} \\approx n p_n \\rightarrow 0
\\]

Additionally, by the Borel-Cantelli lemma, since \\(\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty P(X_n > \\epsilon \\sqrt{n}) < \\infty\\), almost surely only finitely many \\(X_n\\) exceed \\(\\epsilon \\sqrt{n}\\). Hence, for large \\(n\\), \\(\\frac{M_n}{\\sqrt{n}}\\) is dominated by terms tending to 0.

Thus, \\(\\sup_{i=1, \\ldots, n} \\frac{X_i}{\\sqrt{n}} \\rightarrow 0\\) in probability.

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether the supremum of X_i divided by sqrt(n) goes to zero in probability as n approaches infinity. The variables are i.i.d., positive, and have finite fourth moments. Hmm, let's start by recalling some probability concepts.

First, the supremum here is the maximum of X_i / sqrt(n). So, for each n, we take the maximum X_i from 1 to n, divide it by sqrt(n), and then check if this maximum tends to zero in probability. In other words, for any ε > 0, the probability that the maximum X_i / sqrt(n) exceeds ε should go to zero as n becomes large.

Since the variables are i.i.d., the maximum M_n = max{X_1, ..., X_n} has a certain distribution. I remember that for maxima, the tail probability can be analyzed using the union bound. That is, P(M_n > ε sqrt(n)) = P(max{X_i} > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ n P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)).

So, if I can show that n P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)) tends to zero as n approaches infinity, then by the union bound, the probability that the supremum exceeds ε goes to zero, which would imply the convergence in probability.

Given that E[X_i^4] < ∞, we can use Markov's inequality to bound P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)). Markov's inequality states that P(X_1 > a) ≤ E[X_1^k] / a^k for any k > 0. Let's choose k=4 here, so:

P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ E[X_1^4] / (ε sqrt(n))^4 = E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n^2).

Therefore, n P(X_1 > ε sqrt(n)) ≤ n * E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n^2) = E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n).

As n tends to infinity, this expression tends to zero. Therefore, the upper bound for the probability that the maximum exceeds ε sqrt(n) tends to zero. Hence, by the union bound, P(sup_{i=1,...,n} X_i / sqrt(n) > ε) ≤ E[X_1^4] / (ε^4 n) → 0.

Therefore, the supremum does go to zero in probability. Wait, but let me check if there's a different approach or if I missed something.

Alternatively, maybe using the law of large numbers? But the law of large numbers gives convergence of the average, which is different from the maximum. Another thought: since the variables are positive and have finite fourth moments, they are also in L^2, so maybe using Chebyshev's inequality for sums? But the problem is about the maximum, not the sum.

Wait, but the union bound approach seems straightforward here. Since each term is bounded by n times the tail probability, and the tail probability decays as 1/n^2, so multiplying by n gives 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, the probability that the maximum exceeds ε sqrt(n) is bounded by a term that goes to zero, hence the convergence in probability holds.

Is there a case where this might not hold? For example, if the tail decay is slower. But since we have finite fourth moments, the tail of X_i decays at least as fast as 1/x^4 for large x. So, P(X_i > x) ≤ E[X_i^4] / x^4 by Markov's inequality. Therefore, for x = ε sqrt(n), the tail probability is O(1/n^2), so n * O(1/n^2) = O(1/n) → 0. So yes, that seems to check out.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the supremum goes to zero in probability.

**Final Answer**
\\boxed{Yes}
