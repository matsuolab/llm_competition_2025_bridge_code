To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}
\\]

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

Additionally, we verified using integral comparison. The integral \\(\\int_{0}^{n} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{n^2}\\right) \\, dx\\) was evaluated and found to approach \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), confirming our result.

Thus, the limit is:

\\[
\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) as n approaches infinity. Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving sums, especially as n goes to infinity, Riemann sums often come into play. But before jumping to that, I should analyze the behavior of the terms inside the sum.

The function arcsin(x) is defined for x in [-1, 1], but in this case, since k goes from 1 to n and n is going to infinity, k/n² will be very small for large n. Because even when k is as large as n, the term is n/n² = 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So, each term inside the arcsin is a small positive number approaching 0. That might be useful because for small x, arcsin(x) can be approximated by its Taylor series expansion.

Let me recall the Taylor series for arcsin(x) around x=0. The expansion is x + x³/6 + (3x⁵)/40 + ... So, for very small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x. Therefore, maybe I can approximate each term in the sum as k/n², and then sum those up. Let's try that.

So, the sum becomes approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k/n². The sum of k from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2. Therefore, substituting that in, we get [n(n+1)/2] / n² = (n² + n)/2n² = (1 + 1/n)/2. As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the limit would be (1 + 0)/2 = 1/2. But wait, the problem mentions the answer is 2/3. Hmm, that contradicts my result. So maybe my approximation was too rough?

Let me check again. If arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 for small x, then perhaps considering the next term in the expansion might give a better approximation. Let's try that.

So, arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)³ / 6. Therefore, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)]. Let's compute each part separately.

First, sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = (1 + 1/n)/2, which tends to 1/2 as n approaches infinity.

Second, sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = (1/(6n⁶)) * sum_{k=1}^n k³. We know that sum_{k=1}^n k³ = [n(n+1)/2]^2. So substituting, we get (1/(6n⁶)) * [n²(n+1)²/4] = [n²(n² + 2n + 1)/4]/(6n⁶) = [n⁴ + 2n³ + n²]/24n⁶ = [1 + 2/n + 1/n²]/24n². As n approaches infinity, this term tends to 0 because of the 1/n² in the denominator. So adding the two parts together, the limit would still be 1/2. But the problem states the answer is 2/3. Hmm, so my approximation is missing something.

Wait, maybe higher-order terms are contributing more? Let me check the original expansion again. The Taylor series for arcsin(x) is x + x³/6 + (3x⁵)/40 + ... So maybe even the next term is necessary? Let's try including the x⁵ term.

So, arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)³ /6 + (3(k/n²)^5)/40. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶) + 3k⁵/(40n^{10})]. As before, the first term's sum tends to 1/2, the second term's sum tends to 0, and the third term's sum is even smaller, so negligible. So still, the limit would be 1/2. But the problem's answer is 2/3. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe my initial approach is wrong?

Alternatively, perhaps the problem requires a different method. Let me think. Maybe instead of approximating each term, I can consider the sum as a Riemann sum. Let's see. The sum is from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). If we let x = k/n², then as n approaches infinity, x ranges from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. Wait, but 1/n approaches 0. So the interval of x is from 0 to 0? That seems problematic. Maybe another substitution?

Wait, perhaps if I set x = k/n², then k = nx². Then, the sum can be approximated by an integral. Let's see. The sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). If we consider n as a large number, then k/n² is small, so x = k/n² is in the range [1/n², 1/n]. But integrating over x from 0 to 0 doesn't make sense. Maybe another approach?

Alternatively, maybe I should approximate the sum using an integral. Since the sum is over k from 1 to n, and each term is arcsin(k/n²). Let's make a substitution. Let t = k/n². Then, when k ranges from 1 to n, t ranges from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. But as n approaches infinity, t ranges from 0 to 0. Wait, that's not helpful. Maybe another substitution.

Alternatively, consider that k/n² = (k/n) * (1/n). So if we let x = k/n, then t = x*(1/n). Then, as n approaches infinity, x ranges from 0 to 1, and t ranges from 0 to 0. Hmm, maybe not helpful.

Wait, perhaps the problem can be transformed into an integral by considering the sum as a Riemann sum. Let's see. If we set x_k = k/n², then Δx = 1/n². But then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k) * Δx, which would approximate the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) dx. But as n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the integral becomes from 0 to 0, which is 0. But this contradicts the previous result. So that approach might not work.

Alternatively, maybe I need to adjust the substitution. Let's think again. The sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me set t = k/n². Then, as n approaches infinity, t ranges from 0 (when k=1, t=1/n²) to 1/n (when k=n, t=1/n). So the interval of t is [1/n², 1/n], which shrinks to 0. But the number of terms in the sum is n, which is going to infinity. So maybe this is a case where the sum can be approximated by an integral over an interval that's shrinking to 0 but with a large number of terms. Maybe using a substitution to convert the sum into an integral.

Let me try to model this. If we have a sum sum_{k=1}^n f(k/n²), and we want to approximate it as an integral. Let’s let x = k/n². Then, k = nx². The step between consecutive k's is Δk = 1, so Δx = Δk / (n²) = 1/n². The sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n f(x) * Δx^{-1}. Wait, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, if we set x = k/n², then when k increases by 1, x increases by 1/n². So the sum is sum_{x=1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(x) / (1/n²). Because each term is arcsin(x) and the width Δx is 1/n², so the sum is approximately the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx divided by (1/n²). Wait, maybe not exactly, but in the limit as n approaches infinity, the sum can be approximated by the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx multiplied by n².

So, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ n² * ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx.

Now, compute the integral ∫ arcsin(x) dx. Let's recall that the integral of arcsin(x) dx is x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/n:

[ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - (1/n)²) ] - [0 + sqrt(1 - 0²)] = (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - 1.

Now, as n approaches infinity, arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3 /6 + ... So (1/n) arcsin(1/n) ≈ (1/n)(1/n) = 1/n² + (1/n^4)/6 + ... Similarly, sqrt(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²) - 1/(8n⁴) - ... So putting it all together:

∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx ≈ [1/n² + ... ] + [1 - 1/(2n²) - ... ] - 1 = 1/n² + 1 - 1/(2n²) - 1 + ... = (1/n² - 1/(2n²)) + ... = 1/(2n²) + higher order terms.

Therefore, the integral is approximately 1/(2n²). Therefore, the sum is approximately n² * 1/(2n²) = 1/2. So again, the limit is 1/2. But the problem states that the answer is 2/3. This is confusing. There must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in approximating the integral. Let me check again. Let's compute the integral ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx.

Let me compute it exactly first. Let’s integrate by parts. Let u = arcsin(x), dv = dx. Then du = 1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, v = x. Therefore, the integral becomes uv|₀^{1/n} - ∫₀^{1/n} x/sqrt(1 - x²) dx.

Compute uv|₀^{1/n}: (1/n) arcsin(1/n) - 0.

Then, the integral ∫₀^{1/n} x/sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Let’s substitute t = 1 - x², then dt = -2x dx, so -dt/2 = x dx. The limits when x=0, t=1; x=1/n, t=1 - 1/n². Therefore, the integral becomes -1/2 ∫_{t=1}^{t=1 - 1/n²} 1/sqrt(t) dt = -1/2 [2 sqrt(t)]_{1}^{1 - 1/n²} = - [sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - sqrt(1)] = - [sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - 1].

Therefore, putting it all together:

∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx = (1/n) arcsin(1/n) - [ - (sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - 1) ] = (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - 1.

Now, expand each term as n approaches infinity:

arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3 /6 + (3 (1/n)^5)/40 + ...

sqrt(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²) - 1/(8n⁴) - ...

Therefore:

(1/n) arcsin(1/n) ≈ (1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³) + ...) = 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) + ...

sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ≈ -1/(2n²) - 1/(8n⁴) - ...

Adding these together:

1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) - 1/(2n²) - 1/(8n⁴) + ... = (1 - 1/2)/n² + (1/6 - 1/8)/n⁴ + ... = (1/2)/n² + (1/24)/n⁴ + ...

Therefore, ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx ≈ 1/(2n²) + 1/(24n⁴) + ... So multiplying by n² gives the sum approximation:

n² * [1/(2n²) + 1/(24n⁴) + ...] = 1/2 + 1/(24n²) + ... As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. So again, the limit is 1/2. But the problem states the answer is 2/3. There's a contradiction here. Did I misinterpret the problem?

Wait, let me check the original problem again. It says: Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). The user mentioned ""Return your fina Evaluate the limit: ... \\frac{2}{3}$"" which might be a formatting error, but the answer is supposed to be 2/3. But according to my calculations, it's 1/2. Where is the mistake?

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written differently. Wait, let me check again. The problem is as stated: sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Maybe I made a mistake in the approximation step.

Wait, another thought: Perhaps the sum can be approximated by an integral with a different substitution. Let me try again. Let’s set x = k/n. Then, k = xn, and since k goes from 1 to n, x goes from 1/n to 1. Then, the term k/n² becomes (xn)/n² = x/n. So arcsin(k/n²) = arcsin(x/n). Then, the sum becomes sum_{x=1/n}^1 arcsin(x/n), with x stepping by 1/n each time. So the sum is approximately the integral from x=0 to x=1 of arcsin(0) dx? Wait, no. Wait, if x is from 0 to 1, and each term is arcsin(x/n), then as n approaches infinity, x/n approaches 0 for all x in [0,1]. Therefore, arcsin(x/n) ≈ x/n. Then, the sum would be approximately the integral from 0 to 1 of (x/n) * dx. But since we are summing over x stepping by 1/n, the sum is approximately the integral from 0 to 1 of (x/n) dx * n. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the sum is sum_{x=0}^n arcsin(x/n²) but x here is k. Wait, maybe this substitution is not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe using the mean value theorem for sums. If the function is approximately linear near 0, then the sum can be approximated by the integral. Wait, but the previous methods gave 1/2, conflicting with the problem's answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me try to compute the sum numerically for large n and see if it approaches 1/2 or 2/3. Let's take n=1000. Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^{1000} arcsin(k/(1000)^2). Each term is arcsin(k/1,000,000). For large k, say k=1000, the term is arcsin(1000/1,000,000)=arcsin(0.001)≈0.001 + 0.001³/6≈0.001 + 0.0000001666≈0.0010001666. So summing all terms from k=1 to 1000, each term is approximately k/1,000,000. The sum would be approximately sum_{k=1}^{1000} k/1,000,000 = (1000*1001)/2 /1,000,000 ≈ (1,001,000)/2,000,000 ≈ 0.5005. So approximately 0.5005, which is close to 1/2. For larger n, say n=1,000,000, the sum would be approximately 1/2. So why does the problem say the answer is 2/3? Maybe the problem was miswritten?

Wait, let me check again. The original problem is: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Maybe there's a typo, and it should be arcsin(k/n²) instead of arcsin(k/n²). Wait, no, that's the same. Alternatively, maybe the limit is supposed to be 2/3, but my calculations are wrong. Let me think again.

Wait, another approach. Let's consider that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Then, sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6]. The first sum is n(n+1)/(2n²) ≈ 1/2 + 1/(2n). The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [n²(n+1)^2 /4]/(6n⁶) = (n²(n² + 2n +1)/4)/(6n⁶) = (n⁴ + 2n³ + n²)/(24n⁶) = (1 + 2/n + 1/n²)/(24n²) ≈ 1/(24n²) for large n. Therefore, the total sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²). As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. So again, 1/2.

But the problem says 2/3. Is there a different approximation for arcsin(x) for small x that I'm missing? Let me check the Taylor series again. The expansion is x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So up to x³, it's x + x³/6. If we take more terms, would that change the result? Let's try including the x⁵ term.

So, arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + (3(k/n²)^5)/40. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶) + 3k⁵/(40n^{10})]. As before, the first term sums to ~1/2, the second term sums to ~1/(24n²), the third term sums to ~3/(40n⁸) * sum k⁵. The sum of k⁵ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^5 / something? Wait, the exact formula is sum_{k=1}^n k^5 = [n²(n+1)²(2n² + 2n -1)]/12. But regardless, when divided by n^{10}, it becomes [n²(n² + ... )]/12n^{10} ≈ 1/(12n⁶). So the third term is ~3/(40n⁸) * O(n^6) = O(n^{-2}), which still tends to 0. So even adding more terms doesn't change the limit. Therefore, the limit is 1/2.

But the problem says 2/3. Maybe the problem is different. Wait, perhaps the limit is for sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) as n approaches infinity, and there's a different approach. Let me try integrating.

Alternatively, consider that the sum can be approximated by an integral using a substitution. Let me set t = k/n². Then, k = n²t, and dk = n² dt. But integrating from t=1/n² to t=1/n. Wait, but integrating over t from 0 to 0 as n approaches infinity. Hmm, not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe use the Euler-Maclaurin formula to approximate the sum. But that might be complicated.

Wait, another idea: For large n, the sum is approximating the integral of arcsin(x) from x=0 to x=1/n, but scaled by n². Wait, earlier I did that and got 1/2. But perhaps I need to consider more precise approximations.

Wait, earlier when I computed the integral ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx ≈ 1/(2n²), so multiplying by n² gives 1/2. But maybe there's a higher-order term that contributes? Let's see. The integral was approximated as 1/(2n²) + 1/(24n⁴) + ..., so multiplying by n² gives 1/2 + 1/(24n²) + ..., which tends to 1/2. So even with higher-order terms, the limit remains 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly. Maybe the limit is supposed to be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), which would be a different problem. Or perhaps the answer provided is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming arcsin(x) ≈ x. Let me check with specific numbers. For example, take x=0.1, arcsin(0.1)≈0.100167421. So the approximation arcsin(x)≈x+0.000167421. So the difference is about 0.000167. For x=0.01, arcsin(0.01)≈0.0100001667. So the difference is ~1.667e-6. So the approximation is very good for small x.

Therefore, summing up terms where each is approximated by x, leading to 1/2, seems correct. But the problem says 2/3. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the limit is of sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n, which would give something else. Let me check.

Wait, if the problem was lim_{n→∞} n * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), then the result would be different. Let's compute that. If we take n times the sum, which is n*(1/2 + o(1)) = n/2 + o(n), which would go to infinity. But that's not the case. Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo and the limit is supposed to be different.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) and the answer is 1/2, but the user wrote 2/3 by mistake. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's consider that the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's make a substitution m = n², so that k/m = k/n². Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/m). But m = n², so k goes up to n, which is much smaller than m. So k/m goes from 1/m to n/m = 1/n. So the terms inside arcsin are from 1/m to 1/n, which are all small. So again, the same as before.

Alternatively, think of the sum as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6. Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3 /6. The first sum is approximately n(n+1)/(2n²) ≈ 1/2. The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = (1/(6n⁶)) * [n²(n+1)^2]/4 ≈ (1/(6n⁶)) * (n^4)/4 = n^4/(24n^6) = 1/(24n²), which tends to 0. So the total sum is 1/2 + 0 = 1/2.

But the problem says 2/3. Wait, maybe the original problem was sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), which would be different. Let's check that. If it were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), then for large n, each term is arcsin(k/n) ≈ k/n + (k/n)^3 /6, and the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n k/n + sum_{k=1}^n (k/n)^3 /6. The first sum is (n+1)/2 ≈ n/2, and the second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³ / (6n³) = (n²(n+1)^2)/12 / (6n³) = (n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2)/72n³ ≈ n/72 + 1/36 + 1/(72n). So as n approaches infinity, the first term is n/2, the second term is n/72, but wait, the original sum would be n/2 + n/(72) + ... which would go to infinity. But that's not the case either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n. Let's compute that. If we have n * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ n*(1/2 + o(1)) = n/2 + o(n), which goes to infinity. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/(n²)) and the answer is 1/2, but due to a miscalculation in the problem statement, it's written as 2/3. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my process.

Wait, let me try to compute the sum numerically for a specific n. Let's take n=1000. Compute sum_{k=1}^{1000} arcsin(k/(1000)^2).

Each term is arcsin(k/1,000,000). For k=1: arcsin(1/1,000,000) ≈ 1/1,000,000 + (1/1,000,000)^3 /6 ≈1e-6 + 1.666e-18 ≈1e-6. Similarly for k=1000: arcsin(1000/1,000,000)=arcsin(0.001)≈0.0010001667. So each term is approximately k/1,000,000. The sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^{1000} k/1,000,000 = (1000*1001)/2 /1,000,000 ≈ (500500)/1,000,000 = 0.5005. So approximately 0.5005, which is close to 1/2. For n=1,000,000, the sum would be approximately 1/2. So this numerical check supports my analytical result of 1/2. Therefore, the problem's stated answer of 2/3 might be incorrect, or perhaps there's a misinterpretation.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit of sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n², which would be different. Let's check. If we compute n² * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), then using the approximation arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)] ≈ (n(n+1)/2)/n² + (sum k³)/(6n⁶) ≈ (1/2 + 1/(2n)) + (n²(n+1)^2/4)/(6n⁶) ≈ 1/2 + 1/(2n) + (n^4)/24n⁶ ≈ 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²). Multiplying by n² gives n²*(1/2) + n²*(1/(2n)) + n²*(1/(24n²)) = n²/2 + n/2 + 1/24. As n approaches infinity, this goes to infinity. But that's not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is different. Wait, perhaps the sum is over k from 1 to n of arcsin(k/n²), but I have to consider that for each n, the sum is from k=1 to n, and as n approaches infinity, the behavior is different. Wait, but as n approaches infinity, the terms k/n² go to zero for each fixed k, but k goes up to n. So the maximum term is n/n² = 1/n, which still goes to zero. Therefore, the entire sum is approaching zero? No, wait, the sum is adding up n terms each of order 1/n², so the sum is of order n*(1/n²) = 1/n, which approaches zero. But that contradicts my previous result. Wait, this is confusing.

Wait, let's clarify. If each term is arcsin(k/n²), which is approximately k/n² for small k/n². The sum is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = 1/2 + 1/(2n). As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. So the sum is approaching 1/2. Therefore, the limit is 1/2. Therefore, the answer should be 1/2, but the problem states 2/3. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or the provided answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to evaluate the limit of sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n. Let's check that. If we compute n * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ n*(1/2 + o(1)) = n/2 + o(n), which tends to infinity. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) and the answer is 1/2. Therefore, the user might have mistyped the answer. Alternatively, maybe I missed a step in my calculation.

Wait, let me try one last time. If I use the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)]. The first sum is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = 1/2 + 1/(2n). The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [n²(n+1)^2/4]/(6n⁶) = [n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2]/24n^6 = (1 + 2/n + 1/n²)/24n² ≈ 1/(24n²) for large n. So the total sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²), which tends to 1/2 as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit is 1/2.

Given that multiple analytical methods and numerical checks all lead to 1/2, I believe that the correct answer is 1/2, and the problem's stated answer of 2/3 is likely incorrect. Perhaps there was a typo in the problem or the answer provided. Therefore, unless there's a different approach or a correction in the problem statement, the limit should be 1/2.

To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}
\\]

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

Additionally, we verified using integral comparison. The integral \\(\\int_{0}^{n} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{n^2}\\right) \\, dx\\) was evaluated and found to approach \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), confirming our result.

Thus, the limit is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that for small angles, arcsin(x) is approximately equal to x. But wait, when does that approximation hold? For small x, right? So if k/n² is small, which it is for large n since k is at most n, then k/n² would be at most n/n² = 1/n, which does go to zero as n approaches infinity. So maybe I can approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² in the sum?

But wait, the problem is that we're summing over k from 1 to n. So even though each term is small, the number of terms is n, so the total sum might not be negligible. Let me check. If I approximate arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n², then the sum becomes approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k/n². The sum of k from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2, so dividing by n² gives (n+1)/(2n) which approaches 1/2 as n goes to infinity. But wait, the problem is asking for the limit, and according to this approximation, it would be 1/2. However, the user wrote ""Return your fina Evaluate the limit: [...] \\frac{2}{3}$"" which might be a typo, but the limit is 1/2? Hmm, maybe not. Wait, maybe the approximation is too rough?

Alternatively, maybe I need a better approximation for arcsin(x) when x is small. The Taylor series for arcsin(x) is x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So perhaps the first term is x, but higher order terms might contribute when summed over many terms. Let's see. So if I take arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)³/6, then the sum would be approximately sum(k/n²) + sum((k/n²)³/6). Let's compute both parts.

First part: sum(k/n²) from k=1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (n+1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2 as n goes to infinity. Second part: sum((k³)/(6n⁶)) from k=1 to n. The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2, so dividing by n⁶ gives [n²(n+1)²/4]/n⁶ = (n+1)²/(4n⁴) ≈ 1/(4n²) as n goes to infinity. Then multiplying by 1/6 gives 1/(24n²), which goes to 0. So the second term is negligible. So maybe the approximation is okay, and the limit is 1/2?

But wait, maybe the higher-order terms are not negligible when summed up? Let me check again. The first-order approximation gives 1/2, and the second-order term gives something that goes to zero. So perhaps the limit is indeed 1/2. But the user might have thought it's 2/3. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the integral of arcsin(x) instead of summing. Since we're dealing with a sum that resembles a Riemann sum. Let's see. If we let x_k = k/n, then the interval is from 0 to 1, and Δx = 1/n. But wait, in the sum, we have arcsin(k/n²). Let me set x_k = k/n². Then as n approaches infinity, x_k ranges from 1/n² up to 1/n. But 1/n approaches 0, so x_k is approaching 0 for all k. So the argument of arcsin is approaching 0, so arcsin(x_k) ≈ x_k. Therefore, the sum is approximately sum(k/n²) from k=1 to n, which is (1/n²)(n(n+1)/2) ≈ (1/n²)(n²/2) = 1/2 as n approaches infinity. So again, the same result.

But maybe there's a different approach. Let me think. If I use the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 for small x, then the sum becomes sum(k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6) = sum(k/n²) + sum(k³/(6n^6)). As before, the first sum is ~1/2, the second sum is O(1/n²), so negligible. Therefore, the limit is 1/2.

Wait, but maybe the original problem had a different expression? The user wrote ""Evaluate the limit: [...] \\frac{2}{3}$"". Maybe there's a typo, and the original problem is different. But given the problem as stated, the limit should be 1/2. Alternatively, maybe I need to check with another method.

Alternatively, maybe using the integral test or comparing the sum to an integral. Let me consider the sum S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's make substitution x = k/n², so k = n²x. Then, the sum can be approximated by an integral. Let's see, the step between consecutive k is 1, so dx = 1/n². Therefore, the sum S ≈ integral from x=1/n² to x=n/n² = 1/n of arcsin(x) * n² dx. Wait, that might not make sense. Wait, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) * Δk, where Δk =1, but to approximate as an integral, we need to relate it to an integral over x. Let's see:

Let x = k/n². Then k = n²x, so Δx = Δk / n² = 1/n². Therefore, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x) * Δx * n². So S ≈ n² ∫_{x=1/n²}^{x=1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Now, if n is large, the integral is from x=0 to x=1/n. So S ≈ n² ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Let's compute this integral.

We know that arcsin(x) is approximately x for small x, so ∫₀^{1/n} x dx = [x²/2]₀^{1/n} = 1/(2n²). Therefore, S ≈ n² * 1/(2n²) = 1/2. Again, the same result. Therefore, the limit is 1/2.

But wait, maybe I need to compute the integral more accurately. Let's compute ∫ arcsin(x) dx. The integral of arcsin(x) dx is x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²) + C. So evaluating from 0 to 1/n:

[ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2 ) ] - [0 + sqrt(1 - 0)] = (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - 1.

But for large n, arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3/6, and sqrt(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²). So substituting:

≈ (1/n)(1/n) + (1/n)(1/(6n³)) + [1 - 1/(2n²)] - 1

≈ 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) + 1 - 1/(2n²) -1

= (1/n² - 1/(2n²)) + 1/(6n⁴)

= -1/(2n²) + 1/(6n⁴)

Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx ≈ -1/(2n²). Therefore, S ≈ n² * (-1/(2n²)) = -1/2. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, but the original approximation was S ≈ n² ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx, which we approximated as 1/2, but when computing the integral more accurately, we get -1/(2n²). Wait, there's a contradiction here. That suggests an error in my reasoning.

Wait, no. Wait, when I approximated arcsin(x) ≈ x, the integral was 1/(2n²), so S ≈ n² * 1/(2n²) = 1/2. But when computing the integral more accurately, I get ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx ≈ -1/(2n²). That can't be. Wait, clearly, there's a mistake here.

Wait, let's recalculate the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to 1/n. The integral is:

x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²) evaluated from 0 to 1/n.

At x = 1/n:

(1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2 )

At x = 0:

0 + sqrt(1 - 0) = 1

Therefore, the integral is:

(1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - 1

Now, for large n, arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3/6, so:

(1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³)) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²) -1

≈ 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) + [1 - 1/(2n²)] -1

= 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) + 1 - 1/(2n²) -1

= (1/n² - 1/(2n²)) + 1/(6n⁴)

= -1/(2n²) + 1/(6n⁴)

Therefore, the integral is approximately -1/(2n²). But that's negative, which contradicts the positive terms in the sum. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my approach.

Wait a minute, arcsin(x) is positive for x > 0, so the integral from 0 to 1/n should be positive. But according to this, it's negative. That can't be. So clearly, I made an error in expanding sqrt(1 - 1/n²). Let's check that.

sqrt(1 - 1/n²) = (1 - 1/n²)^{1/2} ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²) - 1/(8n^4) + ... So the expansion is 1 - 1/(2n²) - 1/(8n^4) + ... So then:

(1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²) -1

≈ (1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³)) + [1 - 1/(2n²) - 1/(8n^4)] -1

= 1/n² + 1/(6n^4) + 1 -1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4) -1

= (1/n² -1/(2n²)) + (1/(6n^4) -1/(8n^4)) + (1 -1)

= (-1/(2n²)) + (1/(24n^4))

So the integral is approximately -1/(2n²) + 1/(24n^4). But this is negative, which is impossible because the integrand is positive. Therefore, my mistake must be in the expansion of arcsin(1/n). Let's redo that.

arcsin(x) for small x is x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3/6 + 3(1/n)^5/40 + ... So multiplying by 1/n gives:

(1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³) + ...) = 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) + ...

Then sqrt(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²) - 1/(8n^4) + ...

So adding that:

1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) + 1 - 1/(2n²) - 1/(8n^4) -1

= (1/n² -1/(2n²)) + (1/(6n^4) -1/(8n^4)) + (1 -1)

= (-1/(2n²)) + (1/(24n^4))

But this is still negative. That can't be. There must be a mistake in my approach here.

Wait, no. Wait, the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to 1/n is equal to:

[ x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²) ] from 0 to 1/n

= (1/n arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²)) - (0 + 1)

= (1/n arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²) -1 )

But sqrt(1 - 1/n²) is less than 1, so sqrt(1 - 1/n²) -1 is negative. So the first term is positive (1/n arcsin(1/n)), and the second term is negative. So depending on which is larger.

But arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + 1/(6n³), so 1/n arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n² + 1/(6n^4). Then sqrt(1 -1/n²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4). So:

1/n arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 -1/n²) -1 ≈ (1/n² + 1/(6n^4)) + (1 -1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4)) -1

= 1/n² + 1/(6n^4) +1 -1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4) -1

= (-1/(2n²) ) + (1/(6n^4) -1/(8n^4))

= -1/(2n²) + (1/(24n^4))

So the integral is approximately -1/(2n²) + 1/(24n^4). But this is negative, which is impossible because the integral of a positive function over a positive interval should be positive. Therefore, my mistake must be in the expansion.

Wait, sqrt(1 - x²) is less than 1, so sqrt(1 -1/n²) -1 is negative. However, 1/n arcsin(1/n) is positive. So which term dominates?

Let's compute the numerical value for n=1000. Let's compute:

1/n arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/1000 * (1/1000 + 1/(6*1000^3)) ≈ 1e-6 + 1e-12 ≈ 1e-6.

sqrt(1 -1/n²) -1 ≈ sqrt(1 - 1e-6) -1 ≈ (1 - 0.5e-6 - 0.125e-12) -1 ≈ -0.5e-6 - 0.125e-12.

So total integral ≈ 1e-6 -0.5e-6 = 0.5e-6, which is positive. So my earlier approximation was wrong. So perhaps I need to compute the difference more carefully.

Wait, when I did the expansions, I get:

1/n arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n² + 1/(6n^4)

sqrt(1 -1/n²) -1 ≈ -1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4)

Therefore, the integral is approximately:

(1/n² + 1/(6n^4)) + (-1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4)) = (-1/(2n²)) + (1/(6n^4) -1/(8n^4)) = -1/(2n²) + (1/(24n^4)) ≈ -1/(2n²). But when n=1000, this would be -0.5e-6, which conflicts with the actual value of ~0.5e-6. Therefore, there must be an error in the expansion.

Wait, perhaps the expansion of sqrt(1 - x²) is wrong. Wait, sqrt(1 -x²) = 1 - x²/2 - x^4/8 - ... So when x=1/n, sqrt(1 -1/n²) = 1 -1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4) - ... So sqrt(1 -1/n²) -1 = -1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4) - ... So that is correct. Then 1/n arcsin(1/n) = (1/n)(1/n +1/(6n³) + ...) = 1/n² +1/(6n^4) + ...

So adding those two:

1/n² +1/(6n^4) -1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4) = (-1/(2n²)) + (1/(6n^4) -1/(8n^4)) = -1/(2n²) + ( (4 -3)/24n^4 ) = -1/(2n²) + 1/(24n^4). But when n=1000, this would be approximately -0.5e-6 + 0.004166...e-12 ≈ -0.5e-6, but the actual value is positive 0.5e-6. Therefore, the approximation is missing something.

Wait, perhaps the expansion of arcsin(1/n) is not sufficient? Let me check. The Taylor expansion of arcsin(x) around x=0 is x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So arcsin(1/n) = 1/n + 1/(6n³) + 3/(40n^5) + ... So multiplying by 1/n gives:

1/n² + 1/(6n^4) + 3/(40n^6) + ...

Then sqrt(1 -1/n²) -1 = -1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4) - 1/(16n^6) - ... So adding them:

1/n² +1/(6n^4) +3/(40n^6) -1/(2n²) -1/(8n^4) -1/(16n^6) = (-1/(2n²)) + (1/(6n^4) -1/(8n^4)) + (3/(40n^6) -1/(16n^6)) + ...

= -1/(2n²) + ( (4 -3)/24n^4 ) + ( (3*4 -10)/160n^6 ) + ...

= -1/(2n²) + 1/(24n^4) - (1/160n^6) + ...

Hmm, so still negative. But the actual value for n=1000 is positive. Therefore, there must be an error in the approach.

Alternatively, maybe the integral approximation is not the right way here. Let's think again.

If we have the sum S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's make substitution m = n². Then k ranges from 1 to n, so k/m = k/n². Wait, maybe not helpful.

Alternatively, note that for large n, k/n² is very small, so arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6. So the sum S ≈ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n^6)].

The first term is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² ≈ (n²/2)/n² = 1/2.

The second term is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n^6) = [ (n(n+1)/2)^2 ]/(6n^6) ≈ [n^4/4]/(6n^6) = 1/(24n²), which goes to 0 as n approaches infinity.

Therefore, S ≈ 1/2 + o(1). Therefore, the limit is 1/2.

But why does the integral approach give a negative value? Because when we approximated the integral, we might have missed some terms. Alternatively, perhaps the integral approach is not the correct way here because the sum is not a Riemann sum in the usual sense. A Riemann sum would have the form sum f(x_k) Δx, but here we have sum f(k/n²) where Δx would be 1/n². But the sum is over k=1 to n, so the number of terms is n, and each term is f(k/n²). So the total sum is like n * f(1/n²), but since k varies, it's more complicated.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Stolz-Cesàro theorem? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe compare the sum to an integral.

Wait, let's consider the sum S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n². Then S ≈ sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² ≈ 1/2. To see if the approximation holds, we can check the error term.

The error in approximating arcsin(x) by x is O(x³). So each term has an error of O((k/n²)^3). Therefore, the total error is O( sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3 ) = O( sum_{k=1}^n k³/n^6 ) = O( (n^4)/n^6 ) = O(1/n²), which goes to zero as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/2.

Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}.

But the user wrote ""Return your fina Evaluate the limit: [...] \\frac{2}{3}$"". Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me verify once again.

If I compute the sum S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). For large n, each term is small, so arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6. The sum becomes approximately sum(k/n²) + (1/6) sum(k³/n^6). The first sum is ~1/2, the second sum is ~ (1/6)(n^4/4)/n^6 = (n^4/24)/n^6 = 1/(24n²) → 0. Therefore, the limit is 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem was sum_{k=1}^{n^2} arcsin(k/n²), but even then, the sum would be approximated by sum_{k=1}^{n^2} k/n² = (n²(n²+1)/2)/n² ≈ (n^4/2)/n² = n²/2, which would go to infinity. But the problem as stated is up to k=n.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider the average of the terms. The average term is arcsin(k/n²) for k from 1 to n. If we model k as a variable in the interval [1, n], then k/n² ranges from 1/n² to 1/n. So it's a small interval near zero. The average value of arcsin(x) over x from 0 to 1/n can be approximated by the average of x over that interval, which is (1/n)/2 = 1/(2n). Therefore, the average term is approximately 1/(2n), and the sum is n * 1/(2n) = 1/2. Again, same result.

Therefore, after multiple methods and checks, the limit should be 1/2. So I think the answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k equals 1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let's start by understanding what each part of this expression does. 

First, the arcsin function. Arcsin(x) is the inverse sine function, which gives me the angle whose sine is x. The domain of arcsin is between -1 and 1, but since k and n are positive integers here, k/n² will be positive and less than or equal to 1 because k is at most n, so k/n² is at most 1/n. Therefore, each term in the sum is a real number between 0 and π/2. 

Now, the sum is from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). So, for each k, we're taking arcsin(k/n²) and adding them all up. Then we take the limit as n goes to infinity. 

I remember that when dealing with limits of sums, especially as n becomes large, sometimes we can approximate the sum with an integral. That might be a useful approach here. Let me think about how to apply that. 

But before jumping into integrals, let's recall the behavior of arcsin(x) for small x. For very small x, arcsin(x) can be approximated by x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... using the Taylor series expansion. Since k/n² is small when n is large (because k is up to n, so k/n² is up to 1/n, which goes to 0 as n becomes large), maybe we can approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² + higher order terms. 

If that's the case, then the sum would be approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k/n². Let's compute that sum. The sum of k from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2, so the sum of k/n² would be [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (n+1)/(2n) = 1/2 + 1/(2n). As n approaches infinity, this approaches 1/2. But wait, the answer given is 2/3. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought. Maybe my approximation is too simplistic?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider higher-order terms in the expansion of arcsin(x). Let me check the Taylor series again. Arcsin(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (3/40)x⁵ + ... So, if I approximate arcsin(k/n²) as k/n² + (1/6)(k/n²)³, then the sum would be sum(k/n²) + sum((1/6)(k³/n⁶)). Let's compute both parts.

First part: sum(k/n²) = (1/n²)(n(n+1)/2) ≈ (n²)/2n² = 1/2 as n becomes large.

Second part: sum((1/6)(k³/n⁶)) = (1/6n⁶) sum(k³). The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2 ≈ n⁴/4 as n becomes large. Therefore, the second part is (1/6n⁶)(n⁴/4) = 1/(24n²). As n approaches infinity, this term goes to zero. 

So, adding the first part (1/2) and the second part (which tends to zero) gives 1/2. But the answer is supposed to be 2/3. Hmm, so my approximation is missing something. Maybe the higher-order terms in the Taylor series aren't negligible? Or perhaps the approximation isn't valid here?

Wait, maybe the substitution x = k/n² is better approached by considering n² as a large number, so k/n² is small, but maybe the sum of the terms isn't well-approximated by the integral. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approximate the sum.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the integral test or some other approximation method. Let's consider that the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by an integral. Let me set x = k/n², so when k goes from 1 to n, x goes from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. Wait, but as n approaches infinity, the upper limit becomes 0. Hmm, that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, let's consider the variable substitution. Let me set t = k/n. Then, k = tn, so when k goes from 1 to n, t goes from 1/n to 1. Then, the term inside arcsin becomes k/n² = t/n. So, arcsin(t/n). So, the sum becomes sum_{t=1/n, 2/n, ..., 1} arcsin(t/n). 

But how does that help? Maybe using the integral approximation here. The sum can be approximated by the integral from t=0 to t=1 of arcsin(t/n) dt, but scaled appropriately. Wait, but the step size in t is 1/n, so the sum is approximated by n * integral from 0 to 1 of arcsin(t/n) dt. Wait, maybe not exactly, but perhaps?

Alternatively, maybe using the Euler-Maclaurin formula for approximating sums with integrals. But that might be complicated. Alternatively, let's note that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. So, the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6]. Then, sum(k/n²) = (n(n+1)/2)/n² ≈ 1/2 + 1/(2n), and sum((k/n²)^3 /6) = (1/6n⁶) sum(k³). Sum(k³) ≈ n⁴/4, so that term is (1/6n⁶)(n⁴/4) = 1/(24n²). So again, the sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²). As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. But the answer is 2/3. So there's a discrepancy here.

Hmm, so perhaps my initial approximation is wrong. Maybe the arcsin(x) expansion isn't sufficient here? Wait, let's check the expansion again. Arcsin(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (3/40)x⁵ + ... So, for very small x, the first term is x, and the next term is (1/6)x³. So, if x is on the order of 1/n², then x³ is on the order of 1/n⁶. So, sum over k=1 to n of x³ would be sum over k=1 to n of (k/n²)^3 = sum(k³)/n⁶ ≈ (n⁴/4)/n⁶ = 1/(4n²). So, the sum of the x³ terms is approximately 1/(4n²), so when multiplied by 1/6, it's 1/(24n²). So, as n tends to infinity, that term tends to zero. Therefore, the sum is dominated by the first term, which is 1/2. But the answer is 2/3. So why the discrepancy?

Wait, maybe the problem is in the initial approximation. Let me check the problem again. The limit is as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). The answer given is 2/3. But according to my approximation, it's approaching 1/2. So where is the mistake?

Alternatively, perhaps the arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated better. Let's consider that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Therefore, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6]. Then, sum(k/n²) = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) = 1/2 + 1/(2n). The sum of (k/n²)^3 is sum(k³)/n⁶ ≈ (n⁴/4)/n⁶ = 1/(4n²). So, multiplying by 1/6 gives 1/(24n²). Therefore, the total sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²). As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. But the answer is 2/3. So, clearly, there's a problem here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approximation. Let's check the Taylor series again. The Taylor series for arcsin(x) is x + (1/6)x³ + (3/40)x⁵ + ... So, for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Therefore, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6]. Then, sum(k/n²) is indeed (n(n+1)/2)/n² ≈ 1/2 + 1/(2n). Sum((k/n²)^3 /6) is (1/6)(sum(k³)/n⁶) ≈ (1/6)(n⁴/4)/n⁶ = (1/6)(1/(4n²)) = 1/(24n²). Therefore, the sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²). Therefore, as n approaches infinity, the limit is 1/2. But the answer is supposed to be 2/3, so this must be wrong.

Hmm, maybe the initial approximation is not sufficient. Maybe higher-order terms are contributing? Let's check. The next term in the Taylor series is (3/40)x⁵. So, sum_{k=1}^n (3/40)(k/n²)^5. That would be (3/40)(sum(k^5)/n¹⁰). Sum(k^5) ≈ n⁶/6, so (3/40)(n⁶/6)/n¹⁰ = (3/40)(1/(6n⁴)) = 1/(80n⁴). Which tends to zero as n approaches infinity. So, even with higher-order terms, the sum is still approaching 1/2.

But the answer is 2/3. Therefore, my approach must be flawed. Maybe my approximation of arcsin(k/n²) is incorrect? Let's check for small x, arcsin(x) is approximately x + x³/6. But maybe for larger x, the approximation is worse? Wait, in this case, x is k/n², which is up to 1/n. So, as n approaches infinity, x is approaching zero. Therefore, the approximation should be valid. So why is the answer 2/3?

Wait, maybe the problem is in the step where I approximate the sum as an integral. Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by an integral. Let me set x = k/n², so k = xn², but that might complicate things. Alternatively, let's set t = k/n. Then, k = tn, so x = t/n. Then, the term inside arcsin is x = t/n. Therefore, arcsin(t/n). Then, the sum becomes sum_{t=1/n, 2/n, ..., 1} arcsin(t/n). 

Now, the sum can be approximated by the integral from t=0 to t=1 of arcsin(t/n) dt multiplied by n (since the spacing between t values is 1/n). So, the sum ≈ n * ∫₀¹ arcsin(t/n) dt. Let's compute this integral. Let me make a substitution: let u = t/n, so t = nu, dt = n du. The limits become u=0 to u=1/n. Wait, that might not help. Alternatively, since n is large, and t/n is small, maybe expand arcsin(t/n) as t/n + (t/n)^3 /6 + ... So, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ [t/n + (t/n)^3 /6 + ...] dt = [ (1/n) ∫₀¹ t dt + (1/(6n³)) ∫₀¹ t³ dt + ... ] = [ (1/n)(1/2) + (1/(6n³))(1/4) + ... ] = 1/(2n) + 1/(24n³) + ... Then, multiplying by n gives n*(1/(2n)) + n*(1/(24n³)) + ... = 1/2 + 1/(24n²) + ... So again, as n approaches infinity, the sum approaches 1/2. So this contradicts the given answer of 2/3. 

Therefore, there must be a mistake in the reasoning. Let me check the problem again. The problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). The answer is given as 2/3, but according to both the Taylor series approximation and the integral approximation, it's approaching 1/2. 

Wait, maybe the initial problem statement was mistyped? Let me check again. The user wrote: ""Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) 2/3"". Wait, maybe there's a typo here. Maybe the limit is 2/3, but the user wrote 2/3 next to the limit expression? Or perhaps the problem is to evaluate the limit, and the answer is 2/3? The original problem says: ""Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) 2/3"". Hmm, maybe there's a formatting issue. Perhaps the correct problem is to evaluate the limit, and the answer is 2/3? 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write the limit is equal to 2/3 and wants confirmation. But according to my calculations, it should approach 1/2. So why is there a discrepancy? 

Wait, perhaps I made a miscalculation in the sum. Let me recast the problem. Let me compute the sum S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's approximate arcsin(k/n²) for small x. As x approaches 0, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Therefore, S ≈ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6] = sum(k/n²) + sum((k/n²)^3 /6). 

Sum(k/n²) = (1/n²) sum(k) = (1/n²)(n(n+1)/2) = (n+1)/(2n) = 1/2 + 1/(2n). Sum((k/n²)^3 /6) = (1/6n⁶) sum(k³) = (1/6n⁶)(n⁴(n+1)^2/4) ≈ (1/6n⁶)(n⁶/4) = 1/24. Wait, hold on. Wait, sum(k³) from k=1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2. Therefore, sum(k³) ≈ (n²/4) as n becomes large. Therefore, sum((k/n²)^3 /6) = (1/6n⁶)(n²/4) = 1/(24n⁴). Therefore, this term tends to zero as n approaches infinity. 

Therefore, S ≈ 1/2 + 1/(2n) + o(1/n). Therefore, as n approaches infinity, the limit is 1/2. But the answer given is 2/3. So there's a conflict here. 

Wait, maybe the problem is not with the approximation but with the method. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is actually 1/2 and the given 2/3 is incorrect. But the user wrote ""Return your fina Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) 2/3"". Maybe the user is confused and wants the correct answer. 

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem was different. Let me check if maybe the argument inside arcsin is different. For example, if instead of k/n², it's k/n, then the limit would be different. For instance, if the sum was arcsin(k/n), then the limit would be ∫₀¹ arcsin(x) dx, which is [ -x√(1 - x²) + arcsin(x) ] from 0 to 1, which is π/2. But that's not the case here. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the original function is different. Alternatively, maybe the user is mistaken in providing the answer. 

Alternatively, let's try to compute the sum more accurately. Let's note that for small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + 3(k/n²)^5 /40 + ...]. Let's compute the sum up to the x³ term and see. 

First term: sum(k/n²) = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) = 1/2 + 1/(2n). 

Second term: sum((k/n²)^3 /6) = (1/6n⁶) sum(k³) ≈ (1/6n⁶)(n⁴/4) = 1/(24n²). 

Third term: sum(3(k/n²)^5 /40) = (3/40n¹⁰) sum(k⁵) ≈ (3/40n¹⁰)(n⁶/6) = (3/40)(1/(6n⁴)) = 1/(80n⁴). 

So, adding these up: 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²) + 1/(80n⁴) + ... As n approaches infinity, all the terms except the first one vanish. Therefore, the limit is 1/2. But the answer given is 2/3. Therefore, either there's a mistake in the problem statement, or my approach is wrong. 

Wait, let's try to compute the sum numerically for a large n. Let's take n = 1000. Compute sum_{k=1}^{1000} arcsin(k/(1000)^2). Since k/(1000)^2 is up to 1000/1,000,000 = 0.001. So, arcsin(0.001) ≈ 0.001 + (0.001)^3 /6 ≈ 0.001 + 0.0000000001666666... So, sum_{k=1}^{1000} [0.001 + ... ] is approximately sum(k/1,000,000) + sum((k^3)/6*1e-12). The first sum is (1,000*1001)/2 / 1,000,000 ≈ (500500)/1,000,000 ≈ 0.5005. The second sum is sum(k³)/6*1e-12. Sum(k³) from 1 to 1000 is (1000*1001/2)^2 ≈ (500500)^2 ≈ 250,500,250,000. So, sum(k³)/6*1e-12 ≈ 250,500,250,000 /6 *1e-12 ≈ 41,750,041.666... *1e-12 ≈ 0.00004175. Therefore, total sum ≈ 0.5005 + 0.00004175 ≈ 0.50054175. So, approximately 0.5005, which is close to 1/2. If n increases, say n=1,000,000, the sum would be approximately (1/2) + 1/(2*1,000,000) + ... which is approximately 0.500001. So, this suggests that the limit is indeed 1/2. 

But the problem states that the answer is 2/3. This is confusing. Maybe there's a miscalculation here. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had arcsin(k/n) instead of arcsin(k/n²). Let's check that. If the problem was arcsin(k/n), then for large n, arcsin(k/n) ≈ k/n + (k/n)^3 /6, and the sum would be sum(k/n) + sum((k/n)^3 /6). Sum(k/n) = (n(n+1)/2)/n = (n+1)/2 ≈ n/2, which goes to infinity. So that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit of the sum divided by n? But the original problem doesn't state that. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. If the limit is indeed 2/3, then my approach is missing something. Let me think differently. 

Wait, maybe the approximation of arcsin(x) isn't valid for all terms. For example, when k is close to n, k/n² is close to 1/n, which is still small, but perhaps the approximation isn't accurate enough. Wait, but even for k = n, x = n/n² = 1/n, which is small. So, the approximation should hold for all k from 1 to n. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's consider that arcsin(x) = ∫₀^x 1/√(1 - t²) dt. Therefore, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n ∫₀^{k/n²} 1/√(1 - t²) dt. Maybe exchanging the sum and integral? So, sum_{k=1}^n ∫₀^{k/n²} 1/√(1 - t²) dt = ∫₀^{1/n²} 1/√(1 - t²) dt + ∫₀^{2/n²} 1/√(1 - t²) dt + ... + ∫₀^{1/n} 1/√(1 - t²) dt. 

But integrating over t from 0 to k/n² for each k. This seems complicated. Alternatively, approximate the sum by an integral over t. Let's consider t as a variable, and for each t, how many k's satisfy t ≤ k/n². For a given t, the number of k's such that k ≥ tn². Since k ranges from 1 to n, t must be ≤ n/n² = 1/n. So, the maximum t is 1/n. Therefore, the sum can be approximated by the integral over t from 0 to 1/n of the number of k's times 1/√(1 - t²). 

But this seems tricky. Alternatively, the total sum is approximately equal to the integral from t=0 to t=1/n of (number of k's with k/n² ≥ t) * 1/√(1 - t²) dt. But this might not be straightforward. 

Alternatively, consider that the sum is approximately equal to the integral from t=0 to t=1/n of n * 1/√(1 - t²) dt. Wait, why n? Because for each t, the number of k's such that k/n² ≥ t is approximately n * t. Wait, maybe not. This is getting convoluted. 

Alternatively, use the average value. Since k/n² ranges from 1/n² to 1/n, and n is large, the average value of k/n² is approximately (1/n² + 1/n)/2 ≈ 1/(2n²). But arcsin(x) is approximately x, so the average term is approximately 1/(2n²), and the sum would be n * 1/(2n²) = 1/(2n), which tends to zero. But that contradicts the earlier result. So this approach is also flawed. 

Alternatively, maybe use the mean value theorem for sums. There exists some c in [0,1] such that sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = n * arcsin(c/n²). But as n approaches infinity, c/n² approaches zero, so arcsin(c/n²) ≈ c/n². Therefore, the sum would be approximately n * (c/n²) = c/n, which tends to zero. But this contradicts previous results. 

This is very confusing. According to multiple approaches—Taylor series expansion, integral approximation, numerical estimation—the limit should be 1/2. However, the given answer is 2/3. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, let me check the problem again. The user wrote: ""Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) 2/3"". Maybe the ""2/3"" is part of the limit expression? Perhaps the problem is to evaluate the limit, and the answer is 2/3, but the user made a formatting error. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit and the answer is 2/3, but my calculations are wrong. Let's try another approach. 

Consider that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Therefore, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6]. The sum is approximately sum(k/n²) + sum((k/n²)^3 /6). 

Sum(k/n²) = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) = 1/2 + 1/(2n). 

Sum((k/n²)^3 /6) = (1/6n⁶) sum(k³) = (1/6n⁶) * [n²(n+1)^2 /4] ≈ (1/6n⁶)(n⁴/4) = 1/(24n²). 

Therefore, sum ≈ 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²). As n→∞, this approaches 1/2. 

But perhaps the problem is expecting a different approach. Let me think. Maybe using the integral test for convergence, but here we are dealing with a sum that approximates an integral. 

Alternatively, consider that the sum is similar to the Riemann sum for the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to 1/n. But the step size is 1/n², which complicates things. 

Alternatively, use the trapezoidal rule or other numerical integration methods. But I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, note that the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n (k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6). Therefore, sum = (1/2 + o(1)) + (1/(24n²) + o(1/n²)). Therefore, the limit is 1/2. 

Given that multiple approaches lead to 1/2, and the numerical example with n=1000 gives approximately 0.5005, which is close to 0.5, I think the correct answer should be 1/2. Therefore, the given answer of 2/3 might be incorrect. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem statement. If the problem was to find the limit of the average of the sum, i.e., (1/n) sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), then the limit would be ∫₀¹ arcsin(x/n) dx, but as n→∞, this would be ∫₀¹ 0 dx = 0. Still not 2/3. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was to evaluate the limit of the sum multiplied by n. Then, the limit would be n*(1/2 + o(1)) → ∞. Not helpful. 

Alternatively, maybe the original problem had arcsin(k/n) instead of arcsin(k/n²). If that were the case, then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n). For large n, arcsin(k/n) ≈ k/n + (k/n)^3 /6. The sum would be approximately sum(k/n) + sum((k/n)^3 /6). Sum(k/n) = (n(n+1)/2)/n = (n+1)/2 ≈ n/2, which tends to infinity. So that's not the case. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit of the sum of arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n. Then, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) * n ≈ n*(1/2 + 1/(2n)) = n/2 + 1/2, which tends to infinity. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem had a different function inside arcsin. For example, if it was arcsin(k/(n² + k)), but that complicates things. 

Given all these considerations, I think the correct answer should be 1/2, and the given answer of 2/3 is incorrect. Therefore, either there is a mistake in the problem statement, or I'm missing something in my calculations. 

Wait, let's try another approach. Let's consider the sum S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me use the identity that arcsin(x) = ∫₀^x 1/√(1 - t²) dt. Therefore, S = sum_{k=1}^n ∫₀^{k/n²} 1/√(1 - t²) dt. 

Now, exchanging the sum and the integral, we get S = ∫₀^{1/n} sum_{k=1}^n [1/√(1 - t²)] χ_{[0, k/n²]}(t) dt. 

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, approximate the sum by an integral. Let's consider that for t between 0 and 1/n², each term in the sum contributes 1/√(1 - t²). For t between 1/n² and 2/n², there are two terms, etc. Therefore, the sum over k of 1/√(1 - t²) for t in [k/n², (k+1)/n²) is approximately n² * 1/√(1 - t²). Therefore, S ≈ ∫₀^{1/n} n² /√(1 - t²) dt. 

But this integral is n² ∫₀^{1/n} 1/√(1 - t²) dt ≈ n² ∫₀^{1/n} (1 + t²/2) dt ≈ n² [ t + t³/6 ] from 0 to 1/n ≈ n² (1/n + 1/(6n³)) = n + 1/(6n). As n approaches infinity, this tends to infinity. But this contradicts our previous result. Therefore, this approach must be wrong. 

Alternatively, perhaps this method isn't valid because the approximation of the sum by n²/√(1 - t²) is incorrect. 

Given that multiple methods give conflicting results, I'm confident that the correct answer is 1/2. Therefore, the given answer of 2/3 must be incorrect.

To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}
\\]

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

Additionally, we verified using integral comparison. The integral \\(\\int_{0}^{n} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{n^2}\\right) \\, dx\\) was evaluated and found to approach \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), confirming our result.

Thus, the limit is:

\\[
\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}
\\]

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that when dealing with limits involving sums, especially as n goes to infinity, Riemann sums often come into play. A Riemann sum approximates the integral of a function over an interval by dividing the interval into small subintervals, evaluating the function at certain points in each subinterval, and then multiplying by the width of each subinterval. Then, summing all those products gives an approximation of the integral. As the number of subintervals increases (i.e., as n approaches infinity), the Riemann sum should converge to the exact value of the integral.

But in this case, the function inside the sum is arcsin(k/n²). The argument of the arcsin function is k/n². Since k ranges from 1 to n, the largest value of the argument is n/n² = 1/n. So as n becomes very large, the argument of arcsin is approaching zero. That makes sense because for small x, arcsin(x) is approximately equal to x + x³/6 + ... So maybe I can approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² when n is large. Then the sum would be approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k/n². Let's check that.

The sum from k=1 to n of k is n(n+1)/2. So the sum of k/n² would be [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (n+1)/(2n) = (1 + 1/n)/2. As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. But wait, the original problem says the limit is 2/3. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought. Maybe my approximation is too crude?

Wait, perhaps I need to consider higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of arcsin(x). Let me recall that for small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So if I approximate arcsin(k/n²) as k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6, then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n^6)].

Then, adding the two sums: sum_{k=1}^n k/n² is (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (1 + 1/n)/2 as before, and sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n^6). The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2, so dividing by 6n^6 gives [n²(n+1)^2/4]/(6n^6) = (n²(n² + 2n +1)/4)/(6n^6) = (n^4 + 2n^3 + n²)/(24n^6) = (1 + 2/n + 1/n²)/(24n²). As n approaches infinity, this term tends to zero. So the total sum would be approximately 1/2. But the problem states the limit is 2/3. So my approximation must be missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approximation isn't sufficient because even though each term is small, the sum of many small terms might lead to a larger contribution. Wait, but if each term is approximated by its linear term, the sum still gives 1/2. But the problem says 2/3, so perhaps I need a better approach.

Wait, maybe using Riemann sums is not the right approach here. Let me think again. The sum is from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). If I let x = k/n², then as n becomes large, x ranges from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. But as n approaches infinity, the maximum x is 1/n, which tends to zero. So all the arguments of arcsin are approaching zero. Therefore, arcsin(x) ≈ x for small x. So the sum should be approximately sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²) = [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (1 + 1/n)/2 → 1/2 as n→infty. But the problem states the limit is 2/3. So clearly, there's a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly? Let me check again. The user wrote: Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). The limit is supposed to be 2/3? But according to my calculation, it's 1/2. Hmm. Maybe there's a miscalculation.

Wait, let's check the sum more carefully. Sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). If we approximate arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6, then the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n^6)]. The first part is (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (1 + 1/n)/2. The second part is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n^6). The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2. So substituting that in, we get [n²(n+1)^2/4]/(6n^6) = [n^4 + 2n^3 + n²]/(24n^6) = [1 + 2/n + 1/n²]/(24n²). As n→infty, this term goes to zero. Therefore, the total sum is approximately 1/2. But the problem states the limit is 2/3. So why is there a discrepancy?

Wait, perhaps the original problem is different? Maybe it's arcsin(k/n) instead of arcsin(k/n²)? Let me check the user's input again. The user wrote: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). So that's correct as stated. Then why does the answer differ?

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider a different approach. Let me consider the integral approximation. If the sum is approximated by an integral, maybe integrating arcsin(x) from x=1/n² to x=1/n. Wait, but the sum is over k, and each term is arcsin(k/n²). So perhaps the sum is like a Riemann sum with step size 1/n²? Wait, but the variable here is k, so if we set x_k = k/n², then the step size between x_k and x_{k+1} is 1/n². But the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k). To approximate this sum as an integral, we might need to relate it to the integral of arcsin(x) over some interval. However, the interval here is from x=1/n² to x=1/n, but as n becomes large, the upper limit approaches zero. So the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to 1/n. But integrating arcsin(x) is a bit complicated. Let me recall that the integral of arcsin(x) dx is x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²) + C. So integrating from 0 to 1/n gives [x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²)] from 0 to 1/n. At x=1/n, this is (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²). At x=0, it's 0 + 1. So the integral is approximately (1/n)(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - 1. Wait, but as n→infty, 1/n² approaches zero, so arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n, so the first term is (1/n)(1/n) = 1/n², and sqrt(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²). Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx ≈ [1/n² + 1 - 1/(2n²) -1] = (1/n² - 1/(2n²)) = 1/(2n²). So the integral is approximately 1/(2n²). But if we have n terms, each of size approximately 1/n², then the total sum would be n*(1/n²) = 1/n, which tends to zero. But this contradicts our previous approximation. So this approach seems off.

Wait, maybe the Riemann sum analogy isn't directly applicable here. Let me think differently. If we have the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), and we approximate arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n², then the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (1 + 1/n)/2. As n→infty, this tends to 1/2. But the problem says the limit is 2/3, so there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, maybe the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is too simplistic here. Let's consider higher-order terms. The Taylor series for arcsin(x) around x=0 is x + x³/6 + (3x⁵)/40 + ... So, if I take two terms, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6]. The first part is (1 + 1/n)/2, and the second part is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n^6). Let's compute that sum. The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2. Therefore, substituting, we have:

sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n^6) = [n²(n+1)^2/4]/(6n^6) = [n^4 + 2n^3 + n²]/(24n^6) = [1 + 2/n + 1/n²]/(24n²). As n→infty, this tends to 1/(24n²), which goes to zero. Therefore, even with the second term, the total sum is approaching 1/2. So why does the problem state the limit is 2/3?

Hmm, perhaps the original problem is different. Let me check again. The user wrote: Evaluate the limit: \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right). The user also mentioned that the answer is \\frac{2}{3}, but according to my calculations, it's 1/2. So either there's a mistake in the problem statement, or I'm missing something.

Wait, maybe the problem is not a sum of arcsin(k/n²), but arcsin(k/n). Let me check: if it were arcsin(k/n), then for large n, k/n ranges from 1/n to 1, and the limit would be a different integral. But the user specified k/n². Alternatively, maybe the exponent is different.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to use a different approximation for arcsin(x). Let me think. For small x, arcsin(x) is approximately x + x³/6, but maybe there's a better approximation for the sum. Alternatively, maybe using the integral test or another method.

Wait, another approach: consider that sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by the integral from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) dk. But integrating with respect to k. Let me set t = k/n², so k = t n², dk = n² dt. Then the integral becomes ∫_{t=1/n²}^{t=1/n} arcsin(t) n² dt. As n→infty, the limits of integration are from 0 to 0, but perhaps expanding arcsin(t) for small t. So arcsin(t) ≈ t + t³/6. Then the integral becomes n² ∫_{0}^{1/n} (t + t³/6) dt = n² [ (t²/2 + t⁴/24) ] from 0 to 1/n = n² [ (1/(2n²) + 1/(24n^4)) ] = n²*(1/(2n²) + 1/(24n^4)) = 1/2 + 1/(24n²). As n→infty, this tends to 1/2. So again, the integral approximation gives 1/2. But the problem states the limit is 2/3.

Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly. If the exponent in the denominator were different, like n instead of n², then the limit would be 2/3. Let's check: suppose the problem was sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n). Then for large n, k/n ranges from 1/n to 1, and the sum can be approximated by the integral from 0 to 1 of arcsin(x) dx. The integral of arcsin(x) dx is x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²). Evaluated from 0 to 1, this is [1*π/2 + 0] - [0 + 1] = π/2 -1 ≈ 0.5708, which is approximately 17.08/30, but 2/3 is 0.666..., so that's not matching either. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^3). Let me try that. If it's k/n^3, then the sum becomes approximately sum_{k=1}^n (k/n^3) = (n(n+1)/2)/n^3 = (1 + 1/n)/(2n) → 0 as n→infty. Not 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{1/2}), but that seems unlikely. The user wrote k/n². Maybe the problem is correct, but my initial approximation is missing something.

Wait, perhaps instead of approximating each term, I should use the Taylor series for arcsin(x) up to a certain order and sum the series. Let's consider that.

We have arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So for each term in the sum, arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + 3(k/n²)^5 /40 + ... Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n^6) + 3k^5/(40n^{10}) + ...]. 

The first term sum is (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (1 + 1/n)/2 → 1/2.

The second term sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n^6) = [n²(n+1)^2/4]/(6n^6) = [n^4 + 2n^3 + n²]/(24n^6) = [1 + 2/n + 1/n²]/(24n²) → 0 as n→infty.

The third term is sum_{k=1}^n 3k^5/(40n^{10}) = 3/(40n^{10}) sum_{k=1}^n k^5. The sum of k^5 from 1 to n is approximately n^6/6. So this term is 3/(40n^{10})*(n^6/6) = 3/(240n^4) → 0.

So all higher-order terms vanish as n→infty. Therefore, the total sum is approaching 1/2. But the problem states the limit is 2/3. Therefore, there's a contradiction here. Either the problem is incorrect, or I'm missing a crucial step.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe instead of approximating arcsin(k/n²) as k/n², I should use a better approximation. Let's recall that for small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So if we take two terms, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n^6)]. The first term is (1 + 1/n)/2, and the second term is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n^6). As computed before, the second term tends to zero. So the total sum is approximately 1/2. But the problem says 2/3. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not in the approximation but in the way the sum is structured. Let me think: the sum is from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). If we make a substitution, let m = n². Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{sqrt(m)} arcsin(k/m). But as m approaches infinity, sqrt(m) also approaches infinity. So the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^{\\sqrt{m}} arcsin(k/m). Maybe this can be approximated by an integral. Let's set x = k/m, so k = xm, dk = m dx. The sum becomes approximately ∫_{0}^{1/m} arcsin(x) m dx. Wait, but when k ranges from 1 to sqrt(m), x ranges from 1/m to sqrt(m)/m = 1/sqrt(m). So the integral would be ∫_{1/m}^{1/sqrt(m)} arcsin(x) m dx. 

But as m approaches infinity, the lower limit approaches 0 and the upper limit approaches 0. So the integral becomes m * ∫_{0}^{1/sqrt(m)} arcsin(x) dx. For small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x, so the integral is approximately ∫_{0}^{1/sqrt(m)} x dx = [x²/2] from 0 to 1/sqrt(m) = 1/(2m). Then multiplying by m gives m * 1/(2m) = 1/2. So again, the approximation gives 1/2. So why does the problem say 2/3?

Wait, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me consider that for large n, k is much smaller than n², so the argument k/n² is very small. Therefore, arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6] = (n(n+1)/2)/n² + sum_{k=1}^n (k^3)/(6n^6). The first term is (1 + 1/n)/2 → 1/2. The second term sum is sum_{k=1}^n k^3/(6n^6). The sum of k^3 from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2. Therefore, the second term is [n²(n+1)^2 /4]/(6n^6) = [n^4 + 2n^3 + n²]/(24n^6) = [1 + 2/n + 1/n²]/(24n²) → 0. So again, the total sum tends to 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe using the inequality that for small x, arcsin(x) ≥ x. So sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≥ sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (1 + 1/n)/2. And since arcsin(x) ≤ x + x³/6 for small x, then sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≤ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n^6)] ≈ (1 + 1/n)/2 + negligible terms. Therefore, the sum is squeezed between (1 + 1/n)/2 and approximately the same, so the limit is 1/2. Therefore, the problem's stated answer of 2/3 must be incorrect, or there's a typo.

Wait, but the user wrote ""the answer is \\frac{2}{3}"". Maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). If we consider the substitution x = k/n², then the sum is over x = 1/n², 2/n², ..., n/n² = 1/n. The width between consecutive x's is 1/n². So if we approximate the sum by an integral, it would be approximately ∫_{x=0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) n² dx. Wait, because the number of terms is n, and the width between terms is 1/n², so the total ""area"" would be n*(1/n²)*arcsin(x_k). Wait, no, actually, in a Riemann sum, the sum is approximately ∫_{a}^{b} f(x) dx, where f(x) is evaluated at the points x_k, and the step size is Δx. Here, the points are x_k = k/n², and the step size Δx = 1/n². Therefore, the sum is approximately ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) / Δx dx. Wait, no, the Riemann sum is sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k) Δx ≈ ∫_{a}^{b} f(x) dx. But in this case, we have sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k) ≈ ∫_{0}^{1/n} (Δx)^{-1} arcsin(x) dx. Wait, that seems off.

Alternatively, think of it as the sum is equal to sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k), where x_k = k/n². The step size between x_k and x_{k+1} is Δx = 1/n². The number of terms is n. So the Riemann sum for the integral of arcsin(x) from x=0 to x=1/n would be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k) Δx ≈ ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Therefore, the sum is approximately ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx / Δx. Wait, that seems complicated.

Let me compute the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to 1/n: as before, it's [x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²)] from 0 to 1/n. At x=1/n, that's (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²). At x=0, it's 0 + 1. So the integral is approximately (1/n)(1/n) + (1 - 1/(2n²)) - 1 = 1/n² + 1 - 1/(2n²) - 1 = (1/n² - 1/(2n²)) = 1/(2n²). So the integral is approximately 1/(2n²). Then, the sum is approximately ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx / Δx = [1/(2n²)] / (1/n²) = 1/2. So again, the sum approaches 1/2. Therefore, this confirms the earlier result.

But the problem states the answer is 2/3. There must be a mistake either in the problem statement or in my analysis. Let me check once more.

Wait, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), and the user wrote k/n² by mistake. If it were k/n, then the sum would be approximately the integral from 0 to 1 of arcsin(x) dx, which is π/2 - 1 ≈ 0.5708, but that's not 2/3 either. Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{3/2}), but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's consider the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me use the identity that arcsin(x) = ∫_{0}^{x} dt / sqrt(1 - t²). Therefore, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n ∫_{0}^{k/n²} dt / sqrt(1 - t²). Then, exchanging the sum and the integral, we get ∫_{0}^{1/n} sum_{k=1}^n [1 / sqrt(1 - t²)] dt. Wait, but t ranges from 0 to 1/n, and for each t, the number of k's such that k/n² ≥ t is k ≥ n² t. So the sum over k=1 to n of [1 / sqrt(1 - t²)] for t < k/n². This seems complicated.

Alternatively, approximate the sum as an integral. Let me set t = k/n², so k = t n², dk = n² dt. Then the sum becomes ∫_{t=1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(t) n² dt. As before, for small t, arcsin(t) ≈ t, so the integral is approximately ∫_{0}^{1/n} t n² dt = n² ∫_{0}^{1/n} t dt = n² [t²/2] from 0 to 1/n = n²*(1/(2n²)) = 1/2. So again, 1/2.

Wait, but the problem says 2/3. Maybe the original problem was different. For example, if the exponent was 3/2, like sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{3/2}), then the sum would be different. Let's try that. If it's arcsin(k/n^{3/2}), then for large n, k/n^{3/2} is small for k up to n^{3/2}. But the sum is up to k=n, so the largest term is n/n^{3/2} = 1/n^{1/2}, which still approaches zero. So the sum would be approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n^{3/2} = [n(n+1)/2]/n^{3/2} = (1 + 1/n)/2n^{1/2} → 0. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{1/2}). Then, the largest term is n/n^{1/2} = n^{1/2}, which is large, so arcsin(n^{1/2}) is undefined. So that can't be.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{1}) but with a different exponent. But no, the user wrote n².

Wait, perhaps the problem is from a different source, and there was a typo. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider a different approximation. Let me think again.

Wait, there's another approach: consider that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Therefore, the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n^6)]. The first term is (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (1 + 1/n)/2. The second term sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n^6) = [n²(n+1)^2/4]/(6n^6) = [n^4 + 2n^3 + n²]/(24n^6) = [1 + 2/n + 1/n²]/(24n²). As n→infty, this tends to zero. Therefore, the total sum is approaching 1/2. Therefore, unless there's a higher-order term that I'm missing, the limit should be 1/2.

But the problem states the answer is 2/3. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different approximation for arcsin(x). Let me recall that for small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So perhaps considering more terms would help, but even with more terms, the higher-order terms vanish as n→infty because they are divided by higher powers of n.

Alternatively, maybe using the average value. The sum is n terms, each approximately k/n². The average value of k from 1 to n is (n+1)/2. So the average term is approximately (n+1)/(2n²). Multiplying by n gives (n+1)/(2n) → 1/2. So again, the same result.

Wait, perhaps the problem is in the exponent. If the exponent were 1 instead of 2, like k/n, then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n). For large n, k/n ranges from 1/n to 1, and this sum can be approximated by the integral from 0 to 1 of arcsin(x) dx, which is π/2 - 1 ≈ 0.5708, but that's not 2/3. Alternatively, if the exponent was 3, like k/n^3, then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^3) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n k/n^3 = (n(n+1)/2)/n^3 ≈ 1/(2n) → 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{1/2}), but then k/n^{1/2} would be up to n^{1/2}, which is large, so arcsin(k/n^{1/2}) is not small. 

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my calculation of the sum of k/n². Let me verify that. The sum from k=1 to n of k is n(n+1)/2. Therefore, sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) = (1 + 1/n)/2. Yes, that's correct. As n→infty, this tends to 1/2. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different approximation for arcsin(x). For example, using the expansion arcsin(x) = x + (x³)/6 + (3x^5)/40 + ... But even then, the higher-order terms vanish as n→infty. So the sum should approach 1/2. 

Given all this, I think the problem statement might have a typo, and the correct answer should be 1/2. However, since the user specified the answer is 2/3, perhaps there's a different approach that I'm missing. Let me try once more.

Wait, another idea: maybe using the integral of arcsin(x) over a different interval. Let me consider the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's make a substitution: let x = k/n². Then, k = x n², and the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x) where x ranges from 1/n² to 1/n. The step size Δx = 1/n². So the sum can be approximated by the integral ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) / Δx dx. Wait, no. In Riemann sums, the sum is approximately ∫_{a}^{b} f(x) dx, where f(x) is evaluated at the points x_k, and Δx = x_{k+1} - x_k. Here, the points are x_k = k/n², and Δx = 1/n². So the Riemann sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k) Δx ≈ ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Therefore, the sum is approximately ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx / Δx. Wait, that would be [integral] / Δx. But Δx = 1/n², and the integral is approximately 1/(2n²) as computed earlier. So [1/(2n²)] / (1/n²) = 1/2. So again, 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe using the average of arcsin(x) over x from 0 to 1/n. The average value would be [1/(1/n)] ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx ≈ n*(1/(2n²)) = 1/(2n). Then multiplying by n terms gives n*(1/(2n)) = 1/2. 

I'm consistently arriving at 1/2, but the problem states 2/3. This suggests that either the problem is incorrect, or there's a different method expected. Maybe I need to consider that arcsin(k/n²) behaves differently when summed over n terms. 

Wait, let's try to compute the sum numerically for a large n. Let's take n=1000. Then, the sum is from k=1 to 1000 of arcsin(k/(1000)^2). For k=1 to 1000, the arguments k/1000000 are from 1e-6 to 1e-3. So arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Therefore, each term is approximately k/1000000 + (k/1000000)^3 /6. The sum of the first terms is sum_{k=1}^{1000} k/1000000 = (1000*1001)/2 / 1000000 = (1001000)/2000000 = 0.5005. The sum of the second terms is sum_{k=1}^{1000} (k^3)/(6*1000^6) = [sum k^3]/(6*1000^6). Sum k^3 from 1 to 1000 is (1000*1001/2)^2 = (500500)^2 = 250500250000. So dividing by 6*1000^6 = 6*1e18, we get 250500250000 / 6e18 ≈ 0.04175. So total sum ≈ 0.5005 + 0.00004175 ≈ 0.50054175, which is approximately 0.5005, close to 1/2. This numerical example supports the analytical result of 1/2.

Therefore, unless there's a mistake in the problem statement, the correct answer should be 1/2. However, since the user mentioned the answer is 2/3, I might have to consider that there's a different interpretation or a typo in the exponent. For instance, if the exponent were 1 instead of 2, like arcsin(k/n), then the sum would be different, but even then, it's not 2/3. Alternatively, if the exponent was something else.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{2}) but with a different approximation. Wait, another idea: perhaps using the expansion arcsin(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (3/40)x^5 + ... and summing the series. Let's compute the sum up to two terms:

sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6] = sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + sum_{k=1}^n (k³)/(6n^6).

We already saw that the first sum is (1 + 1/n)/2, and the second sum is [n²(n+1)^2 /4]/(6n^6) = [1 + 2/n + 1/n²]/(24n²) → 0. So total sum → 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe using the average value of arcsin(x) over the interval. For small x, the average value of arcsin(x) over x from 0 to a is (1/a) ∫_{0}^{a} arcsin(x) dx ≈ (1/a)(x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²)) from 0 to a ≈ (1/a)(a arcsin(a) + sqrt(1 - a²) - 1). For small a, arcsin(a) ≈ a, sqrt(1 - a²) ≈ 1 - a²/2. So this becomes (1/a)(a² + 1 - a²/2 -1) = (1/a)(a²/2) = a/2. Therefore, the average value is approximately a/2. Therefore, the sum over n terms with step Δx = a/n would be n*(average value)*Δx = n*(a/2)*(a/n) = a²/2. But in our case, a = 1/n, so the sum would be (1/n²)/2 = 1/(2n²). Wait, but this contradicts previous results. Maybe this approach is not correct.

Alternatively, considering that each term is approximately k/n², the sum is approximately the sum of k/n² from k=1 to n, which is (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (1 + 1/n)/2 → 1/2.

Given all these different methods and consistent results, I'm confident that the limit is 1/2. Therefore, I suspect that there is either a typo in the problem statement or the provided answer is incorrect. If the problem were to evaluate the limit of the sum of arcsin(k/n), the answer would be different, but as stated, the correct answer should be 1/2.

To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}
\\]

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

Additionally, we verified using integral comparison. The integral \\(\\int_{0}^{n} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{n^2}\\right) \\, dx\\) was evaluated and found to approach \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), confirming our result.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let's start by understanding what's going on here. 

First, arcsin(x) is the inverse sine function, which gives me the angle whose sine is x. But here, the argument inside the arcsin is k/n². Since n is going to infinity, and k ranges from 1 to n, each term in the sum is arcsin(k/n²). Let me see, as n becomes very large, k/n² would be a very small number because k is at most n, so k/n² is at most 1/n, which approaches 0. So maybe I can use the approximation for arcsin(x) when x is near 0. 

I remember that for small x, arcsin(x) can be approximated by x + x³/6 + ..., right? Because the Taylor series expansion of arcsin(x) around 0 is x + (x³)/6 + (3x⁵)/40 + ... So if x is very small, like here, then arcsin(x) ≈ x. Maybe I can approximate each term in the sum by k/n², and then sum those up. 

If I do that, the sum becomes approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k/n². The sum of k from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2, so substituting that in, the approximation would be (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = (1 + 1/n)/2. As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so this approximation gives the limit as 1/2. But wait, the problem mentions the answer is 2/3. Hmm, that contradicts my initial thought. Maybe the approximation isn't sufficient?

Wait, maybe I need to consider higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion. Because even though k/n² is small, when summed over k from 1 to n, the error terms might accumulate. Let me think. The next term in the expansion is (k/n²)³/6. So maybe the total sum can be approximated by the sum of k/n² plus the sum of (k/n²)³/6, and so on. But does the higher-order term contribute to the limit?

Let me compute both the first and the second terms. The first term, as I said, is approximately 1/2. The second term would be (1/6) * sum from k=1 to n of (k/n²)³ = (1/6) * sum k³/n⁶. The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2, so that's approximately n⁴/4 for large n. Therefore, the second term is (1/6) * (n⁴/4)/n⁶ = (1/6) * (1/(4n²)) = 1/(24n²). As n approaches infinity, this term goes to 0. So perhaps the higher-order terms don't affect the limit, and my initial approximation of 1/2 is correct. But the problem states the answer is 2/3. So maybe my approach is missing something.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider integrating instead of summing. Since the sum is from k=1 to n, and each term is a function of k/n², maybe treating this as a Riemann sum. But for a Riemann sum, we usually have terms like f(k/n) * (1/n), but here the argument of arcsin is k/n², which is different. Let me see. If I let x = k/n², then as n becomes large, x ranges from 1/n² to 1/n. So x is between 0 and 1/n, which is getting smaller as n increases. But how does this relate to a Riemann sum?

Alternatively, perhaps I can approximate the sum as an integral. If n is very large, the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by n times the average value of arcsin(x) over x from 0 to 1/n. But that might not be straightforward. Wait, perhaps using the integral approximation for sums. For large n, the sum from k=1 to n of f(k/n²) can be approximated by n² times the integral from 0 to 1 of f(x) dx, but I need to check if that's the case.

Wait, no. Let's recall that for a sum of the form sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kh), it's approximated by (b - a)/n * sum f(a + kh). But here, the argument of the function is k/n², which is like x = k/h where h = n². Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe change variables. Let me set t = k/n², so that when k ranges from 1 to n, t ranges from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. So t is in [0, 1/n]. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(t) where t = k/n². If I approximate the sum as an integral, maybe integrating over t from 0 to 1/n, but the sum steps are in t with step size 1/n². So the sum would be approximately n² * integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(t) dt. But then, as n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the integral is over a vanishing interval. But the integral of arcsin(t) from 0 to x is approximately x + x³/6, so integrating up to 1/n would give (1/n) + (1/n³)/6, so multiplying by n² gives n²*(1/n + 1/(6n³)) = n + 1/(6n) → infinity as n approaches infinity. But that contradicts the earlier approximation. So this approach might not be valid.

Wait, but the original problem is the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum. If the integral approximation gives infinity, which is not the case, so maybe that approach is wrong. Let me check again. If the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), and we approximate each term as k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6 + ..., then sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²) + sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3/6 + ... The first sum is (n(n+1)/2)/n² ≈ (n²/2)/n² = 1/2 as n approaches infinity. The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/n⁶ /6. The sum of k³ is [n(n+1)/2]^2 ≈ n⁴/4, so the second sum is (n⁴/4)/n⁶ /6 = 1/(24n²) → 0. Higher terms would be even smaller. So the total sum is approximately 1/2, so the limit is 1/2. But the problem says the answer is 2/3. Hmm.

Wait, maybe my initial approximation is too crude. Let's consider more precise estimation. Suppose instead of approximating arcsin(x) ≈ x, maybe use a better approximation. For small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So perhaps if we take two terms, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6]. The first part is sum k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² ≈ 1/2. The second part is sum k³/n⁶ /6 ≈ [n⁴/4]/n⁶ /6 = 1/(24n²) → 0. So even adding the next term doesn't change the limit. Therefore, 1/2 is the answer? But the problem states the answer is 2/3. Maybe there's a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is insufficient here. Let's think about the original sum. Each term is arcsin(k/n²). Let me consider the function arcsin(x) for x in [0, 1/n]. The function arcsin(x) is increasing, so we can bound it. For x in [0, 1/n], arcsin(x) ≤ arcsin(1/n). Since 1/n is approaching 0, arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3/6. So each term arcsin(k/n²) ≤ k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6. Then the sum would be ≤ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)] = [n(n+1)/2]/n² + [n²(n+1)^2 /4]/(6n⁶). The first term is approximately 1/2, the second term is approximately [n⁴/4]/(6n⁶) = 1/(24n²) → 0. Similarly, a lower bound would be similar. So the sum is squeezed between 1/2 and 1/2 + o(1), so the limit should be 1/2. But the problem says 2/3. Wait, this is confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly? Let me check. The user wrote: Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) and then some fraction 2/3. Maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I need to use a different approach. Let's consider the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me make a substitution. Let x = k/n², so that k = x n². Then, as n becomes large, x ranges from 1/n² to 1/n. So x is between 0 and 1/n, which is approaching 0. The sum can be approximated by an integral. But how?

Wait, the sum S_n is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me consider that for large n, the step between consecutive terms is Δx = (k+1)/n² - k/n² = 1/n². So the sum can be approximated by the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) dx, multiplied by n². But wait, the step size is 1/n², and the number of terms is n. So the sum is approximately n² * integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx. Let's compute that integral.

Compute integral from 0 to a of arcsin(x) dx, where a = 1/n. Integration by parts: let u = arcsin(x), dv = dx. Then du = 1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, v = x. So integral = x arcsin(x) - integral x / sqrt(1 - x²) dx. The integral of x / sqrt(1 - x²) dx is -sqrt(1 - x²). So the integral from 0 to a is [x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²)] from 0 to a. Evaluating at a: a arcsin(a) + sqrt(1 - a²). At 0: 0 + 1. So the integral is a arcsin(a) + sqrt(1 - a²) - 1.

Therefore, the sum S_n ≈ n² [a arcsin(a) + sqrt(1 - a²) - 1], where a = 1/n. Let's substitute a = 1/n:

S_n ≈ n² [ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2) - 1 ].

Now, let's expand each term for large n. First, arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3 /6. So:

(1/n) arcsin(1/n) ≈ (1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³)) = 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴).

Next, sqrt(1 - 1/n²) = sqrt((n² -1)/n²) = sqrt(n² -1)/n ≈ (n - 1/(2n)) /n = 1 - 1/(2n²) for large n.

So sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ≈ -1/(2n²).

Putting it all together:

S_n ≈ n² [1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) - 1/(2n²)] = n² [ -1/(2n²) + 1/(6n⁴) + 1/n² ].

Wait, hold on. Let me recheck the terms:

First term: (1/n²) from (1/n) arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴).

Second term: sqrt(1 - 1/n²) -1 ≈ -1/(2n²).

So combining:

n² [ (1/n² + 1/(6n⁴)) + (-1/(2n²)) ] = n² [ -1/(2n²) + 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) ] = n² [ 1/(2n²) + 1/(6n⁴) ] = 1/2 + 1/(6n²).

As n approaches infinity, the 1/(6n²) term goes to 0, so S_n ≈ 1/2. Hmm, so again, the limit is 1/2. But the problem says 2/3. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the integral approximation is not the right approach. Let me try another method. Let's use the mean value theorem for sums. For each term arcsin(k/n²), since arcsin is increasing, there exists some c_k between 0 and k/n² such that arcsin(k/n²) = k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + ... But this is similar to the Taylor series approach.

Alternatively, consider the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² for small k/n². But when k is up to n, k/n² is up to 1/n, which is approaching 0. So the approximation should be valid. Then sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (1/n²) * n(n + 1)/2 ≈ (n² + n)/2n² ≈ (1 + 1/n)/2 → 1/2 as n → ∞.

But the answer is supposed to be 2/3? Maybe the problem is different? Wait, let me check the problem again. The user wrote: Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) and then wrote \\frac{2}{3}$ without any LaTeX. Maybe the problem is actually lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = 2/3? But according to my calculations, it's 1/2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe there is a mistake in my reasoning. Let's check with specific values. For example, take n=1. Then the sum is arcsin(1/1²) = arcsin(1) = π/2 ≈ 1.5708. For n=2, the sum is arcsin(1/4) + arcsin(2/4) ≈ arcsin(0.25) + arcsin(0.5) ≈ 0.2527 + 0.5236 ≈ 0.7763. For n=3, sum is arcsin(1/9) + arcsin(2/9) + arcsin(3/9) ≈ 0.1112 + 0.2224 + 0.3336 ≈ 0.6672. For n=10, let's approximate sum_{k=1}^{10} arcsin(k/100). Since k/100 is from 0.01 to 0.1. Using arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. So sum ≈ sum_{k=1}^{10} [k/100 + (k/100)^3 /6]. Compute sum k/100 = (10*11)/2 /100 = 55/100 = 0.55. Sum (k³)/6*1000000 = sum k³ /6000000. Sum of k³ from 1 to 10 is (10*11/2)^2 = 3025. So sum k³ /6000000 = 3025 /6000000 ≈ 0.00050417. So total sum ≈ 0.55 + 0.00050417 ≈ 0.5505. For n=10, it's approximately 0.55, which is close to 1/2 (0.5). For larger n, say n=1000, the sum would be approximately (1/2 + 1/(2n)) which approaches 1/2. So the limit should be 1/2.

But the problem says 2/3. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps I made a mistake in my approximations.

Wait, another approach: Let's use the identity that for small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So if we take the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + ...]. The first term sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² ≈ (n²/2)/n² = 1/2. The second term sum_{k=1}^n (k³)/6n⁶ ≈ [n⁴/4]/6n⁶ = 1/(24n²) → 0. Higher terms will be even smaller. So the total sum is 1/2 + o(1). Therefore, the limit is 1/2. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n) instead of k/n²? If it were k/n, then the sum would behave differently. Let's check that. If it were arcsin(k/n), then for large n, k/n ranges from 0 to 1, and the sum would be approximated by n * average of arcsin(x) over x from 0 to 1. The average value of arcsin(x) from 0 to 1 is integral from 0 to 1 of arcsin(x) dx. Let's compute that. As before, integral arcsin(x) dx = x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²) from 0 to 1. At x=1: 1*(π/2) + 0 = π/2. At x=0: 0 + 1. So integral is π/2 - 1 ≈ 0.5708. Then the average value is (π/2 - 1)/1 ≈ 0.5708, so the sum would be approximately n * 0.5708, which goes to infinity. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) but with a different exponent. If it were k/n³, then the sum would be different. But according to the problem statement, it's k/n². 

Wait, let me check the problem again. The user wrote: ""Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) \\frac{2}{3}"". Maybe the fraction is part of the problem? Or perhaps a typo. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation in the problem's expected answer. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different approximation. For example, using the fact that arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 + x^5/40 + ..., but integrating term-wise. Wait, but we already did that.

Alternatively, consider the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me make the substitution m = n², so that k/m = k/n². Then as n approaches infinity, m approaches infinity as well, but k ranges from 1 to sqrt(m). Wait, not sure. Alternatively, consider n as a large parameter, and approximate the sum as an integral. Let's let x = k/n², then k = x n², and dk = n² dx. The sum becomes approximately integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) n² dx. Wait, that's similar to the previous approach. So the integral would be n² * integral from 0 to 1/n arcsin(x) dx. Which we computed earlier as n² [ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2) - 1 ] ≈ n² [ (1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³)) + (1 - 1/(2n²)) -1 ] = n² [ 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) -1/(2n²) ] = n² [ -1/(2n²) + 1/(6n⁴) + 1/n² ] = n² [ 1/(2n²) + 1/(6n⁴) ] = 1/2 + 1/(6n²) → 1/2 as n→infty.

Therefore, the limit is 1/2, but the problem states 2/3. There must be a mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n) instead of k/n². Let me check that. If it were k/n, then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n). For large n, this would be approximated by n times the average of arcsin(x) over x from 0 to 1. The average is integral from 0 to 1 arcsin(x) dx ≈ 0.5708, so the sum would be approximately 0.5708 n, which goes to infinity. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n? Then the limit would be 1/2 * n, which would go to infinity. But the problem doesn't state that. 

Alternatively, maybe there is an error in the problem statement, and the correct answer is indeed 1/2. But the user provided the answer 2/3. Maybe the problem was supposed to be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n) instead of k/n². Let me compute that. If the problem were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), then for large n, k/n ranges from 0 to 1. The sum would be approximately n times the average of arcsin(x) over [0,1], which is (π/2 -1) as computed before. But (π/2 -1) is approximately 0.5708, so the sum would be approximately 0.5708 n, which tends to infinity. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/(n))^(1/2). Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(1/n²). But that would be n arcsin(1/n²) ≈ n*(1/n² + 1/(6n^6)) ≈ 1/n + 1/(6n^5) → 0. Not the case.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k)/n². Then it would be (1/n²) sum arcsin(k), but sum arcsin(k) from k=1 to n is large, but divided by n², it would go to 0. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n. Then the limit would be n*(1/2) → infinity. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different approximation. Let's try expanding arcsin(k/n²) using the Taylor series up to higher terms and see if that helps. 

arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... 

So sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + 3(k/n²)^5 /40 + ...]

= sum k/n² + sum (k³)/6n⁶ + sum 3k⁵/40n^{10} + ...

First term: sum k/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² ≈ (n² + n)/2n² ≈ 1/2 + 1/(2n) → 1/2.

Second term: sum k³ /6n⁶ = [n²(n+1)^2 /4]/6n⁶ ≈ (n⁴)/24n⁶ = 1/(24n²) → 0.

Third term: sum 3k⁵ /40n^{10} = 3/(40n^{10}) sum k⁵. Sum k⁵ ≈ n⁶/6, so term ≈ 3/(40n^{10})*(n⁶/6) = 3/(240n⁴) → 0.

So higher terms vanish. Therefore, the total sum is 1/2 + o(1). Therefore, the limit is 1/2. Hence, the answer should be 1/2, but the problem states 2/3. This is conflicting.

Wait, maybe the problem is mistyped. Let me check the original problem again. The user wrote: ""Evaluate the limit: \\[ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\]\\frac{2}{3}$"". The LaTeX code seems to have an extra \\frac{2}{3} at the end, which might be a formatting error. Perhaps the problem was intended to have a different exponent or a different function. Alternatively, maybe the problem is from a source where the answer is 2/3, but according to my calculations, it's 1/2. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is correct, and I'm missing a step. Let me try another approach. Suppose I use the inequality arcsin(x) ≥ x for x in [0, π/2]. Since k/n² is in [0, 1/n], which is within [0, π/2] for large n. Therefore, arcsin(k/n²) ≥ k/n². Similarly, using the inequality arcsin(x) ≤ x + x³/6. So, k/n² ≤ arcsin(k/n²) ≤ k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6. Then, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) is between sum_{k=1}^n k/n² and sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)]. As previously calculated, the lower bound approaches 1/2, and the upper bound approaches 1/2. Therefore, by the squeeze theorem, the limit is 1/2. 

Therefore, unless there's a mistake in the problem statement, the answer should be 1/2. But the user mentioned the answer is 2/3, which suggests a possible error. Alternatively, perhaps the problem was supposed to be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n? Then the limit would be n*(1/2) → infinity. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n². Then, the limit would be n²*(1/2) → infinity. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) divided by n. Then the limit would be (1/2)/n → 0. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is different. Suppose the sum is from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²), but with a different exponent. For example, if it were arcsin(k/n^3), then the sum would behave differently. Let's check. If it's k/n³, then arcsin(k/n³) ≈ k/n³ + (k/n³)^3 /6. Sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n³) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n k/n³ = (1/n³)(n(n+1)/2) ≈ (n²)/2n³ = 1/(2n) → 0. So limit is 0. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(n/k²). But that's a different expression. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(1/(n² -k²)). But that complicates things. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and my calculations are wrong. Let me check with n approaching infinity. Let's consider the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's approximate the sum by an integral. Let x = k/n², so that k = x n². Then, dk = n² dx. The sum can be approximated by the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) n² dx. Which is n² ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. As before, ∫ arcsin(x) dx = x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²). Evaluated from 0 to 1/n: (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2) - 1. Then multiply by n²: n² [ (1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³)) + (1 - 1/(2n²)) -1 ] = n² [ 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) -1/(2n²) ] = n² [ -1/(2n²) + 1/(6n⁴) + 1/n² ] = n² [ 1/(2n²) + 1/(6n⁴) ] = 1/2 + 1/(6n²) → 1/2. So again, the limit is 1/2. 

Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation I haven't caught, the answer should be 1/2. The problem's mention of 2/3 might be incorrect, or perhaps there's a typo in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was different, such as summing arcsin(k/n) instead of arcsin(k/n²), in which case the answer would be different. For example, if it were arcsin(k/n), then the sum would be approximately n*(average of arcsin(x) over [0,1]) which is n*(π/2 -1) as computed before, but that's for the average over [0,1], and the sum would be approximately n*(π/2 -1) which grows without bound, so the limit would be infinity. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(sqrt(k/n²)) or something else. But without further information, it's hard to tell. 

Given the problem as stated, the limit is 1/2. Therefore, unless there's a mistake in my analysis, the answer should be \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}.

To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}
\\]

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

Additionally, we verified using integral comparison. The integral \\(\\int_{0}^{n} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{n^2}\\right) \\, dx\\) was evaluated and found to approach \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), confirming our result.

Thus, the limit is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let's start by understanding what's going on here. 

First, the function inside the sum is arcsin(k/n²). Since we're dealing with a limit as n goes to infinity, I should think about how k/n² behaves. For each term in the sum, k ranges from 1 to n, so the argument of arcsin is k/n². When n is large, k is much smaller than n² because the maximum value of k is n, and n is much smaller than n². So, for large n, the argument of arcsin, which is k/n², is going to be a small positive number because k is up to n and n² is much larger. 

Now, I remember that for small x, arcsin(x) can be approximated by x + x³/6 + ... using the Taylor series expansion. Since the argument here is small (because k/n² is small for large n), maybe I can approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n². If that's the case, then the sum becomes approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k/n². Let's check if that's valid.

So, approximating arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n². Then the sum would be (1/n²) * sum_{k=1}^n k. The sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2, so substituting that in, we get (1/n²)*(n(n+1)/2) = (n+1)/(2n). As n approaches infinity, (n+1)/(2n) approaches 1/2. So, if the approximation holds, the limit would be 1/2. But wait, the problem states that the limit is 2/3. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, maybe the approximation isn't sufficient. Let me double-check. The Taylor series for arcsin(x) around 0 is x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, if I approximate arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6, then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)³/6]. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶). Let's compute both parts.

First part: sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2 as n→infty.

Second part: sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶). The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2. So, substituting, we get [n²(n+1)²/4]/(6n⁶) = (n²(n+1)²)/(24n⁶) = (n²(n² + 2n + 1))/(24n⁶) = (n⁴ + 2n³ + n²)/(24n⁶) ≈ (n⁴)/(24n⁶) = 1/(24n²) as n→infty. So, the second part tends to zero as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the corrected approximation gives the sum approaching 1/2 + 0 = 1/2. But the problem states that the limit is 2/3. Hmm, contradiction here. So, my initial approach must be missing something.

Wait, maybe the arcsin approximation isn't good enough here. Let me think. When k is up to n, the maximum argument of arcsin is n/n² = 1/n, which still tends to zero as n→infty. So, all terms in the sum are arcsin of a small x, so the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 should be valid. But according to that, the limit is 1/2, but the problem says 2/3. So, maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps converting the sum into an integral. Since the sum is from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²), if we let x = k/n², then when n is large, the sum can be approximated by an integral. Let's try that.

The sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me set x_k = k/n². Then, the step between consecutive x's is Δx = 1/n². So, the sum can be approximated by the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) dx. Wait, but as n→infty, the upper limit of the integral would be x=1/n, which approaches zero. However, this seems counterintuitive because the sum is from k=1 to n, so x ranges from 1/n² up to n/n² = 1/n. But integrating from 0 to 1/n might not capture the entire sum. Wait, maybe I need to adjust the approximation.

Alternatively, perhaps using a Riemann sum. The sum (1/n) sum_{k=1}^n f(k/n) approximates the integral of f(x) from 0 to 1. But here, the sum isn't scaled by 1/n. Wait, our sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me see. Let me try to write it as a Riemann sum by scaling appropriately.

Let me set t = k/n. Then, k = tn, and as k goes from 1 to n, t goes from 1/n to 1. Then, k/n² = (tn)/n² = t/n. So, arcsin(k/n²) = arcsin(t/n). Then, the sum becomes sum_{t=1/n}^{1} arcsin(t/n) * Δt, where Δt = 1/n. So, the sum is approximately the integral from t=0 to t=1 of arcsin(t/n) dt. But as n→infty, t/n becomes t/n → 0, so arcsin(t/n) ≈ t/n. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (t/n) dt = [t²/(2n)]₀¹ = 1/(2n). But then, the sum is approximately 1/(2n), which tends to zero as n→infty. But this contradicts the earlier result. Hmm, something is wrong here. Maybe my substitution is off.

Wait, perhaps another way. Let me consider the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me make a substitution. Let x = k/n², so k = n² x. Then, as k goes from 1 to n, x goes from 1/n² to 1/n. The step in x is Δx = 1/n². So, the sum can be approximated as the integral from x=1/n² to x=1/n of arcsin(x)/Δx dx. Wait, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe use the integral approximation for sums.

The sum sum_{k=1}^n f(k) can be approximated by ∫_{1}^{n} f(k) dk, but in our case, the variable is k, and the function is arcsin(k/n²). Alternatively, maybe use a substitution.

Alternatively, let me consider the following: For each term in the sum, arcsin(k/n²). Let me make a substitution: Let x = k/n², so k = n² x. Then, the sum becomes sum_{x=1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(x). But the sum is over k from 1 to n, so x varies from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. The step in x is 1/n². So, the sum is approximately the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) dx. But as n→infty, the upper limit is 1/n →0. So, the integral becomes ∫₀⁰ arcsin(x) dx =0. But this can't be right, since the sum is actually positive. So, this approach isn't working. Maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps the approximation arcsin(x) ≈x is not sufficient here because even though each term is small, when summed over n terms, the total error might not vanish. Let me check the error in the approximation.

The Taylor series for arcsin(x) is x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, the error after the first term is approximately x³/6. So, the error in each term is O((k/n²)^3). Therefore, the total error in the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3 = (1/n⁶) sum_{k=1}^n k³. The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2 ≈ n⁴/4. Therefore, the total error is (n⁴/4)/n⁶ = 1/(4n²), which tends to zero as n→infty. So, the main term is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² ≈ 1/2. So, according to this, the limit should be 1/2, but the problem states 2/3. So, there must be a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the initial approximation is missing something. Let me think again. Perhaps integrating arcsin(x) from 0 to 1/n² and then multiplying by n, but I'm getting confused. Alternatively, maybe using a different approximation for the sum.

Alternatively, consider that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈x + x³/6. Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6]. The first sum is (n+1)/2n ≈1/2, and the second sum is sum_{k=1}^n (k³)/(6n⁶) = [n²(n+1)²/4]/(6n⁶) = [n⁴ + 2n³ + n²]/(24n⁶) ≈1/(24n²). So, as n→infty, the second term goes to zero. So, total sum approaches 1/2. Still, the problem says the limit is 2/3. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the approximation arcsin(x) ≈x is too crude here. Let me check with another method. Let's use the integral test or compare the sum to an integral.

Consider that the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me consider the function f(k) = arcsin(k/n²). Then, the sum can be approximated by the integral from k=1 to k=n of f(k) dk. But integrating arcsin(k/n²) with respect to k. Let me make substitution: let x = k/n², so k = n² x, dk = n² dx. Then, the integral becomes ∫_{x=1/n²}^{x=1/n} arcsin(x) * n² dx. Then, the integral is n² ∫_{1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. As n→infty, the limits of integration go from 0 to 0, so the integral is n² * [arcsin(x) * x - ∫ x dx / sqrt(1 - x²)} ] from 0 to 0? Wait, integrating arcsin(x) dx. The integral of arcsin(x) dx is x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²) + C. Wait, let's compute the integral:

∫ arcsin(x) dx = x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²) + C.

Therefore, ∫_{a}^{b} arcsin(x) dx = [x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²)]_{a}^{b}.

Therefore, the integral from 1/n² to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx is [ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2) - (1/n²) arcsin(1/n²) - sqrt(1 - (1/n²)^2) ].

But as n→infty, arcsin(1/n) ≈1/n + (1/n)^3/6, and arcsin(1/n²) ≈1/n² + (1/n²)^3/6. Therefore, the first term is approximately (1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³)) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - (1/n²)(1/n² + 1/(6n⁶)) - sqrt(1 - 1/n⁴).

Simplify term by term:

First part: (1/n)(1/n) = 1/n², and (1/n)(1/(6n³)) = 1/(6n⁴).

Second part: sqrt(1 - 1/n²) ≈1 - (1/(2n²)) using Taylor series sqrt(1 - x) ≈1 - x/2 for small x.

Third part: -(1/n²)(1/n²) = -1/n⁴, and -(1/n²)(1/(6n⁶)) = -1/(6n⁸).

Fourth part: -sqrt(1 - 1/n⁴) ≈ -1 + (1/(2n⁴)).

Putting it all together:

1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) + [1 - 1/(2n²)] -1/n⁴ -1/(6n⁸) - [1 - 1/(2n⁴)].

Simplify:

1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) +1 -1/(2n²) -1/n⁴ -1/(6n⁸) -1 +1/(2n⁴).

Combine like terms:

1/n² -1/(2n²) = (-1)/(2n²).

1/(6n⁴) -1/n⁴ +1/(2n⁴) = [1/6 -1 +1/2]/n⁴ = (-1/3)/n⁴.

Other terms: -1/(6n⁸) and negligible.

So, total integral ≈ -1/(2n²) -1/(3n⁴) -1/(6n⁸). Multiply by n² (from the earlier substitution):

n² * [ -1/(2n²) -1/(3n⁴) -1/(6n⁸) ] ≈ -1/2 -1/(3n²) -1/(6n⁶). As n→infty, this approaches -1/2. But the integral was supposed to represent the sum, but the sum is positive. However, the integral approximation gave us a negative value? That can't be right. So, there must be a mistake in the sign somewhere.

Wait, let's check the integral again. The integral of arcsin(x) from a to b is [x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 -x²)] from a to b. So, the expression is [b arcsin(b) + sqrt(1 -b²)] - [a arcsin(a) + sqrt(1 -a²)]. Therefore, in our case, a=1/n² and b=1/n. Therefore, the integral is:

[ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2) ] - [ (1/n²) arcsin(1/n²) + sqrt(1 - (1/n²)^2) ].

But when expanding, the terms from sqrt(1 -x²) are:

sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2) ≈1 - 1/(2n²),

sqrt(1 - (1/n²)^2) ≈1 - 1/(2n⁴).

So, the integral becomes:

(1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³)) + (1 - 1/(2n²)) - (1/n²)(1/n² + 1/(6n⁶)) - (1 - 1/(2n⁴)).

Expanding this:

(1/n² + 1/(6n⁴)) +1 -1/(2n²) - (1/n⁴ + 1/(6n⁸)) -1 +1/(2n⁴).

Combine terms:

1/n² -1/(2n²) = -1/(2n²).

1/(6n⁴) -1/n⁴ +1/(2n⁴) = (-1/3)/n⁴.

The rest: -1/(6n⁸) and other negligible terms.

Therefore, the integral is approximately -1/(2n²) -1/(3n⁴) -1/(6n⁸). Multiply by n² gives:

-1/2 -1/(3n²) -1/(6n⁶). So, as n→infty, the integral approaches -1/2. But the sum is positive. So, this suggests that the integral approximation isn't capturing the sum correctly. Maybe because the function arcsin(x) is being integrated over a tiny interval, and the approximation isn't valid? Or perhaps the substitution approach isn't correct here.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different approximation. Let me think again. If I have the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me consider that each term is arcsin(k/n²). Let me use the approximation arcsin(x) ≈x + x³/6 + x⁵/40 + ... for small x. So, each term is approximately k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6 + ... Then, the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶) + ...]. The first sum is (n(n+1)/2)/n² ≈1/2 as n→infty. The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [n²(n+1)²/4]/(6n⁶) ≈1/(24n²) →0. So, again, the sum approaches 1/2. But the problem states that the limit is 2/3. So, there's a conflict here.

Wait, maybe the problem is written incorrectly? Or maybe I misread it. Let me check again. The problem says: Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). The user then writes ""the limit is 2/3"". So, the correct answer should be 2/3, but according to my approximations, it's approaching 1/2. So, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe my approach is missing something.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different method. Let me try to use the integral test or compare the sum to an integral. The sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's consider the function f(x) = arcsin(x/n²) for x in [1, n]. Then, the sum is the sum of f(k) for k=1 to n. If we approximate the sum by the integral of f(x) from 1 to n, then:

Sum ≈ ∫₁ⁿ arcsin(x/n²) dx.

Let me compute this integral. Let me make substitution: let t = x/n², so x = n² t, dx = n² dt. The limits of integration become t = 1/n² to t = 1/n. So, the integral becomes ∫_{1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(t) * n² dt. As n→infty, the limits go from 0 to 0. Expanding arcsin(t) ≈ t + t³/6, then:

Integral ≈ n² ∫_{1/n²}^{1/n} (t + t³/6) dt = n² [ (t²/2 + t⁴/24) ] from 1/n² to 1/n.

Compute at upper limit 1/n:

t²/2 = (1/n²)/2 = 1/(2n²),

t⁴/24 = (1/n⁴)/24 = 1/(24n⁴).

At lower limit 1/n²:

t²/2 = (1/n⁴)/2 = 1/(2n⁴),

t⁴/24 = (1/n⁸)/24 = 1/(24n⁸).

Therefore, the integral is approximately:

n² [ (1/(2n²) + 1/(24n⁴)) - (1/(2n⁴) + 1/(24n⁸)) ] = n² [ 1/(2n²) +1/(24n⁴) -1/(2n⁴) -1/(24n⁸) ].

Simplify term by term:

n² * 1/(2n²) = 1/2,

n² *1/(24n⁴) =1/(24n²),

n² * -1/(2n⁴) = -1/(2n²),

n² * -1/(24n⁸) = -1/(24n⁶).

So, total integral ≈1/2 +1/(24n²) -1/(2n²) -1/(24n⁶) =1/2 -1/(12n²) -1/(24n⁶). As n→infty, this approaches 1/2. So, the integral approximation gives 1/2, which matches the earlier sum approximation. But the problem states 2/3. So, either the problem is wrong, or there's a different approach.

Wait, maybe I need to consider a better approximation for arcsin(k/n²). Let me recall that for small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... Maybe considering higher-order terms? Let's try including the x³ term.

So, arcsin(k/n²) ≈k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6. Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)]. The first sum is (n(n+1)/2)/n² ≈1/2. The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [n²(n+1)²/4]/(6n⁶) ≈1/(24n²). So, total sum is approximately1/2 +1/(24n²) →1/2 as n→infty.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is supposed to be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n). Then, the limit would be different. Let me check. If the argument were k/n instead of k/n², then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n). Then, using the approximation arcsin(x) ≈x for small x, but when k/n approaches 1 as k→n, the approximation breaks down. However, for the sum up to k=n, the terms near k=n would have arcsin(1 -1/n) ≈π/2 - sqrt(2n -1)/n, but integrating that would be complicated. However, that's not the problem here.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement and the correct limit is 1/2, but the user mentioned 2/3. Alternatively, maybe using a different method.

Wait, let me try to use the approximation arcsin(x) ≈x + x³/6 for each term and compute the sum:

Sum = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6] = (1/n²) sum_{k=1}^n k + (1/(6n⁶)) sum_{k=1}^n k³.

Compute both sums:

sum_{k=1}^n k = n(n+1)/2 ≈n²/2,

sum_{k=1}^n k³ = [n(n+1)/2]^2 ≈n⁴/4.

Therefore,

Sum ≈ (1/n²)(n²/2) + (1/(6n⁶))(n⁴/4) =1/2 + (1/(24n²)) →1/2 as n→infty.

So, again, the same result. It seems that the limit should be 1/2, but the problem states 2/3. This suggests either a mistake in the problem or perhaps a different approach is required.

Alternatively, maybe using the mean value theorem for integrals or another method. Let me think.

Suppose I consider the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me denote k/n² = x_k. Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k). If I consider x_k = k/n², then x_k increases from 1/n² to 1/n. The number of terms is n, and the step between consecutive x_k is Δx =1/n². So, the sum can be approximated by the integral ∫_{x=1/n²}^{x=1/n} arcsin(x)/Δx dx. Wait, no, the sum is sum arcsin(x_k) ≈ ∫ arcsin(x) dx / Δx, but this might not be correct.

Alternatively, perhaps using the trapezoidal rule or another quadrature formula. But this seems too vague.

Wait, maybe the problem is correct and the answer is 2/3. Let me check with n=1: sum_{k=1}^1 arcsin(1/1²)=arcsin(1)=π/2≈1.5708. For n=2: sum_{k=1}^2 arcsin(k/4)=arcsin(1/4)+arcsin(2/4)=arcsin(0.25)+arcsin(0.5)≈0.2527 +0.5236≈0.7763. For n=3: sum_{k=1}^3 arcsin(k/9)=arcsin(1/9)+arcsin(2/9)+arcsin(3/9)≈0.1104+0.2211+0.3398≈0.6713. For n=10: sum_{k=1}^10 arcsin(k/100). Each term is arcsin(k/100). For k=1:≈0.0100, k=2:≈0.0200, ..., k=10:≈0.1000. The sum would be approximately sum_{k=1}^{10} (k/100 + (k/100)^3/6) ≈ sum_{k=1}^{10} (k/100 +k³/(6*10^6)) ≈ (55/100) + (10^4/(6*10^6)) ≈0.55 +0.001666≈0.5517. Which is close to 0.5. For n=100, the sum would be approximately sum_{k=1}^{100} (k/10000 +k³/(6*10^{12})) ≈ (5050/10000) + (10^6/(6*10^{12})) ≈0.505 +0.000000166≈0.505. So, approaching 0.5. So, numerical calculations support the 1/2 limit.

Therefore, it's possible that the problem statement has a typo and the correct limit is 1/2, not 2/3. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), and that limit is different. Let's check that quickly. If the problem were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), then for large n, each term arcsin(k/n) ≈k/n, sum≈(n(n+1)/2)/n≈(n+1)/2≈n/2, which tends to infinity. But that's not 2/3. Alternatively, maybe sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n? Then, n*sum≈n*(1/2)=n/2→infty. No.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n)/n. Then, sum≈sum_{k=1}^n (k/n)/n = sum_{k=1}^n k/n²≈1/2. Still 1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a different exponent. For example, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{3/2}). Then, k/n^{3/2} is smaller, and the sum would be different. But without more information, it's hard to say.

Given that according to multiple methods (approximating the sum by an integral, expanding arcsin in Taylor series, numerical examples), the limit seems to be 1/2, I suspect that there might be an error in the problem statement. However, since the user mentions that the limit is 2/3, maybe I missed something.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let me consider the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me use the identity arcsin(x) = ∫₀^x 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n ∫₀^{k/n²} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Interchanging sum and integral (if possible), we get ∫₀^{1/n} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) * (number of terms where t <= k/n²) dt. For t in [0, 1/n], k/n² >= t implies k >= tn². Since k ranges from 1 to n, tn² <=n => t <=1/n. So, for t in [0,1/n], the number of terms is floor(n² t). But this seems complicated. Alternatively, approximate the number of terms as n² t. So, the sum is approximately ∫₀^{1/n} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) *n² t dt. Let's compute this integral:

n² ∫₀^{1/n} t / sqrt(1 - t²) dt.

Let me make substitution u = sqrt(1 - t²), du = -t/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Then, the integral becomes n² ∫_{u=1}^{u=sqrt(1 -1/n²)} (-du) = n² [sqrt(1 -1/n²) -1]. So, the integral is n² [sqrt(1 -1/n²) -1]. As n→infty, sqrt(1 -1/n²) ≈1 -1/(2n²). So, the expression becomes n² [1 -1/(2n²) -1] =n² [-1/(2n²)] = -1/2. But the sum was positive, so this contradicts. Therefore, this approach must be flawed.

Alternatively, perhaps the interchange of sum and integral isn't valid here. So, this method isn't helpful.

Another idea: Maybe using the average value of arcsin(k/n²). The sum is n times the average of arcsin(k/n²). If we model k/n² as a continuous variable x, then x ranges from 1/n² to 1/n. The average value would be approximately the average of arcsin(x) over x from 0 to 1/n. But this seems similar to previous approaches.

Alternatively, using the mean value theorem for sums. The sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by n * arcsin( (1+2+...+n)/(n²) ) =n * arcsin( n(n+1)/(2n²) ) =n * arcsin( (n+1)/(2n) ) ≈n * arcsin(1/2 +1/(2n)) ≈n*(π/6 + (1/(2n)) ). So, this gives n*(π/6 +1/(2n)) =nπ/6 +1/2. As n→infty, this tends to infinity, which contradicts previous results. But this is a heuristic approach and likely incorrect.

Wait, why did I use the mean value theorem here? The mean value theorem for sums states that there exists some c in [1,n] such that sum_{k=1}^n f(k) =n f(c). But this is only valid if the function is monotonic. However, arcsin(k/n²) is increasing with k, so maybe applying the theorem as:

sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) =n arcsin(c/n²), where c is some constant in [1,n]. But then, c/n² is between 1/n² and 1/n. As n→infty, c/n²→0, so arcsin(c/n²)≈c/n². Then, sum≈n*(c/n²)=c/n→0. But this contradicts previous results. So, the mean value theorem approach isn't helpful here.

Alternatively, maybe using the Euler-Maclaurin formula to approximate the sum. The Euler-Maclaurin formula relates sums to integrals and correction terms. But this might be too involved for this problem.

Given that multiple methods lead to the conclusion that the limit is 1/2, and the problem states the limit is 2/3, I suspect there might be a mistake in the problem statement. However, assuming the problem is correct and I need to find 2/3, perhaps there's a different approach.

Wait, let me try to use the approximation arcsin(x) ≈x +x³/6 +x⁵/40. Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² +k³/(6n⁶) +k⁵/(40n^{10})]. The first two terms give approximately1/2 +1/(24n²), and the third term is negligible. Still, approaching1/2.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) *n. Then, the limit would be n*1/2→infty. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem was sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{3/2}), then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{3/2}) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n k/n^{3/2} = (n(n+1)/2)/n^{3/2} ≈n^{1/2}/2→infty. No.

Alternatively, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n³). Then, each term is arcsin(k/n³)≈k/n³, sum≈(n(n+1)/2)/n³≈1/(2n)→0.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{1/2}), but that's speculative.

Given all these attempts, I'm consistently getting 1/2, but the problem states 2/3. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation on my part, which I've checked multiple times, I believe the correct answer is 1/2. It's possible that the original problem had a different exponent or a different function.

However, since the user has indicated that the limit is 2/3, perhaps there's a different approach or a specific method required. Let me try once more.

Consider the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6. Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² +k³/(6n⁶)]. The first sum is (n+1)/2n ≈1/2. The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [n²(n+1)²/4]/(6n⁶) ≈1/(24n²). So, total sum≈1/2 +1/(24n²)→1/2.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n. Then, limit would be n*(1/2)→infty. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had k² instead of k. For example, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k²/n²). Then, sum≈sum_{k=1}^n k²/n²≈(n(n+1)(2n+1)/6)/n²≈(2n² +3n +1)/6n≈(2n +3 +1/n)/6→infty. No.

Alternatively, maybe a different function inside the arcsin. For example, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n². Then, sum≈n²*1/2→infty. No.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n³. Then, sum≈n³*1/2→infty.

Given all these possibilities, I'm confident that the original problem's limit is 1/2, and there might be a typo in the problem statement. However, since the user insists the limit is 2/3, perhaps I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, let me consider that when approximating the sum by an integral, perhaps I need to consider a different scaling. Suppose I let m = n², then k ranges from 1 to m^{1/2}. But this seems unclear.

Alternatively, use the fact that sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin( (k/n)/n ). Let x =k/n, then x ranges from 1/n to1. So, arcsin( x/n ). Then, the sum becomes sum_{x=1/n}^{1} arcsin(x/n). The step in x is Δx =1/n. So, the sum is approximately the integral from x=0 to x=1 of arcsin(x/n) dx. As n→infty, arcsin(x/n)≈x/n. Therefore, the integral is ∫₀¹ (x/n) dx =1/(2n). But this contradicts previous results. Wait, this suggests the sum is approximately1/(2n)→0, but that's not possible because each term is positive and there are n terms, so the sum should be at least n*arcsin(1/n²)≈n*(1/n²)=1/n→0. But this is inconsistent.

Wait, this is confusing. On one hand, approximating each term as k/n² gives the sum approaching1/2, but approximating the sum as an integral here gives approaching0. Which is correct?

Let me take n=1000. Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^{1000} arcsin(k/1000000). Each term is approximatelyk/1000000. So, the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^{1000} k/1000000 = (1000*1001)/2 /1000000≈500.5/1000≈0.5005. Which is close to0.5. Therefore, the approximation of the sum as1/2 is correct for large n. Therefore, the integral approach must be flawed.

Therefore, I conclude that the limit is1/2, and there might be an error in the problem statement. However, since the user provided the answer as2/3, perhaps they used a different method or there's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the approximation arcsin(x) ≈x +x³/6 and sum_{k=1}^n x_k ≈1/2 and sum_{k=1}^n x_k³≈1/(3n²), but I don't see how that gives2/3.

Wait, let's try to compute the sum more accurately. Let's take the approximation arcsin(x) ≈x +x³/6. Then, the sum is:

Sum = sum_{k=1}^n (k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6) = (1/n²) sum_{k=1}^n k + (1/(6n⁶)) sum_{k=1}^n k³.

Compute the sums:

sum_{k=1}^n k =n(n+1)/2≈n²/2,

sum_{k=1}^n k³ = [n(n+1)/2]^2≈n⁴/4.

Therefore,

Sum≈(1/n²)(n²/2) + (1/(6n⁶))(n⁴/4) =1/2 +1/(24n²)→1/2.

Still, the same result.

Alternatively, perhaps using a better approximation for arcsin(x). For example, arcsin(x) =x +x³/6 +3x⁵/40 +... So, including the x⁵ term:

Sum≈sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² +k³/(6n⁶) +3k⁵/(40n^{10})]. The first two terms give1/2 +1/(24n²), and the third term is negligible. So, still approaching1/2.

Therefore, after multiple methods and checks, I'm confident that the limit is1/2. It's possible that the problem statement had a typo, or perhaps the intended solution used a different approach leading to2/3. However, based on standard approximation methods and numerical checks, the limit should be1/2. Therefore, I suspect the correct answer is1/2, and there might be an error in the problem statement.

To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that for small arguments, the arcsin function can be approximated by its Taylor series. Specifically, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 + ... when x is close to zero. Since we're dealing with the limit as n becomes very large, the terms k/n² for k from 1 to n will be very small because n² is in the denominator. So maybe I can approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² and then sum those up?

Let me check that approximation. If x is close to zero, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. But perhaps even just arcsin(x) ≈ x would be sufficient here because the higher-order terms might vanish when summed over k. Let's see. Let's denote x_k = k/n². Then, arcsin(x_k) ≈ x_k + (x_k)^3/6. So the sum would be approximately the sum of x_k plus the sum of (x_k)^3/6. 

But wait, if x_k is k/n², then the sum of x_k from k=1 to n is (1/n²) times the sum of k from 1 to n. The sum of k from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2, so that term becomes (1/n²)(n(n+1)/2) = (n+1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2 as n approaches infinity. 

Now, the next term is the sum of (x_k)^3/6, which is (1/(6n⁶)) times the sum of k³ from k=1 to n. The sum of k³ is [n(n+1)/2]^2, so that term becomes [ (n(n+1)/2)^2 ] / (6n⁶) ≈ (n⁴/4)/6n⁶ = 1/(24n²) which tends to zero as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the higher-order terms vanish, and the main contribution is the sum of x_k, which approaches 1/2. 

But wait, the problem statement mentions 2/3 in the question. Wait, no, looking back, the user wrote: ""Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) 2/3"". Maybe that's a typo or misformatting. Let me check again. The original problem is written as: ""Evaluate the limit: \\[ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\]\\frac{2}{3}"". Hmm, perhaps that last part is a mistake. Maybe the user intended to write the limit as 2/3? But the expression is written as the limit of the sum, followed by 2/3. That might be an error in formatting. I'll proceed assuming that the limit is just the sum part, and ignore the 2/3 unless there's more context.

But proceeding with the calculation, my initial approximation suggests that the limit is 1/2. But let me verify this more carefully. Maybe I need to be more precise in the approximation of arcsin(k/n²). 

Alternatively, another approach could be to use the integral approximation. For large n, the sum can be approximated by an integral. Let's see. Let me write k as a continuous variable x, so k/n² becomes x/n², and the sum becomes approximately an integral from x=1 to x=n of arcsin(x/n²) times delta x, where delta x is 1. But integrating over x from 1 to n with dx=1 isn't the standard approach. Maybe instead, consider substituting x = k/n², so that k = xn². Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, use a Riemann sum approximation.

Wait, the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by the integral from 0 to 1 of arcsin(t) * n dt, if we set t = k/n². Wait, perhaps not. Let me think again.

Let me consider that each term in the sum is arcsin(k/n²). For each k, when n is large, k/n² is small, so arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n². Then the sum is approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k/n². The sum of k from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2, so the sum becomes [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = (1 + 1/n)/2, which approaches 1/2 as n → ∞. 

But earlier, I thought the approximation was 1/2, but the problem statement had 2/3. Maybe my approximation is missing something. Let me check again. When approximating arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n², the sum becomes (1/2)(1 + 1/n) → 1/2. But perhaps the higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion contribute more? Let's check.

The next term in the expansion is (k/n²)³ / 6. So the sum of arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum [k/n² + (k³)/(6n⁶)]. The first sum is (1/2)(1 + 1/n) as before. The second sum is (1/(6n⁶)) * sum k³. The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2. So substituting that in, we get:

Sum ≈ (1/(6n⁶)) * (n²(n+1)²/4) = [n²(n+1)²]/(24n⁶) = (n+1)²/(24n⁴) ≈ 1/(24n²) which tends to zero as n → ∞. Therefore, the higher-order terms do vanish, so the main term is indeed 1/2. 

But maybe there's another approach. Let's consider the difference between arcsin(x) and x. For small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, the difference arcsin(x) - x ≈ x³/6. Therefore, the sum of arcsin(k/n²) = sum [k/n² + (k³)/(6n⁶) + ...]. As we saw, the sum of k/n² is ~1/2, and the sum of k³/n⁶ is ~1/(24n²) → 0. Therefore, the limit should be 1/2. 

But wait, the problem statement has a 2/3 in the question. Maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again. The user wrote: ""Evaluate the limit: \\[ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\]\\frac{2}{3}"". Maybe there's a typo here. Perhaps the limit is supposed to be 2/3? But according to my calculations, it's 1/2. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum, and the 2/3 is part of a different expression. But given the way it's written here, with the sum followed by \\frac{2}{3}, which is LaTeX for a fraction, perhaps it's a formatting error. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit and the answer is 2/3, but my calculation says 1/2. Hmm.

Wait, maybe my initial approximation is too crude. Let's try to be more precise. Let's use the Taylor series expansion of arcsin(x) around x=0:

arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ...

So, for each term in the sum, arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6. Therefore, the sum becomes:

Sum ≈ Σ_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)]

= (1/n²) Σk + (1/(6n⁶)) Σk³

As before, Σk = n(n+1)/2 ≈ n²/2, so the first term is (n²/2)/n² = 1/2.

The second term is Σk³ = [n(n+1)/2]^2 ≈ n⁴/4. So:

(1/(6n⁶))(n⁴/4) = 1/(24n²) → 0 as n→∞.

Therefore, the sum approaches 1/2. So why does the problem have 2/3? Maybe there's a miscalculation here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly. Let me check again. The user wrote:

""Return your fina Evaluate the limit: \\[ \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\]\\frac{2}{3}$

It looks like there's an extra \\frac{2}{3} at the end. Maybe that's a mistake. If the problem is just the limit of the sum, then the answer is 1/2. But if the problem is to evaluate the limit of (sum arcsin(k/n²)) * 2/3, then the answer would be 1/3. But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was different, but the user made a typo.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the approximation. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe using a better approximation. Let's consider that the sum of arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by integrating arcsin(x) over x from 0 to 1, scaled appropriately. Wait, but how?

Wait, if we set x = k/n², then k = xn², but since k goes from 1 to n, x goes from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. Wait, that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, maybe consider a substitution.

Let me try to write the sum as a Riemann sum. Let me set t = k/n, so that k = tn. Then, the term becomes arcsin( (tn)/n² ) = arcsin(t/n). But as n approaches infinity, t/n approaches zero. So arcsin(t/n) ≈ t/n + (t/n)^3 /6. Therefore, the sum becomes:

Sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(t/n) ≈ Sum_{k=1}^n [ t/n + (t/n)^3 /6 ] where t = k/n.

But wait, t = k/n, so k = tn. Therefore, the sum becomes:

Sum_{t=1/n}^{1} [ t/n + t³/(6n³) ] with delta t = 1/n.

Therefore, the sum is approximately the integral from t=0 to t=1 of [ t + t³/6 ] dt. Wait, but the step is 1/n, so the Riemann sum approximation would be:

Sum_{k=1}^n [ (k/n)/n + (k/n)^3/(6n³) ] = Sum_{k=1}^n [ k/n² + k³/(6n⁴) ]

Wait, that's the same as before. So integrating t from 0 to 1, we get integral from 0 to 1 of t dt = 1/2, and integral of t³/6 dt = (1/6)(1/4) = 1/24. But since in the Riemann sum, the step is 1/n, the approximation would be:

Sum ≈ integral from 0 to 1 of t dt + integral from 0 to 1 of t³/6 dt = 1/2 + 1/24 = 13/24. But that contradicts our previous result. Wait, no, because in reality, the Riemann sum approximation for a continuous function is integral (function) dx. But in our case, the sum is approximated by the integral of t from 0 to 1 (since t = k/n), but scaled appropriately.

Wait, maybe this approach isn't correct. Let's think again. If we set t = k/n, then the sum is Sum_{k=1}^n arcsin( (k/n)/n ) = Sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(t/n) ≈ Sum_{k=1}^n (t/n + (t/n)^3 /6 ). Then, the sum becomes Sum_{k=1}^n t/n + Sum_{k=1}^n t³/(6n³). 

But t = k/n, so Sum_{k=1}^n t/n = (1/n) Sum_{k=1}^n k/n = (1/n²) Sum_{k=1}^n k = (1/n²)(n(n+1)/2) = (n+1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2 as n→∞.

Similarly, Sum_{k=1}^n t³/(6n³) = (1/(6n³)) Sum_{k=1}^n (k/n)^3 = (1/(6n³)) Sum_{k=1}^n k³/n³ = (1/(6n⁶)) Sum_{k=1}^n k³. Sum of k³ is [n(n+1)/2]^2 ≈ n⁴/4. Therefore, this term is (1/(6n⁶))(n⁴/4) = 1/(24n²) → 0. So again, the main term is 1/2.

Therefore, the limit is 1/2. So why does the problem have 2/3? Maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, maybe I missed something.

Wait, perhaps the problem was supposed to be the sum of arcsin(k/n³), but that's just a guess. Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write the limit of the sum multiplied by n, but that would be different. Let's check:

If the problem had been lim_{n→∞} n * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), then we would have n*(1/2 + o(1)) → ∞, which is not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written correctly, but my approach is wrong. Let me try another method.

Consider that arcsin(x) ≤ x + x³/6 for x ≥ 0. Therefore, the sum Sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≤ Sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6]. As before, the first sum is ~1/2, the second sum is ~1/(24n²) → 0. Therefore, the upper bound is 1/2. Similarly, since arcsin(x) ≥ x for x ≥ 0, the sum is ≥ Sum_{k=1}^n k/n² ≈ 1/2. Therefore, by squeeze theorem, the limit is 1/2.

Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation here, the answer should be 1/2. But the problem mentions 2/3. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider more precise approximations.

Wait, perhaps the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is not sufficient here. Let's check the error in the approximation. The difference between arcsin(x) and x is x³/6 + higher-order terms. But when summing over k from 1 to n, the total error would be Sum_{k=1}^n (x_k³)/6, which we saw tends to zero. So the main term is indeed the sum of x_k, which is 1/2. 

Alternatively, maybe using a different approach. Let's consider the function f(x) = arcsin(x). For small x, f(x) ≈ x. Therefore, the sum is approximately Sum_{k=1}^n k/n² ≈ (n(n+1)/2)/n² ≈ (n² + n)/2n² ≈ (1 + 1/n)/2 → 1/2 as n → ∞. 

Alternatively, maybe integrating arcsin(k/n²) over k. Wait, integrating over discrete k doesn't make sense directly, but maybe approximate the sum as an integral. Let's consider k as a continuous variable. Let x = k/n², so k = xn². Then, dk = n² dx. The sum becomes approximately the integral from x=1/n² to x=1/n of arcsin(x) * n² dx. But the limits of integration are from x=1/n² to x=1/n, which is a very small interval near zero. However, integrating arcsin(x) over x from 0 to 1/n would be approximately integrating x over that interval, which is (1/n²)/2. But multiplied by n², gives 1/2. So that's consistent with the previous result.

Alternatively, let's use the mean value theorem for integrals. But I think this is getting too convoluted. All methods point to the limit being 1/2. 

Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation or a different approach required, I think the answer should be 1/2. However, considering the user included \\frac{2}{3} in the problem statement, which is likely a formatting error, I need to confirm once again.

Wait, perhaps the original problem was to evaluate the limit of the sum of arcsin(k/n) or something similar. Let me check the difference between arcsin(k/n²) and arcsin(k/n). For example, if it were arcsin(k/n), then the sum would be different. But according to the problem, it's k/n².

Alternatively, maybe there's a different expansion or a different approximation needed. Let's consider the sum of arcsin(k/n²) for k from 1 to n. Let me take n very large and approximate k/n² as a small x. Then, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Therefore, the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n x_k + sum_{k=1}^n x_k³/6. As before, the first sum is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² ≈ (n(n+1)/2)/n² ≈ 1/2. The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/n⁶ ≈ (n⁴/4)/n⁶ = 1/(4n²) → 0. Therefore, the total sum is 1/2 + 0 = 1/2. 

Therefore, unless there's an error in my reasoning, the limit should be 1/2. It's possible that the original problem had a different exponent or a different function, but based on the given problem, the answer is 1/2. The presence of 2/3 in the problem statement might be a typo or formatting error, which I will ignore as the user might have intended to write the limit expression without that fraction.

Thus, after thorough analysis and multiple approaches confirming the result, I conclude that the limit is 1/2.

To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}
\\]

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

Additionally, we verified using integral comparison. The integral \\(\\int_{0}^{n} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{n^2}\\right) \\, dx\\) was evaluated and found to approach \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), confirming our result.

Thus, the limit is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k equals 1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let's start by understanding what's going on here. 

First, I know that when dealing with limits of sums, especially as n becomes very large, integrals often come into play. Riemann sums are a classic way to approximate sums by integrals. Maybe I can use that here? But before jumping into that, let me analyze the terms in the sum.

The function inside the sum is arcsin(k/n²). For small arguments, the arcsin(x) function can be approximated by its Taylor series expansion. Since k goes from 1 to n, and n is going to infinity, each term k/n² will be small because k is at most n, so k/n² is at most 1/n, which goes to zero as n becomes large. So, maybe I can approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² for large n. Let me check that.

The Taylor series for arcsin(x) around x = 0 is x + x³/6 + (3x⁵)/40 + ... So, up to the first order, arcsin(x) ≈ x. Therefore, arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n². Then, the sum becomes approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k/n². Let's compute that sum.

The sum of k from 1 to n is n(n + 1)/2. So, dividing by n², we get [n(n + 1)/2]/n² = (n + 1)/(2n). As n approaches infinity, this simplifies to (1 + 1/n)/2, which approaches 1/2. So, if the approximation holds, the limit would be 1/2. But wait, the problem states that the limit is 2/3. That contradicts my current result. Hmm, maybe the first-order approximation isn't sufficient here. Let me think again.

Perhaps I need to consider higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of arcsin(x). Let's try including the next term. The arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. So, then the sum becomes approximately the sum from k=1 to n of [k/n² + (k/n²)³/6]. Let's compute each part separately.

First, the sum of k/n² is (n + 1)/(2n) as before, approaching 1/2. The second sum is the sum of (k³)/(6n⁶). Let's compute that. The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n + 1)/2]^2. Therefore, the sum becomes [n²(n + 1)²/4]/(6n⁶) = [(n + 1)²]/(24n⁴). As n approaches infinity, this term behaves like (n²)/(24n⁴) = 1/(24n²), which goes to zero. So, even if we include the next term, the total sum would approach 1/2 + 0 = 1/2. But the problem says the limit is 2/3. Now I'm confused.

Wait, maybe my approach using the Taylor expansion isn't appropriate here. Let me consider another method. Perhaps using an integral comparison. Since the sum is from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²), maybe I can approximate this sum by an integral. Let's see.

If I set x = k/n², then as n becomes large, the step between consecutive x's (which is 1/n²) becomes very small. But in the sum, each term is evaluated at x = k/n², so maybe the sum can be approximated by an integral from x = 1/n² to x = 1/n. Wait, but when k goes from 1 to n, x goes from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. However, as n approaches infinity, the upper limit approaches zero. Hmm, this seems tricky.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the integral test for series? If the function f(k) = arcsin(k/n²) is decreasing, then the sum can be approximated by an integral. Let's check if f(k) is decreasing. The derivative of f(k) with respect to k is [1 / sqrt(1 - (k/n²)²)] * (1/n²). Since k is positive and less than n, (k/n²)² is less than (n/n²)² = 1/n², so sqrt(1 - (k/n²)²) is close to 1. Therefore, the derivative is approximately 1/n², which is decreasing as n increases. Wait, but actually, as k increases, (k/n²) increases, so the derivative might actually be increasing? Let me recast.

Wait, f(k) = arcsin(k/n²). So df/dk = 1 / sqrt(1 - (k/n²)²) * (1/n²). Since k is from 1 to n, and n is going to infinity, (k/n²) is small, so sqrt(1 - (k/n²)²) ≈ 1 - (k/n²)² / 2. Therefore, df/dk ≈ (1/n²)(1 + (k/n²)² / 2). So, the derivative is positive and increasing as k increases because k/n² increases. Therefore, f(k) is an increasing function on k. Therefore, the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by an integral from 0 to n of arcsin(x/n²) dx, but I need to check the exact bounds.

Wait, actually, the sum is a left Riemann sum for the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx, with step size 1/n². Wait, no. Let's make a substitution. Let x = k/n². Then, when k goes from 1 to n, x goes from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. So, the sum is like sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x) where x is spaced by 1/n². The integral approximation would be the integral from x = 0 to x = 1/n of arcsin(x) dx. But as n approaches infinity, the upper limit approaches zero. So, the integral is from 0 to 0, which is zero. But that can't be right because the sum is approaching 1/2 according to my previous calculation. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, maybe I need to perform a variable substitution. Let me set t = k/n². Then, as n becomes large, t ranges from 1/n² to 1/n. But 1/n² is very small, and 1/n is also approaching zero. So, the upper limit is approaching zero. Therefore, the integral approximation would be the integral from t = 0 to t = 0 of arcsin(t) dt, which is zero. But that contradicts the sum approaching 1/2. So, maybe the Riemann sum approach isn't straightforward here because the interval of integration is shrinking as n increases.

Alternatively, perhaps I can make a substitution where I let t = k/n. Then, k = tn, and as n increases, t ranges from 0 to 1. But wait, in this case, the original sum is over k from 1 to n, so t would go from 1/n to 1. But the term inside the arcsin is k/n² = t/n. So, arcsin(t/n). Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(t/n) where t = k/n. So, this is similar to sum_{k=1}^n arcsin((k/n)/n). So, maybe we can approximate this as a Riemann sum.

Wait, let me try that. Let t = k/n, so that k = tn, and the step size is Δt = 1/n. Then, the sum becomes sum_{t=1/n}^{1} arcsin(t/n) Δt. But arcsin(t/n) ≈ t/n for small t/n. So, the sum approximates the integral from t = 0 to t = 1 of (t/n) dt. Wait, but t/n is (t/n), so integrating that from 0 to 1 would give (1/(2n)). Then, summing over n terms would give n*(1/(2n)) = 1/2, which matches the previous result. But again, this suggests the limit is 1/2, but the problem states it's 2/3. So, there must be an error in my reasoning here.

Wait, maybe the substitution isn't correct. Let me check again. If t = k/n, then k = tn, so arcsin(k/n²) = arcsin(t/(n)). Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(t/n) where t ranges from 0 to 1. But the step size in t is Δt = 1/n. Therefore, the sum can be approximated as the integral from t = 0 to t = 1 of arcsin(t/n) dt. But since n is going to infinity, t/n is approaching zero, so arcsin(t/n) ≈ t/n. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (t/n) dt = (1/n)(1/2) = 1/(2n). Then, multiplying by n (since the sum is n terms each approximated by 1/(2n)), we get 1/2. So, again, the same result. But this contradicts the given answer of 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is too crude here. Let's try to do a better approximation. Let's consider the Taylor series up to higher order terms.

We have arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + (3x⁵)/40 + ... So, if we take arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)³/6. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)]. As before, the first term is (n + 1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2. The second term is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [ (n(n + 1)/2)^2 ]/(6n⁶) ≈ (n²/4)/6n⁶ = 1/(24n²), which goes to zero. So, still, the total sum approaches 1/2. But the problem says 2/3. Therefore, either my approach is wrong, or there's a different method required.

Wait, maybe I should consider that the sum can be approximated by an integral with a different variable substitution. Let's try to set x = k/n², so that k = xn², and as n approaches infinity, x ranges from 0 to 1/n. But this seems similar to before. Alternatively, perhaps another substitution.

Wait, let's try to approximate the sum by an integral where the variable of integration is x = k/n. Then, k = xn, and the term becomes arcsin((xn)/n²) = arcsin(x/n). Then, the sum can be approximated by the integral from x = 0 to x = 1 of arcsin(x/n) * (dx) where dx = 1/n. Wait, but this is similar to the previous approach. So, the integral would be ∫₀¹ arcsin(x/n) dx. Then, as n approaches infinity, x/n approaches zero, so arcsin(x/n) ≈ x/n. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (x/n) dx = 1/(2n). Then, the sum would be approximately n*(1/(2n)) = 1/2. Again, same result. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is sufficient. Let's test with specific values. For example, take n very large, say n = 1000. Then, k ranges up to 1000, so k/n² ranges up to 1000/1,000,000 = 0.001. Then, arcsin(0.001) ≈ 0.001000000166666..., so the approximation is very good. Therefore, the higher-order terms in the Taylor series are negligible for large n. So, why does the problem say the limit is 2/3?

Wait, maybe I miscalculated the sum. Let me recheck. The sum from k=1 to n of k/n² is equal to (1/n²) * sum_{k=1}^n k = (1/n²)(n(n + 1)/2) = (n + 1)/(2n) = (1 + 1/n)/2. As n approaches infinity, this approaches 1/2. So, that's correct. So, according to this, the limit should be 1/2, but the problem states 2/3. There must be an error in the problem, or perhaps I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check the problem again. It says: ""Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²)"" and then it mentions ""frac{2}{3}"". Maybe there's a typo? Or perhaps the problem is written incorrectly. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me confirm.

The problem is: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). The user mentions ""frac{2}{3}"" as part of the question, but maybe that's a formatting error. Let me assume that the problem is correctly presented as lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), and the answer is 1/2. However, the user provided a fraction 2/3 in the formatting, which might be a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written differently.

Wait, perhaps the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) instead of sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n). Let me check that. If it were arcsin(k/n), then the sum would be different. For example, if it were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), then as n approaches infinity, the sum would be approximated by the integral from 0 to 1 of arcsin(x) dx, which is [x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²)] from 0 to 1, which equals (1*π/2 + 0) - 0 = π/2. But that's not 2/3. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) but with a different interpretation. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I need to consider a different approach.

Wait, let's consider the original sum: sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me approximate arcsin(k/n²) using the first-order approximation: arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6]. The first term is (n + 1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2. The second term is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶). The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n + 1)/2]^2. Therefore, the second term is [n²(n + 1)^2 / 4]/(6n⁶) = (n²(n² + 2n + 1)/4)/(6n⁶) = (n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2)/(24n^6) ≈ (n^4)/(24n^6) = 1/(24n²). As n approaches infinity, this term goes to zero. Therefore, the total sum is approximately 1/2, so the limit is 1/2.

But the user mentioned ""frac{2}{3}"" at the end, which is confusing. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem. Alternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me try another approach.

Suppose we consider the sum S(n) = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me make the substitution x = k/n². Then, k = x n², and as n approaches infinity, x ranges from 0 to 1/n. But this seems similar to previous attempts. Alternatively, let's consider that for large n, the terms k/n² are small, so we can approximate arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n². Then, the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = [n(n + 1)/2]/n² = (n + 1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2. So, again, 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the problem, and the correct answer is 1/2. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n) instead of k/n². Let me check that. If it were arcsin(k/n), then the sum would be approximated by the integral from 0 to 1 of arcsin(x) dx, which is [x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²)] from 0 to 1, which equals π/2 ≈ 1.5708, which is not 2/3. Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k)/n². But that would be different.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) and the answer is indeed 1/2, and the user made a typo with 2/3. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something here.

Wait, let me try to compute the sum numerically for a large n to check. Let's take n = 1000. Then, the sum would be approximately sum_{k=1}^{1000} k/(1000)^2. The sum is (1000*1001)/(2*1000^2) = (1001)/2000 ≈ 0.5005. If we include the next term in the Taylor series, sum_{k=1}^{1000} (k/1000^2 + (k/1000^2)^3/6). The first term is 0.5005, and the second term is sum_{k=1}^{1000} k³/(6*1000^6). The sum of k³ is (1000*1001/2)^2 ≈ (500500)^2 ≈ 2.505e11. Divided by 6*1000^6 = 6e18, gives approximately 4.175e-8. So, the second term is negligible. Therefore, the total sum is approximately 0.5005, which approaches 0.5 as n increases. So, this suggests the limit is 1/2.

But the problem states 2/3. Maybe the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps I misread the problem. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem is written as: ""lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²)"". Maybe there's a different interpretation. For example, if the sum is over k from 1 to n, but the argument is k/(n²), then yes, as we did. Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and the intended limit is 2/3. If so, perhaps there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe using the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to something. Wait, let's try to approximate the sum by an integral. Let me set x = k/n². Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x). The step size in x is Δx = 1/n². But the interval of integration is from x = 1/n² to x = 1/n. As n approaches infinity, this interval is from 0 to 0. Therefore, the integral approximation isn't helpful here. Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution where we set t = k/n. Then, k = tn, and the term becomes arcsin((tn)/n²) = arcsin(t/n). The sum becomes sum_{t=1/n}^{1} arcsin(t/n) * Δt, where Δt = 1/n. So, this sum approximates the integral from t = 0 to t = 1 of arcsin(t/n) dt. As n approaches infinity, t/n approaches zero, so arcsin(t/n) ≈ t/n. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (t/n) dt = 1/(2n). Then, multiplying by n (since the sum has n terms), we get 1/2. So, again, same result.

Alternatively, maybe integrating the original function. Let me consider that the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by the integral from k = 0 to k = n of arcsin(k/n²) dk. Let me make a substitution: let x = k/n², so k = xn², dk = n² dx. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) * n² dx. But as n approaches infinity, the upper limit approaches zero, so arcsin(x) ≈ x. Therefore, the integral ≈ ∫₀^{1/n} x * n² dx = n² * [x²/2]₀^{1/n} = n² * (1/(2n²)) = 1/2. So, the integral approximation gives 1/2, which matches our previous results.

Therefore, all methods suggest that the limit is 1/2. However, the problem mentions 2/3, which is conflicting. Perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, let's consider another approach. Maybe using the Stolz-Cesàro theorem. But Stolz-Cesàro is used for sequences of the form a_n / b_n when certain conditions are met. Let me see if that applies here. The sum S(n) = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). If we consider S(n) as a sequence, and we want to find lim_{n→∞} S(n). But Stolz-Cesàro might not be directly applicable here unless we can relate S(n) to another sequence.

Alternatively, maybe using the mean value theorem. For each term arcsin(k/n²), there exists a c_k such that arcsin(k/n²) = (k/n²)/sqrt(1 - c_k²). But since k/n² is small, c_k is approximately k/n², so sqrt(1 - c_k²) ≈ 1 - (c_k²)/2 ≈ 1 - (k²)/(2n⁴). Therefore, arcsin(k/n²) ≈ (k/n²) + (k³)/(2n⁶). Which is similar to the Taylor expansion we did earlier. So, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(2n⁶)]. Again, the first term gives 1/2, the second term is negligible. Therefore, the sum approaches 1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider the sum as a telescoping series or use another method. But I don't see a telescoping structure here. Alternatively, integrating by parts. But since we're dealing with a sum, integrating by parts isn't directly applicable.

Wait, another idea: use the fact that arcsin(x) = ∫₀^x 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n ∫₀^{k/n²} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Exchanging the sum and integral (if allowed), we get ∫₀^{1/n} sum_{k=1}^n [1/sqrt(1 - t²) for t ∈ [ (k-1)/n², k/n² ) ] dt. But this seems complicated. The integrand would be a piecewise constant function over intervals of length 1/n². So, the integral becomes sum_{k=1}^n ∫_{(k-1)/n²}^{k/n²} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. But since the intervals are small, we can approximate 1/sqrt(1 - t²) ≈ 1 for t near zero. Therefore, the integral is approximately sum_{k=1}^n (1/n²) * 1 = n * (1/n²) = 1/n, which approaches zero. But this contradicts our previous results. Therefore, this approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, maybe this interchange of sum and integral is not valid, or the approximation is incorrect. The problem is that even though the intervals are small, the function 1/sqrt(1 - t²) is approximately 1, but integrating over a small interval gives approximately the length of the interval. Therefore, the total integral is approximately n * (1/n²) = 1/n, which goes to zero. But this contradicts the sum approaching 1/2. Therefore, this method is not correct.

Perhaps I need to consider that the function inside the sum is not approximately linear, but maybe there's another approximation. Let me think. For small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, if I take more terms, but we saw that the higher-order terms vanish as n increases. Therefore, the leading term is x, which gives the sum approaching 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to approximate the sum. Let's consider that the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by the integral from k = 0 to k = n of arcsin(k/n²) dk. Let me make the substitution x = k/n², so k = xn², dk = n² dx. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) n² dx. As n approaches infinity, the upper limit approaches zero, and arcsin(x) ≈ x, so the integral becomes ∫₀^{1/n} x n² dx = n² [x²/2]₀^{1/n} = n² (1/(2n²)) = 1/2. Therefore, the integral approximation gives 1/2, which again matches the earlier results.

Given that all methods point to the limit being 1/2, I think the problem might have a typo, and the correct answer should be 1/2. Alternatively, maybe the original problem was different, such as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), which would have a different limit. But as it stands, the given problem's limit is 1/2.

But the user included ""frac{2}{3}"" at the end of the problem statement, which might be a formatting error. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me try one last time.

Wait, if I consider that the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by the integral from 0 to n of arcsin(x/n²) dx. Let's compute that integral. Let u = x/n², so x = n²u, dx = n² du. The integral becomes ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(u) n² du. As n approaches infinity, the upper limit approaches zero, and arcsin(u) ≈ u. Therefore, the integral ≈ ∫₀^{1/n} u n² du = n² [u²/2]₀^{1/n} = n² (1/(2n²)) = 1/2. So, again, the same result.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) but with a different interpretation of the variable. For example, if k is from 1 to n², but that's not the case here. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and the limit is 2/3 for a similar sum. For example, if the sum were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n³), then the approximation would differ. But the current problem states n² in the denominator.

Given all this, I think the correct answer is 1/2. The mention of 2/3 might be a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, if I misapplied a method, perhaps I need to check again.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the problem is to evaluate the limit of the average of the sum, but that's not the case here. The problem is the sum itself, not the average. Alternatively, maybe there's a different expansion for arcsin that I missed. Let me check the Taylor series again.

The Taylor series for arcsin(x) around x = 0 is indeed x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, up to the first order, it's x. Therefore, for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x. Therefore, the sum should be approximated by the sum of k/n², leading to 1/2. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in discrete mathematics and the sum converges to an integral over a different interval. For example, using a substitution where x = k/n, then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin((k/n)/n) = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x/n) where x = k/n. Then, approximating this as an integral from x = 0 to 1 of arcsin(x/n) dx. As n approaches infinity, this integral becomes ∫₀¹ (x/n) dx = 1/(2n). Then, multiplying by n (since the sum has n terms), we get 1/2. So, again, 1/2.

Given all these approaches consistently leading to 1/2, I must conclude that either the problem statement is incorrect, or there's a misunderstanding in the problem's intent. If the problem indeed states the limit is 2/3, then there might be a different setup or a different function involved. However, based on the current information and standard methods, the limit should be 1/2.

To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}
\\]

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let's see. First, I remember that when dealing with limits of sums, especially as n becomes large, Riemann sums often come into play. But here, instead of a function evaluated at points, we have the arcsin function. 

Wait, let's break this down. The term inside the arcsin is k/n². Since n is going to infinity and k goes from 1 to n, the maximum value of k/n² would be n/n² = 1/n, which approaches 0 as n becomes large. So, for large n, k/n² is a small positive number. Therefore, we can approximate arcsin(x) for small x. 

I recall that for small x, arcsin(x) is approximately equal to x + x³/6 + ... So maybe we can approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² plus some higher-order terms. Let's try that. 

So, replacing arcsin(k/n²) with k/n², the sum becomes the sum from k=1 to n of k/n². The sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2, so this approximation would give us [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = (1 + 1/n)/2. As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. But wait, is this the correct approximation? Because we approximated arcsin(x) by x, but maybe we need to consider more terms in the Taylor expansion to get a better approximation. 

Let me check the Taylor series of arcsin(x). The expansion is x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So for very small x, the higher-order terms are negligible. But here, x is k/n². Since k can go up to n, the maximum x is n/n² = 1/n. So, even the x³ term would be (1/n)³ = 1/n³. So the sum of the x³ terms would be sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3 = sum_{k=1}^n k³/n⁶. The sum of k³ is [n(n+1)/2]^2, so this sum is approximately n⁴/n⁶ = 1/n², which tends to 0 as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the higher-order terms in the arcsin expansion contribute a negligible amount to the sum. 

Therefore, the approximation of arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² is sufficient, and the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = 1/2 + 1/(2n). As n approaches infinity, 1/(2n) goes to 0, so the limit is 1/2. 

Wait, but the problem mentions the fraction 2/3. Did I make a mistake? Let me double-check. 

Wait, maybe the approximation isn't enough. Let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? For example, using integrals. Since we have a sum that resembles a Riemann sum. Let's see. 

If we consider the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's set x = k/n². Then, the sum can be thought of as a sum over x from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. But the width between each term is Δx = 1/n². So the sum is approximately the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx. Wait, but integrating with respect to x, but x is from 0 to 1/n. Hmm, but if we use substitution, let t = x n², then x = t/n², dx = dt/n². Then the integral becomes integral from t=0 to t=1 of arcsin(t/n²) * dt/n². Wait, but that might not be straightforward. 

Alternatively, maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let's try to express the sum as a Riemann sum. Let me note that the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's set x_k = k/n². Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k). The spacing between x_k is Δx = 1/n². However, the sum is over x from 1/n² to n/n². But integrating arcsin(x) over x from 0 to 1/n would be similar, but the sum is a discrete sum over x with a spacing of 1/n². So the sum can be approximated by the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx. But as n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the integral from 0 to 0 is 0. But that contradicts our earlier result of 1/2. Therefore, this approach might not be correct. 

Wait, maybe this is a case where the Riemann sum analogy isn't directly applicable because the function is being evaluated at points that are spaced too far apart? Let me think. The problem is that when we approximate a sum by an integral, the spacing between the points in the sum should be related to the differential in the integral. In the standard Riemann sum, the sum is over points x_i with spacing Δx, and the integral is the limit as Δx approaches 0. But here, the spacing Δx = 1/n², which does approach 0 as n approaches infinity. So the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) dx. But as n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the integral approaches 0. However, this contradicts our initial approximation where we approximated the sum by 1/2. 

Therefore, there must be an error in one of these approaches. Let's check again. 

If we approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n², then the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = 1/2 + 1/(2n). As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. But according to the integral approach, the sum is approximated by the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx, which is approximately the integral from 0 to 0 of arcsin(x) dx, which is 0. So which is correct? 

Wait, perhaps the problem is that the Riemann sum analogy isn't directly applicable here. Let's consider the following. If we have a function f(x) and we want to approximate the sum sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k) where x_k = a + kΔx, then the sum is approximately the integral from a to a + nΔx of f(x) dx. However, in our case, a = 1/n², Δx = 1/n², and the upper limit is a + nΔx = 1/n² + n*(1/n²) = 1/n² + 1/n. So the integral would be from 1/n² to 1/n + 1/n². But as n approaches infinity, the lower limit approaches 0 and the upper limit approaches 0. Therefore, the integral approaches 0. However, our approximation of the sum by the sum of k/n² gives a finite limit. 

This suggests that the approximation arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² is not capturing the entire behavior of the sum. Let's check if there's a better approximation. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the fact that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Let's try including the next term in the expansion. So, arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3 / 6. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)]. The first term is sum k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² ≈ 1/2. The second term is sum k³/(6n⁶) = [ (n(n+1)/2)^2 ] / (6n⁶ ) ≈ [n⁴/4]/(6n⁶) = 1/(24n²). As n approaches infinity, this term goes to 0. So the total sum is approximately 1/2. 

But then, why does the integral approach suggest 0? There's a conflict here. 

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the Riemann sum approximation isn't appropriate here because the function is being evaluated at points that are spaced too far apart relative to the function's behavior. Alternatively, maybe the sum can be approximated by an integral with a different substitution. 

Let me try another approach. Let's consider that the sum can be approximated by integrating over k, treating k as a continuous variable. So, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ n ∫₀¹ arcsin(x/n²) dx. Wait, but this might not be the correct substitution. Let me think again. 

If we let x = k/n², then k = xn², and the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x) where x ranges from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. But the step in x is Δx = 1/n². So the sum can be approximated by the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) dx. But as n approaches infinity, this integral becomes the integral from 0 to 0, which is 0. But this contradicts the previous result. 

Therefore, there's a problem here. The two different approaches give different results. Which one is correct? 

Wait, maybe the confusion arises because the function arcsin(x) is being evaluated at points where x is very small, but the sum is over a number of terms that's increasing as n increases. So even though each individual term is small, the number of terms is n, so the sum might not be negligible. Let's compute the sum of arcsin(k/n²) for k from 1 to n, and see if it's approximately 1/2. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use the mean value theorem or some other approximation. Let's consider that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x. So the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² ≈ 1/2. So the limit is 1/2. 

But why does the integral approach give 0? Let's see. If we approximate the sum by the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx, then as n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the integral approaches 0. But the sum is approximated by the sum of n terms each approximately 1/n², so the sum is approximately n*(1/n²) = 1/n, which tends to 0? Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, if each term is approximately 1/n², then the sum is sum_{k=1}^n 1/n² = n*(1/n²) = 1/n, which tends to 0. But that contradicts our previous result. Wait, no, this can't be. 

Wait, hold on. If we approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n², then each term is k/n², so the sum is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = 1/2 + 1/(2n). So this tends to 1/2. But if we approximate each term by 1/n², then the sum is n*(1/n²) = 1/n, which tends to 0. So clearly, the first approximation is better because we used the linear approximation of arcsin(x) ≈ x, not a constant. 

Therefore, the error in the integral approach might be that when approximating the sum by an integral, we need to consider how the function scales with the variables. Let me try to formalize this. 

Let me set x = k/n². Then, k = xn², and the sum becomes sum_{x=1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(x) * Δx, where Δx = 1/n². But the sum is approximated by the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) dx. However, as n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the integral becomes the integral from 0 to 0 of arcsin(x) dx, which is 0. But this contradicts the other approximation. 

Therefore, there must be a mistake in assuming that the sum can be approximated by the integral from 0 to 1/n. Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider a change of variables. Let me try to let t = k/n². Then, t ranges from 1/n² to 1/n. Let me write the sum as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(t) where t = k/n². Then, if we approximate the sum by an integral, we need to express it in terms of t. However, t is not a continuous variable here. Alternatively, maybe we can use the Euler-Maclaurin formula to approximate the sum. But that might be complicated. 

Alternatively, let's consider the following. Since k/n² is small for large n, we can approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)]. The first term is sum k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = 1/2 + 1/(2n). The second term is sum k³/(6n⁶) = [ (n(n+1)/2)^2 ] / (6n⁶ ) ≈ [n⁴/4]/(6n⁶) = 1/(24n²). So as n approaches infinity, the sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²), which tends to 1/2. Therefore, the limit is 1/2. 

But why does the integral approach give 0? Let's see. Maybe the integral approach is not applicable here because the number of terms in the sum is n, which increases as n increases, but the interval over which we are integrating is shrinking as 1/n. Therefore, the product of the number of terms (n) and the width of each term (Δx = 1/n²) is n * 1/n² = 1/n, which tends to 0. But in reality, the sum is approximated by the integral plus correction terms. 

Alternatively, maybe the correct way to approximate the sum is by considering that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x, so the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n², which is 1/2. Therefore, the limit is 1/2. 

But the problem mentions 2/3. Wait, maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check again. 

Alternatively, maybe the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is insufficient, and we need a better approximation. Let's compute the sum of arcsin(k/n²) for k from 1 to n. 

Alternatively, consider the following: Let's denote x = k/n². Then, k = xn². So, the sum can be written as sum_{x=1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(x) * n² dx, but this is a bit hand-wavy. Wait, actually, when approximating a sum by an integral, the general formula is sum_{k=a}^b f(kΔx) ≈ (1/Δx) ∫_{aΔx}^{bΔx} f(x) dx. In our case, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's set Δx = 1/n². Then, x = kΔx = k/n². So the sum is sum_{x=1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(x) * n² Δx. Wait, no, that formula is when you have sum_{k} f(kΔx) ≈ (1/Δx) ∫ f(x) dx from aΔx to bΔx. So in our case, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k), where x_k = k/n². Then, using the approximation, this sum ≈ (1/Δx) ∫_{x=1/n²}^{x=1/n} arcsin(x) dx. But Δx = 1/n², so this becomes n² ∫_{1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. 

Let's compute this integral. Let's compute ∫ arcsin(x) dx. The integral of arcsin(x) is x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²) + C. So, evaluating from 1/n² to 1/n:

[ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2) ] - [ (1/n²) arcsin(1/n²) + sqrt(1 - (1/n²)^2) ]

As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, and 1/n² approaches 0. So arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3/6, and arcsin(1/n²) ≈ 1/n² + (1/n²)^3/6. 

Therefore, the first term:

(1/n) arcsin(1/n) ≈ (1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³)) = 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴)

sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2) ≈ sqrt(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²) using the expansion sqrt(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 for small x.

Similarly, the second term:

(1/n²) arcsin(1/n²) ≈ (1/n²)(1/n² + 1/(6n⁶)) = 1/n⁴ + 1/(6n⁸)

sqrt(1 - (1/n²)^2) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n⁴)

Putting it all together:

First part: [1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) + 1 - 1/(2n²)] = [1 - 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) - 1/(2n²)] = 1 - (3/(2n²)) + 1/(6n⁴)

Second part: [1/n⁴ + 1/(6n⁸) + 1 - 1/(2n⁴)] = [1 + 1/(6n⁸) - 1/(2n⁴) + 1/n⁴] = 1 - 1/(2n⁴) + 1/(6n⁸)

Subtracting the second part from the first part:

[1 - 3/(2n²) + 1/(6n⁴)] - [1 - 1/(2n⁴) + 1/(6n⁸)] = -3/(2n²) + 1/(6n⁴) + 1/(2n⁴) - 1/(6n⁸) = -3/(2n²) + (2/6 + 1/6)/n⁴ - 1/(6n⁸) = -3/(2n²) + (3/6)/n⁴ - 1/(6n⁸) = -3/(2n²) + 1/(2n⁴) - 1/(6n⁸)

Therefore, the integral from 1/n² to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx ≈ -3/(2n²) + 1/(2n⁴) - 1/(6n⁸)

Multiplying by n² (from the approximation sum ≈ (1/Δx) ∫ ... dx = n² ∫ ... dx):

n² * [ -3/(2n²) + 1/(2n⁴) - 1/(6n⁸) ] = -3/2 + 1/(2n²) - 1/(6n⁶)

As n approaches infinity, this tends to -3/2. But this contradicts our previous result of 1/2. Clearly, there's a problem here. 

Wait, this can't be right. The integral approximation gives a negative value, which is impossible because arcsin(x) is positive for x > 0. So there must be an error in the calculation. 

Let me check the integral of arcsin(x). The integral of arcsin(x) dx is x arcsin(x) + sqrt(1 - x²) + C. So when evaluating from a to b, it's [b arcsin(b) + sqrt(1 - b²)] - [a arcsin(a) + sqrt(1 - a²)]. 

Let's compute for a = 1/n² and b = 1/n:

First term at b = 1/n:

(1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - (1/n)^2)

Second term at a = 1/n²:

(1/n²) arcsin(1/n²) + sqrt(1 - (1/n²)^2)

So subtracting the second term from the first term:

(1/n) arcsin(1/n) + sqrt(1 - 1/n²) - (1/n²) arcsin(1/n²) - sqrt(1 - 1/n⁴)

Now, expand each term using Taylor series for small x:

For x = 1/n, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6, and sqrt(1 - x²) ≈ 1 - x²/2.

Similarly, for x = 1/n², arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6, and sqrt(1 - x²) ≈ 1 - x²/2.

So, compute each part:

First term: (1/n)(1/n + 1/(6n³)) + (1 - 1/(2n²)) = 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) + 1 - 1/(2n²) = 1 - 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴)

Second term: (1/n²)(1/n² + 1/(6n⁶)) + (1 - 1/(2n⁴)) = 1/n⁴ + 1/(6n⁸) + 1 - 1/(2n⁴) = 1 - 1/(2n⁴) + 1/(6n⁸)

Subtracting the second term from the first term:

[1 - 1/n² + 1/(6n⁴)] - [1 - 1/(2n⁴) + 1/(6n⁸)] = -1/n² + 1/(6n⁴) + 1/(2n⁴) - 1/(6n⁸) = -1/n² + (2/6 + 1/6)/n⁴ - 1/(6n⁸) = -1/n² + 1/(2n⁴) - 1/(6n⁸)

Therefore, the integral from 1/n² to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx ≈ -1/n² + 1/(2n⁴) - 1/(6n⁸)

Then, multiplying by n² (from the approximation sum ≈ n² ∫ ... dx):

n² * (-1/n² + 1/(2n⁴) - 1/(6n⁸)) = -1 + 1/(2n²) - 1/(6n⁶)

As n approaches infinity, this tends to -1. But this is impossible because the sum of positive terms cannot be negative. Therefore, there must be an error in this approach. 

This suggests that approximating the sum by an integral in this way is not valid. Therefore, perhaps the initial approach of approximating arcsin(k/n²) by k/n² is the correct one, leading to the limit being 1/2. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the way we're applying the Riemann sum. Let's think differently. Let's set m = n², so as n approaches infinity, m approaches infinity as well. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/m). But m = n², so k ranges from 1 to n, and m is n². So the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). 

Alternatively, perhaps we can make a substitution. Let's set x = k/n², so k = xn². Then, the sum becomes sum_{x=1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(x) * n² dx, but this is similar to the integral approach. 

Wait, but perhaps instead of approximating the sum directly, we can use a telescoping series or another technique. Alternatively, consider the following identity: arcsin(x) = ∫₀^x 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. So, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n ∫₀^{k/n²} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. 

If we interchange the sum and the integral, we get ∫₀^{1/n} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) * sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² > t] dt. Wait, but this might complicate things. 

Alternatively, approximate the sum as an integral. For large n, the sum can be approximated by the integral from t=0 to t=1/n of 1/sqrt(1 - t²) * n² t dt. Wait, where does this come from? If we think of the sum as a Riemann sum with variable t = k/n², then the sum of arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by the integral over t from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(t) * n² dt. Wait, but this is similar to the previous approach. 

But let's compute this integral. ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(t) * n² dt. Let's make substitution u = t n², then t = u/n², dt = du/n². So the integral becomes ∫₀^{1} arcsin(u/n²) * n² * du/n² = ∫₀^{1} arcsin(u/n²) du. As n approaches infinity, u/n² approaches 0, so arcsin(u/n²) ≈ u/n². Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^{1} (u/n²) du = 1/(2n²). So multiplying by n² gives 1/2. Therefore, the sum is approximately 1/2. 

Wait, this seems to align with our initial approximation. So according to this, the limit is 1/2. 

But why did the previous integral approach give a negative value? Because there was an error in the way the integral was evaluated. The correct way is to approximate the sum by n² times the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(t) dt, which, using substitution, becomes ∫₀^{1} arcsin(u/n²) du ≈ ∫₀^{1} u/n² du = 1/(2n²). Then, multiplying by n² gives 1/2. 

Therefore, the correct limit is indeed 1/2. 

But the problem statement mentions the fraction 2/3. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement or in my reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps I missed something. Let me verify with another approach. 

Let's consider the sum S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n². Then, S ≈ sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = [n(n+1)/2]/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = 1/2 + 1/(2n). As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. 

Alternatively, let's compute the sum using the Taylor series up to the second term. So, arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6. Then, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)] = [n(n+1)/2]/n² + [sum_{k=1}^n k³]/(6n⁶). The first term is 1/2 + 1/(2n), the second term is [n²(n+1)^2/4]/(6n⁶) ≈ [n⁴/4]/(6n⁶) = 1/(24n²). So overall, the sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²). As n approaches infinity, the limit is 1/2. 

Therefore, all these methods suggest that the limit is 1/2. However, the problem mentions 2/3. Is there a miscalculation here? Let me check once again. 

Wait, maybe the original problem had a different exponent? If instead of k/n², it was k/n³, then the approximation would be different. But as stated, it's k/n². 

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider the sum S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's use the identity arcsin(x) = ∫₀^x 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Therefore, S = sum_{k=1}^n ∫₀^{k/n²} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Interchanging sum and integral (if allowed), we get S = ∫₀^{1/n} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) * sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² > t] dt. 

The sum over k=1 to n of [k/n² > t] is equal to the number of k such that k > t n². Since t ranges from 0 to 1/n, t n² ranges from 0 to 1. Therefore, the number of k > t n² is n - floor(t n²). For t in [k/n², (k+1)/n²), the sum is n - k. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^{1/n} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) * (n - t n²) dt. 

So, S = ∫₀^{1/n} (n - t n²) / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Let's split this into two integrals:

S = n ∫₀^{1/n} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt - n² ∫₀^{1/n} t / sqrt(1 - t²) dt.

Compute each integral separately. 

First integral: I₁ = ∫₀^{1/n} 1/sqrt(1 - t²) dt. This is arcsin(t) evaluated from 0 to 1/n, so I₁ = arcsin(1/n). As n approaches infinity, arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3/6.

Second integral: I₂ = ∫₀^{1/n} t / sqrt(1 - t²) dt. Let u = 1 - t², du = -2t dt, so I₂ = ∫_{1}^{1 - 1/n²} (-du/2)/sqrt(u) = (1/2) ∫_{1 - 1/n²}^{1} u^{-1/2} du = (1/2) [2 sqrt(u)]_{1 - 1/n²}^{1} = sqrt(1) - sqrt(1 - 1/n²) = 1 - sqrt(1 - 1/n²). As n approaches infinity, sqrt(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²). Therefore, I₂ ≈ 1 - (1 - 1/(2n²)) = 1/(2n²).

Therefore, putting it all together:

S ≈ n [1/n + 1/(6n³)] - n² [1/(2n²)] = [1 + 1/(6n²)] - [1/2] = 1 + 1/(6n²) - 1/2 = 1/2 + 1/(6n²). 

As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. 

Therefore, all methods consistently lead to the limit being 1/2. 

Given that the problem mentions the fraction 2/3, I suspect there might be a typo in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning. However, after carefully checking through multiple approaches—approximating the sum by a Riemann sum, expanding the arcsin function using its Taylor series, and evaluating the sum by converting it into an integral—the consistent result is 1/2. 

Therefore, the limit is 1/2, which is 0.5. However, the problem mentions 2/3, so there might be a mistake. Alternatively, if the original problem was to evaluate the sum of arcsin(k/n³), the answer would be different. For example, if the exponent was 3 instead of 2, then the approximation would be different. 

Wait, let's check that. Suppose the sum was from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n³). Then, k/n³ approaches 0 as n approaches infinity, and the approximation arcsin(k/n³) ≈ k/n³. Then, the sum would be approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n³ = [n(n+1)/2]/n³ ≈ 1/(2n). Which tends to 0. But that's not 2/3 either. 

Alternatively, if the problem was to evaluate the sum of arcsin(k/n) or something else. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is a misprint, and the intended sum was from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n), which would be different. For example, if x_k = k/n, then the sum would be approximately ∫₀¹ arcsin(x) dx. Let's compute that integral. 

∫₀¹ arcsin(x) dx. Let u = arcsin(x), dv = dx. Then, du = 1/sqrt(1 - x²) dx, v = x. Integration by parts gives uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ x/sqrt(1 - x²) dx. At x=1, uv = arcsin(1)*1 = π/2. At x=0, it's 0. The integral becomes π/2 - ∫₀¹ x/sqrt(1 - x²) dx. Let u = 1 - x², du = -2x dx. Then, the integral becomes π/2 - (1/2) ∫₀¹ u^{-1/2} du = π/2 - (1/2)[2 sqrt(u)]₀¹ = π/2 - (1/2)(2*1 - 0) = π/2 - 1 ≈ 1.5708 - 1 = 0.5708, which is approximately 2/3. So if the problem had been sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), the limit would be π/2 - 1 ≈ 0.5708, which is close to 2/3 (0.6667). But not exactly. However, 2/3 is approximately 0.6667, which is larger than π/2 - 1. 

Alternatively, if the problem had been sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n) with a different approximation. 

But given the problem as stated, with k/n², the limit is 1/2. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation here, the answer should be 1/2. 

But since the problem mentions 2/3, perhaps there was a different intended path. Let me think once again. 

Wait, perhaps I need to approximate the sum more carefully. Let's consider that arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3/6 + 3(k/n²)^5/40 + ...]. 

The first term is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = 1/2 + 1/(2n). 

The second term is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [ (n(n+1)/2)^2 ] / (6n⁶ ) = [n⁴/4 + ... ] / (6n⁶) ≈ 1/(24n²). 

The third term is sum_{k=1}^n 3k⁵/(40n^{10}) = 3/(40n^{10}) * sum_{k=1}^n k⁵ = 3/(40n^{10}) * n⁶/6 ≈ 3/(240n⁴) = 1/(80n⁴). 

So, as n approaches infinity, the higher-order terms vanish, and the sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²) + ... Therefore, the limit is indeed 1/2. 

Given all this, I think the correct answer is 1/2, and perhaps the mention of 2/3 in the problem statement is a mistake. Alternatively, if there was a different exponent or a different function, the answer would be different. 

Therefore, after careful consideration and multiple methods, the limit is 1/2.

To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}
\\]

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let me start by understanding what this expression means. The sum is taking the arcsin of each term k/n², where k goes from 1 to n, and then adding all those up. The question is about the behavior of this sum as n becomes very large.

First, I recall that when dealing with limits involving sums, especially as n approaches infinity, Riemann sums often come into play. A Riemann sum approximates an integral by dividing the interval into small parts and summing up the function values at specific points within each subinterval. So maybe I can relate this sum to an integral somehow.

But before jumping into that, let me think about the individual terms. For each k, the argument inside the arcsin function is k/n². Since k goes up to n, the maximum value of k/n² is n/n² = 1/n. So as n becomes large, the arguments of the arcsin functions become very small, approaching zero. I know that for small x, arcsin(x) is approximately equal to x. In fact, the Taylor series expansion of arcsin(x) around x=0 is x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So maybe I can approximate each term in the sum by k/n² and then sum those up, ignoring higher-order terms because they might become negligible as n grows.

If that's the case, then the sum would be approximately the sum from k=1 to n of k/n². Let's compute that sum. The sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2, so substituting that in, we get:

Sum ≈ (n(n+1)/2) / n² = (n² + n)/2n² = (1 + 1/n)/2.

As n approaches infinity, the 1/n term goes to zero, so the approximation would approach 1/2. But wait, the original problem states that the limit is 2/3. Hmm, that contradicts my approximation. Maybe the higher-order terms in the Taylor series of arcsin(x) contribute significantly, and I can't just ignore them?

Let me check the next term in the expansion. The next term after x is x³/6. So arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. So then, each term in the sum would be approximately k/n² + (k/n²)³ /6. Therefore, the total sum would be approximately the sum of k/n² plus the sum of k³/(6n⁶). Let's compute both parts.

First part: sum(k/n²) = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n² + n)/2n² = (1 + 1/n)/2 → 1/2 as n→infty.

Second part: sum(k³/(6n⁶)) = (1/(6n⁶)) * sum(k³). The sum of the first n cubes is [n(n+1)/2]^2. So:

sum(k³) = [n(n+1)/2]^2 = n²(n+1)²/4.

Therefore, the second part is (1/(6n⁶)) * n²(n+1)²/4 = (n²(n² + 2n + 1))/(24n⁶) = (n⁴ + 2n³ + n²)/(24n⁶) = (1/n² + 2/n³ + 1/n⁴)/24.

As n approaches infinity, all these terms go to zero. So the second part of the approximation tends to zero. Therefore, the total sum is approximately 1/2, but the problem states the limit is 2/3. There's a discrepancy here. So either my approximation is missing something, or maybe the initial approach is incorrect.

Wait, maybe the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is not accurate enough here. Let's consider the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to some small value. Alternatively, perhaps I should use a better approximation for arcsin(x) when x is small. Let's recall that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So up to the x³ term, maybe the next term is necessary. But in our case, x = k/n², so x³ = k³/n⁶. So the sum of x³ terms would be sum(k³)/n⁶, which we saw tends to zero. So even including that term, the sum still approaches 1/2. But the problem says the answer is 2/3. So perhaps my entire approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is that the sum isn't just a simple Riemann sum. Let's think again. If we have sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), and we want to approximate this as an integral. If n is large, then the terms k/n² are small, so the arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by k/n². Then the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (1/n²) * sum_{k=1}^n k = (1/n²)(n(n+1)/2) = (n+1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2 as n→infty. But the problem says the limit is 2/3. So clearly, there's something wrong here. Maybe the approximation is not valid?

Wait, maybe the problem is in the way we approximate the sum. Let's consider a Riemann sum. If we let x = k/n², then the step size Δx would be 1/n², but the sum is over k from 1 to n, so the points are x = 1/n², 2/n², ..., n/n² = 1/n. The width of each interval is Δx = 1/n², but the number of terms is n. So the total interval covered is from 0 to 1/n, but as n approaches infinity, the interval collapses to zero. So integrating from 0 to 0? That doesn't make sense. Maybe this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps we need to make a substitution. Let me set h = 1/n², so that k/n² = kh. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(kh). But as n approaches infinity, h approaches zero. However, the number of terms is n, which approaches infinity. So the sum is over a discrete set of points with spacing h, but h is going to zero. Wait, but the number of terms n is inversely proportional to h^(1/2) since h = 1/n², so n = 1/√h. Therefore, the sum is over points spaced at h, but the number of terms is 1/√h. Hmm, this seems like a Riemann sum where the number of intervals is increasing, but the width is decreasing. So maybe the sum can be approximated by an integral over a certain interval.

Wait, let's think of the sum as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(kh), where h = 1/n². Then, the sum is approximately the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) dx, but scaled by some factor. Wait, but the spacing between the points is h = 1/n², and the number of points is n. So the total interval covered is n * h = n * 1/n² = 1/n. So the integral would be from 0 to 1/n, but as n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0. However, integrating arcsin(x) from 0 to 0 is zero, which contradicts our previous result. So this approach is also not working.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is better approximated by an integral after a change of variables. Let me try to consider the sum as a Riemann sum for a different integral. Let's set x_k = k/n², so Δx = 1/n². Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k) * Δx^{-1} * Δx. Wait, no. Wait, actually, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k), where x_k = k/n². If we want to approximate this sum as an integral, we can think of it as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k) ≈ integral_{x=0}^{x=1/n} arcsin(x) * n² dx, since the spacing is 1/n², so the integral would be sum arcsin(x_k) * Δx = sum arcsin(x_k) * 1/n², but we have to multiply by n² to get the sum. Wait, that might not be straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe we can use the Euler-Maclaurin formula to approximate the sum. But that might be too complicated. Let me think again.

Wait, another idea: since the terms in the sum are small, maybe we can use the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 for each term. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n (k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6). Let's compute this.

First, sum(k/n²) = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2 as n→infty.

Second, sum((k/n²)^3 /6) = (1/6n⁶) sum(k³) = (1/6n⁶)(n²(n+1)^2/4) = (n²(n² + 2n + 1))/(24n⁶) = (1 + 2/n + 1/n²)/24. As n→infty, this approaches 1/24. So the total approximation would be 1/2 + 1/24 = 13/24 ≈ 0.5417, which is still less than 2/3. Hmm, not matching.

Wait, but the problem states the limit is 2/3. So maybe my approximation is missing something. Maybe higher-order terms are necessary? Let's check the next term in the Taylor expansion. The next term in arcsin(x) is 3x^5/40. So, including that, the sum would be sum(k/n² + k³/(6n⁶) + 3k^5/(40n^{10})).

But the sum of k^5 is a much higher power. The sum of k^5 is [n(n+1)/2]^5 / something, but even so, when divided by n^{10}, it would be [n^6/(2^5)] / n^{10} = 1/(32n^4), which goes to zero as n→infty. So those terms are negligible. So even adding that term, the sum still approaches 1/2 + 1/24 ≈ 13/24. Still not 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is not sufficient here. Perhaps we need a better approximation. Wait, but when x is very small, arcsin(x) is approximately x + x³/6, and higher terms are even smaller. So why is the limit 2/3?

Wait, perhaps there's a different approach. Let me consider the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let's try to bound S_n between two sums that are easier to evaluate.

Since arcsin(x) is an increasing function, and for x ≥ 0, arcsin(x) ≤ x + x³/6. Wait, actually, for x ≥ 0, arcsin(x) ≤ x + x³. Wait, no. Let me check the Taylor series: arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x^5/40 + ..., so it's indeed approximately x + x³/6 for small x. So perhaps arcsin(x) ≤ x + x³/6 for x ≥ 0. If that's the case, then S_n ≤ sum_{k=1}^n (k/n² + k³/(6n^6)). We already saw that the sum of k/n² is approximately 1/2, and the sum of k³/(6n^6) tends to zero. So S_n ≤ 1/2 + ε, where ε → 0. But the problem states the limit is 2/3. So this contradicts. Therefore, my upper bound is not tight enough.

Alternatively, maybe the lower bound. Since arcsin(x) ≥ x for x ≥ 0. So S_n ≥ sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² ≈ 1/2. So we have 1/2 ≤ S_n ≤ 1/2 + something that tends to zero. But the problem says the limit is 2/3, so this approach isn't working. Maybe I need to consider a different method.

Wait, perhaps instead of approximating each term, I should consider the entire sum and relate it to an integral. Let's try to model the sum as an integral. Let's set x = k/n². Then, k = xn², and the spacing between consecutive k's is Δk = 1. Therefore, Δx = Δk/n² = 1/n². However, the sum is over k from 1 to n, so x ranges from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. So the sum is over x from 0 to 1/n, with spacing Δx = 1/n². So the total sum S_n is approximately the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) / Δx dx. Wait, that is, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k) ≈ integral_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) / Δx dx. But Δx = 1/n², so this would be n² integral_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Let's compute that.

Compute the integral ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Let's integrate by parts. Let u = arcsin(x), dv = dx. Then du = 1/√(1 - x²) dx, v = x. So ∫ arcsin(x) dx = x arcsin(x) - ∫ x / √(1 - x²) dx. The integral ∫ x / √(1 - x²) dx = -√(1 - x²) + C. Therefore, ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx = [x arcsin(x) + √(1 - x²)] from 0 to 1/n.

Evaluating at upper limit 1/n: (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - (1/n)²).

Evaluating at lower limit 0: 0 + √1 = 1.

So the integral is (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - 1/n²) - 1.

Therefore, n² times this integral is n² [ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ].

Simplify each term:

First term: n² * (1/n) arcsin(1/n) = n arcsin(1/n).

Second term: n² [√(1 - 1/n²) - 1] = n² [√((n² - 1)/n²) - 1] = n² [√(n² - 1)/n - 1] = n² [ ( √(n² - 1) - n ) / n ].

Let's compute √(n² - 1) - n. Multiply numerator and denominator by √(n² - 1) + n:

( (√(n² - 1) - n)(√(n² - 1) + n) ) / (√(n² - 1) + n) ) = (n² - 1 - n²) / (√(n² - 1) + n) ) = (-1)/(√(n² - 1) + n).

Therefore, the second term becomes n² * [ (-1)/(√(n² - 1) + n) ) / n ] = -n² / [n(√(n² - 1) + n) ] = -n / ( √(n² - 1) + n ).

Divide numerator and denominator by n:

= -1 / ( √(1 - 1/n²) + 1 ).

As n approaches infinity, √(1 - 1/n²) approaches 1, so this term approaches -1/(1 + 1) = -1/2.

Now, the first term: n arcsin(1/n). As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3 /6. Therefore, n arcsin(1/n) ≈ n(1/n + 1/(6n³)) = 1 + 1/(6n²). Which tends to 1 as n→infty.

Therefore, putting it all together, the expression n² ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx ≈ [1 + 1/(6n²)] + [ -1/2 - 1/(2n²) ] = 1 - 1/2 + (1/(6n²) - 1/(2n²)) = 1/2 - 1/(3n²). As n→infty, this tends to 1/2. But the problem states the limit is 2/3. Wait, so again, we get 1/2, but the problem says 2/3. There must be a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps my initial assumption that the sum can be approximated by the integral is wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). If I model this as a Riemann sum, the standard approach is to have the sum be sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k) Δx, where Δx is the width of each interval. However, in our case, the term arcsin(k/n²) is not multiplied by Δx. So if we wanted a Riemann sum, we would have to write it as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) * Δx, but here Δx is 1/n², so the sum would be (n²) * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) * Δx. But that's not the case here. The problem is just the sum of arcsin(k/n²). So maybe my integral approach is not directly applicable.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) and relate it to the integral of arcsin(x) over a certain interval, scaled appropriately. Let me try to see.

Suppose we set x = k/n², then as n approaches infinity, the points x = 1/n², 2/n², ..., n/n² = 1/n become dense in the interval [0, 1/n]. However, integrating over [0, 1/n] would give a very small area. But the problem is that we have a sum over n points each of which is arcsin(k/n²). If we consider that for large n, the sum is approximately equal to the integral over [0, 1/n] of arcsin(x) multiplied by n², which is the number of points. Wait, that's similar to what I did before. But that gave me 1/2, conflicting with the problem's answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's another way to approximate the sum. Let's consider that for large n, the sum S_n can be approximated by an integral from x=0 to x=1 of arcsin(x/n²) dx, but scaled by n. Wait, that might not make sense. Alternatively, perhaps a substitution.

Let me set t = k/n. Then, k = tn, and the term becomes arcsin(tn / n²) = arcsin(t/n). Then, the sum S_n = sum_{t=1/n, 2/n, ...,1} arcsin(t/n). The spacing between t's is 1/n. So the sum is approximately n * ∫₀¹ arcsin(t/n) dt. Wait, but as n→infty, t/n →0, so arcsin(t/n) ≈ t/n + (t/n)^3 /6. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (t/n + t³/(6n³)) dt = [t²/(2n) + t⁴/(24n³)] from 0 to1 = 1/(2n) + 1/(24n³). So multiplying by n gives n*(1/(2n) + 1/(24n³)) = 1/2 + 1/(24n²), which tends to 1/2 as n→infty. Again, conflicting with the problem's answer of 2/3.

Wait a minute, the problem says the limit is 2/3, but all my approximations give 1/2. Maybe the problem is stated incorrectly, or perhaps I'm missing something. Let me double-check the problem statement.

The problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). The user also mentions that the limit is 2/3. But according to my calculations, it's approaching 1/2. Maybe there's a mistake in my approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is too crude here. Let's consider higher-order terms. Let me compute the next term in the expansion. So arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x^5/40 + ... So sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n^6) + 3k^5/(40n^{10}) + ...].

We already saw that the sum of k/n² is approximately 1/2, and the sum of k³/(6n^6) tends to zero. But maybe the next term contributes? Let's compute sum_{k=1}^n 3k^5/(40n^{10}).

Sum of k^5 is [n(n+1)/2]^5 / something. Wait, the exact formula for the sum of k^5 from k=1 to n is n²(n+1)^2(2n² + 2n -1)/12. But regardless, when we divide by 40n^{10}, it becomes something like n^10 / 40n^{10} = 1/40, but with coefficients. However, the exact coefficient would be (sum of k^5)/n^{10} ≈ (n^6)/n^{10} = 1/n^4, which tends to zero. So the higher-order terms do not contribute. Therefore, even with higher terms, the sum approaches 1/2, not 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider that the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is not valid for all k, but only for some. However, since k goes up to n, and the argument is k/n², the maximum argument is 1/n, which tends to zero. So all terms are in the region where x is small, and the approximation should hold.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question, and the limit is indeed 2/3, but I need to find a different approach. Let me think.

Wait, another idea: maybe use the fact that arcsin(x) = ∫₀^x 1/√(1 - t²) dt. So then, the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n ∫₀^{k/n²} 1/√(1 - t²) dt. Interchanging sum and integral (if allowed), we get ∫₀^{1/n} 1/√(1 - t²) * sum_{k=1}^n χ_{[0, k/n²]}(t) dt, where χ is the characteristic function. But sum_{k=1}^n χ_{[0, k/n²]}(t) is the number of k's such that 0 ≤ t ≤ k/n². For a fixed t, the number of k's is the number of integers k with k ≥ t n². Since k ranges from 1 to n, the number of k's is max(0, n - floor(t n²)). But this seems complicated to handle.

Alternatively, approximate the sum as an integral. Let's set t = k/n². Then, the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(t). The spacing between t's is Δt = 1/n². The number of terms is n = 1/√Δt. So the sum can be approximated by ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(t) / Δt dt. Wait, similar to before. Which we saw tends to 1/2. So again, conflicting with the problem's answer.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, and the intended limit is 1/2, but the user wrote 2/3. Or perhaps the sum is from k=1 to n², but no, the problem says k=1 to n.

Wait, let me check again. The problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). The user also mentions that the limit is 2/3. But according to all my calculations, it should be 1/2. Maybe I made a mistake in my integral approach.

Wait, let's recast the problem. Let me set h = 1/n², then the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(kh). The number of terms is n = 1/√h. So the sum is over points spaced by h, from h to n h = 1/√h * h = 1/√h. Wait, no, k goes from 1 to n, so x = k h, where x ranges from h to n h = h n = 1/√h * h = 1/√h. Wait, but as n approaches infinity, h approaches zero, so x ranges up to 1/√h, which also approaches infinity. Wait, that can't be. Wait, no. If h = 1/n², then n h = n /n² = 1/n, which approaches zero. So x ranges from h to n h = 1/n. So as n approaches infinity, the interval from 0 to 0. So integrating over zero? That's confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the sum is better approximated by an integral over x from 0 to 1, but scaled in some way. Let me think.

Suppose I set x = k/n. Then, k = xn, and the term becomes arcsin(x/n). But then, the sum S_n = sum_{x=1/n, 2/n, ...,1} arcsin(x/n). The spacing between x's is 1/n. So the sum is approximately n ∫₀¹ arcsin(x/n) dx. As n approaches infinity, x/n approaches zero, so arcsin(x/n) ≈ x/n + (x/n)^3 /6. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (x/n + x³/(6n³)) dx = [x²/(2n) + x⁴/(24n³)] from 0 to1 = 1/(2n) + 1/(24n³). Multiplying by n gives n*(1/(2n) + 1/(24n³)) = 1/2 + 1/(24n²), which approaches 1/2. Again, conflicting with the problem's answer.

Hmm. Given that all methods point to 1/2, but the problem states 2/3, perhaps there's an error in the problem statement, or maybe I'm missing a key insight.

Wait, let me try another approach. Maybe using the mean value theorem for sums. The sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me approximate this sum by an integral. Let's set x = k/n², so the step in x is Δx = 1/n². The sum S_n is then approximately equal to the integral from x=0 to x=1/n of arcsin(x) / Δx dx = n² ∫₀^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Wait, this is the same as before. And we saw that this integral tends to 1/2. So again, 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different substitution. Let's set t = k/n. Then, k = tn, and the term becomes arcsin(tn /n²) = arcsin(t/n). Then, the sum S_n = sum_{t=1/n, 2/n, ...,1} arcsin(t/n). The spacing between t's is 1/n. So the sum is approximately n ∫₀¹ arcsin(t/n) dt. As n→infty, t/n →0, so arcsin(t/n) ≈ t/n + (t/n)^3 /6. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ (t/n + t³/(6n³)) dt = [t²/(2n) + t⁴/(24n³)] from 0 to1 = 1/(2n) + 1/(24n³). Multiplying by n gives 1/2 + 1/(24n²), so again, S_n approaches 1/2.

At this point, I'm consistently getting 1/2, but the problem claims the limit is 2/3. There must be a disconnect here. Maybe the problem was misstated, or perhaps the original problem has a different expression.

Alternatively, maybe the sum is from k=1 to n², but that's not what's written. Let me check again: the problem states sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). So unless there's a miscalculation in my steps, which I haven't found, the answer should be 1/2. But the user mentions the answer is 2/3. Perhaps I need to re-examine the problem.

Wait, maybe the original problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), and the answer is 2/3. Let me try to compute the sum numerically for a large n and see. Let's take n=1000. Then, the sum would be sum_{k=1}^{1000} arcsin(k/1000000). Since k/1000000 is very small, arcsin(k/1000000) ≈ k/1000000 + (k/1000000)^3 /6. The sum of k/1000000 is (1000*1001)/2 /1000000 = (500500)/1000000 = 0.5005. The sum of (k/1000000)^3 /6 is sum_{k=1}^{1000} k³/(6*10^18). The sum of k³ from 1 to 1000 is (1000*1001/2)^2 = (500500)^2 = 250500250000. Then, dividing by 6*10^18 gives 250500250000/(6*10^18) ≈ 4.175e-10. So the total sum would be approximately 0.5005 + 4.175e-10 ≈ 0.5005. Which is close to 0.5, not 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), but that would be different. Or perhaps arcsin(k/n³). If the problem were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n³), then the argument is k/n³, and the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n k/n³ ≈ n(n+1)/2 /n³ ≈ 1/(2n) →0. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(n/k), but that would be a different expression. Wait, no, the problem is as stated.

Given that all analytical approaches and numerical estimation suggest the limit is 1/2, but the problem states it's 2/3, there must be an error either in my reasoning or in the problem's statement. Given that the user provided the problem and the expected answer, perhaps I missed a key insight.

Wait, let me consider the following. Suppose we approximate arcsin(x) ≈ x for small x, but then the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2. But maybe there's a different approximation for arcsin(x) that's more accurate in this context.

Wait, another idea: use the identity that arcsin(x) = ∫₀^x 1/√(1 - t²) dt. So then, the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n ∫₀^{k/n²} 1/√(1 - t²) dt. If we interchange the sum and the integral, we get ∫₀^{1/n} 1/√(1 - t²) * sum_{k=1}^n χ_{[0, k/n²]}(t) dt. The sum χ_{[0, k/n²]}(t) is the number of k's such that k/n² ≥ t. For a fixed t, the number of k's is the number of integers k with k ≥ t n². Since k ranges from 1 to n, the number of such k's is max(0, n - floor(t n²)). However, for t in [0, 1/n], t n² ranges from 0 to n. So the number of k's is n - floor(t n²). Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀^{1/n} 1/√(1 - t²) * (n - floor(t n²)) dt.

Approximating floor(t n²) ≈ t n², since t n² is between 0 and n. So the integral becomes ∫₀^{1/n} 1/√(1 - t²) * (n - t n²) dt = n ∫₀^{1/n} 1/√(1 - t²) dt - n² ∫₀^{1/n} t /√(1 - t²) dt.

Compute the first integral: ∫₀^{1/n} 1/√(1 - t²) dt = arcsin(t) |₀^{1/n} = arcsin(1/n) - arcsin(0) = arcsin(1/n).

The second integral: ∫₀^{1/n} t /√(1 - t²) dt. Let u = 1 - t², du = -2t dt. So -1/2 ∫ du /√u = -√u + C. Evaluated from t=0 to t=1/n: -√(1 - (1/n)^2) + √1 = -√(1 - 1/n²) + 1.

Therefore, the integral becomes:

n arcsin(1/n) - n² [ -√(1 - 1/n²) + 1 ].

Simplify:

n arcsin(1/n) + n² √(1 - 1/n²) - n².

As n approaches infinity, arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + 1/(6n³), so n arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1 + 1/(6n²).

√(1 - 1/n²) = √(n² - 1)/n = [n √(1 - 1/n²)] ≈ n (1 - 1/(2n²)) = n - 1/(2n). Wait, no. Let me expand √(1 - 1/n²) using Taylor series: √(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8 - ... for small x. So √(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²) - 1/(8n⁴) - ... Therefore, n² √(1 - 1/n²) ≈ n² [1 - 1/(2n²) - 1/(8n⁴)] = n² - 1/2 - 1/(8n²).

Therefore, the expression becomes:

[1 + 1/(6n²)] + [n² - 1/2 - 1/(8n²)] - n² = 1 + 1/(6n²) - 1/2 - 1/(8n²) = 1/2 + (1/6 - 1/8)/n² = 1/2 + (1/24)/n².

As n approaches infinity, this tends to 1/2. So again, the limit is 1/2, conflicting with the problem's answer.

Given that all methods consistently give 1/2, and the problem states the limit is 2/3, I suspect there might be a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a different expression, such as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n) or sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n³), which might yield a different limit. However, based on the given problem, the limit should be 1/2.

But since the user specifies the answer is 2/3, maybe I need to check once more for any miscalculations.

Wait, another idea: perhaps the sum is from k=1 to n², but that's not what's stated. If it were sum_{k=1}^{n²} arcsin(k/n²), then the sum would be approximated by the integral ∫₀^{n²} arcsin(x/n²) dx. Let's compute that. Let t = x/n², then dx = n² dt. The integral becomes n² ∫₀¹ arcsin(t) dt. The integral of arcsin(t) from 0 to1 is [t arcsin(t) + √(1 - t²)] from0 to1 = (1*(π/2) + 0) - 0 = π/2. So the integral would be n² * π/2, which goes to infinity. But the problem states the limit is 2/3, so that's not it.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(n/k). But that would be different. Let me check the original problem again.

The problem is: Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). The user also mentions the answer is 2/3. But according to all my calculations, it's 1/2. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation I'm not seeing, the answer should be 1/2. However, the user's problem might have a typo. Alternatively, maybe the sum is from k=1 to n², but that's speculative.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is intended to use a different approximation for arcsin(x). Wait, let's consider integrating by parts. Suppose S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me consider each term arcsin(k/n²). If I set x_k = k/n², then the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k).

But integrating by parts over the sum is not straightforward. Alternatively, use the identity that arcsin(x) = ∫₀^x 1/√(1 - t²) dt. Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n ∫₀^{k/n²} 1/√(1 - t²) dt. Interchanging sum and integral (under suitable conditions), we get ∫₀^{1/n} 1/√(1 - t²) * sum_{k=1}^n χ_{[0, k/n²]}(t) dt. The inner sum is the number of k's such that k/n² ≥ t, which is the number of k's with k ≥ t n². Since k ranges from 1 to n, the number is n - floor(t n²). For t in [0, 1/n], t n² ranges from 0 to n. Therefore, for t < 1/n², the number of k's is n. For t between 1/n² and 1/n, the number of k's decreases by 1 each time t crosses k/n².

But integrating from 0 to 1/n, the function sum_{k=1}^n χ_{[0, k/n²]}(t) is a step function that starts at n when t=0, decreases by 1 at each t = k/n² for k=1 to n. Therefore, the integral becomes the sum over k=1 to n of ∫_{(k-1)/n²}^{k/n²} 1/√(1 - t²) * (n - (k-1)) dt. Wait, this seems complicated, but maybe approximate it.

For small t, 1/√(1 - t²) ≈ 1 + t²/2. So the integral over each interval [ (k-1)/n², k/n² ] is approximately ∫_{(k-1)/n²}^{k/n²} [1 + t²/2] (n - (k-1)) dt. Let's compute this.

First, the integral of 1 over [a, b] is (b - a) = 1/n².

Second, the integral of t²/2 over [a, b] is (1/2)(b³/3 - a³/3) = (1/6)(b³ - a³).

Therefore, the integral over each interval is approximately (n - (k-1)) [1/n² + (1/6)( (k/n²)^3 - ((k-1)/n²)^3 ) ].

Simplify:

= (n - k + 1)/n² + (n - k + 1)/6n⁶ [k³ - (k-1)^3].

Compute k³ - (k-1)^3 = 3k² - 3k +1. So:

= (n - k + 1)/n² + (n - k +1)(3k² - 3k +1)/(6n⁶).

Summing over k=1 to n:

Sum_{k=1}^n (n - k +1)/n² + Sum_{k=1}^n (n - k +1)(3k² -3k +1)/(6n⁶).

First sum: Sum_{k=1}^n (n -k +1)/n² = Sum_{m=1}^n m/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) ≈ 1/2.

Second sum: Sum_{k=1}^n (n -k +1)(3k² -3k +1)/(6n⁶).

Let's approximate this sum for large n. The term (n -k +1) ≈ n -k, and 3k² -3k +1 ≈ 3k². So the sum is approximately Sum_{k=1}^n (n -k)(3k²)/(6n⁶) = (3/6n⁶) Sum_{k=1}^n (n -k)k² = (1/2n⁶) Sum_{k=1}^n (n k² -k³).

Compute Sum_{k=1}^n n k² = n * n(n+1)(2n+1)/6 ≈ n * n * 2n² /6 = n^4/3.

Sum_{k=1}^n k³ = [n(n+1)/2]^2 ≈ n^4/4.

Therefore, the sum is approximately (1/2n⁶)(n^4/3 - n^4/4) = (1/2n⁶)(n^4/12) = 1/(24n²). Which tends to zero as n→infty.

Therefore, the total approximation is 1/2 + 0 = 1/2. Again, conflicting with the problem's answer.

Given that all approaches lead to 1/2, and the problem states the answer is 2/3, I think there must be a mistake in the problem statement. However, assuming the problem is correct, and the answer is 2/3, I need to find another way.

Wait, perhaps the original problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), and the answer is 2/3. Let me check that case. If the sum were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), then as n→infty, the terms arcsin(k/n) would be arcsin(x) where x ranges from 1/n to 1. But this is a different problem. However, if the user mistyped k/n² as k/n, then maybe the answer is 2/3. But given the problem as stated, I don't see a way to get 2/3.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n, but that's not the case here.

Given the information, I think the correct answer is 1/2, and the problem statement might have an error. However, since the user insists the answer is 2/3, perhaps they want a different approach.

Wait, another idea: use the fact that for small x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6, and sum_{k=1}^n (k/n² + k³/(6n^6)) = sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n^6). We already saw that the first sum is approximately 1/2, and the second sum is approximately 1/24. So total is 13/24 ≈ 0.5417. Still not 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n, but that would be n times sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ n*(1/2) → infinity. No.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by something else. But as per the problem, it's just the sum.

Given all this, I think there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps the answer provided is incorrect. However, based on the calculations, the limit should be 1/2.

But since the user mentioned the answer is 2/3, maybe I need to check once again for any possible miscalculations.

Wait, let's try to compute the sum for a specific large n numerically. For example, take n=1000. Compute sum_{k=1}^{1000} arcsin(k/1000000). Since k/1000000 is very small, arcsin(k/1000000) ≈ k/1000000 + (k/1000000)^3 /6. The sum of k/1000000 is (1000*1001)/2 /1000000 = (500500)/1000000 = 0.5005. The sum of (k/1000000)^3 /6 is sum k³/(6*10^18). The sum of k³ from 1 to 1000 is (1000*1001/2)^2 = (500500)^2 = 250500250000. Divided by 6*10^18 gives 250500250000/(6*10^18) ≈ 4.175e-10. So total sum ≈ 0.5005 + 4.175e-10 ≈ 0.5005. Which is close to 0.5, not 2/3.

Therefore, all evidence suggests the limit is 1/2. The problem's answer of 2/3 must be incorrect. However, since the user has provided that the answer is 2/3, perhaps there's a misinterpretation of the problem. Alternatively, maybe the original problem has a different expression, such as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{3/2}), but that's speculative.

In conclusion, based on the problem as stated, the limit is 1/2. There might be an error in the problem statement or the provided answer.

**Final Answer**

To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}
\\]

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

Additionally, we verified using integral comparison. The integral \\(\\int_{0}^{n} \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{x}{n^2}\\right) \\, dx\\) was evaluated and found to approach \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\) as \\(n \\to \\infty\\), confirming our result.

Thus, the limit is:

\\[
\\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let's break this down. First, I remember that arcsin(x) is the inverse sine function, which gives an angle whose sine is x. But here, the argument inside the arcsin is k divided by n². Since n is going to infinity, and k is up to n, let's see what happens to k/n² as n gets large.

For each term in the sum, when n is very large, k can be at most n, so k/n² is at most n/n² = 1/n. As n goes to infinity, 1/n approaches 0. So for each term in the sum, the argument of arcsin is approaching 0. Maybe I can use the approximation of arcsin(x) for small x. I recall that for small x, arcsin(x) is approximately x + (x³)/6 + ... So maybe I can approximate each term in the sum by x here, which would be k/n², and then sum those up?

Let me check that. If x is near 0, then arcsin(x) ≈ x + (1/6)x³ + higher order terms. Since x here is k/n², which is small for large n, maybe the higher order terms like x³ will be negligible when summed over k from 1 to n. So perhaps the sum is approximately equal to the sum of k/n² from k=1 to n. Let's compute that sum.

The sum of k from 1 to n is n(n+1)/2. So the sum of k/n² would be (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) = (1 + 1/n)/2. As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so this sum approaches 1/2. But wait, the original problem has arcsin(k/n²) instead of k/n². So if we approximate arcsin(k/n²) by k/n², then the sum would approach 1/2. But the problem is presented as having the answer 2/3, so maybe my initial approximation is missing something.

Alternatively, maybe the higher order terms in the Taylor series expansion of arcsin(x) contribute to the limit. Let's go back. The expansion of arcsin(x) around 0 is x + (1/6)x³ + (3/40)x⁵ + ... So if we take the sum from k=1 to n of [x + (1/6)x³ + ...], then the total sum would be the sum of x terms plus the sum of (1/6)x³ terms, etc.

So let's compute the first term sum: sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²) = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) → 1/2 as n→∞.

Now the next term is (1/6) sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3 = (1/6) sum_{k=1}^n k³/n⁶. The sum of k³ from 1 to n is [n(n+1)/2]^2. So substituting that in, we get (1/6) * [n²(n+1)^2 / 4] / n⁶ = (1/6) * (n²(n² + 2n + 1)/4n⁶) = (1/24) * (1 + 2/n + 1/n²)/n². As n→∞, this becomes (1/24)(1)/n² → 0. So the next term tends to 0. Similarly, higher order terms would also vanish as n→∞.

Therefore, the leading term is 1/2, and the higher-order terms vanish. But the problem states the answer is 2/3, which contradicts my calculation. Maybe my initial approximation is wrong?

Wait, perhaps the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is too crude here. Maybe I need a better approximation for the sum. Let me think again. Alternatively, maybe I can use integral approximation. Since the sum is from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²), perhaps approximate this sum by an integral. Let's see. If we consider k as a variable from 1 to n, and n is large, then k/n² is like x = k/n², so maybe changing variables to x. But k ranges from 1 to n, so x ranges from 1/n² to 1/n. Hmm, but 1/n² is very small. Alternatively, maybe approximate the sum as an integral over x from 0 to 1/n, with x = k/n², but that seems tricky.

Alternatively, think of the sum as a Riemann sum. Let me consider dividing the interval [0,1] into n equal parts, but here the variable is k/n². Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, consider the sum as a Riemann sum for the integral of arcsin(t) from t=0 to t=1/n. But the sum is over k from 1 to n, so each term is arcsin(k/n²). If we let t_k = k/n², then the sum is the sum of arcsin(t_k) where t_k = k/n². But the spacing between t_k is 1/n². So the sum is similar to a Riemann sum with Δt = 1/n². But the integral would be from t=0 to t=1, but here t goes up to n/n² = 1/n. So as n→∞, the upper limit of the integral approaches 0. So maybe the integral approximation isn't straightforward here.

Alternatively, maybe consider expanding arcsin(k/n²) using a Taylor series around 0. So arcsin(x) ≈ x + (1/6)x³ + (3/40)x⁵ + ... So sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (1/6)(k/n²)^3 + ...]. Then the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + (1/6) sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3 + ... As before, the first sum is (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) → 1/2. The second sum is (1/6)(sum_{k=1}^n k³)/n⁶. The sum of k³ is [n(n+1)/2]^2, so substituting gives (1/6)(n²(n+1)^2 / 4)/n⁶ = (1/24)(1 + 2/n + 1/n²)/n² → 0 as n→∞. Similarly, higher order terms are even smaller. So the total sum should approach 1/2. But the problem states the answer is 2/3, which is different.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the approximation. Let me check again. If arcsin(x) ≈ x + (1/6)x³, then the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n (k/n² + (1/6)(k/n²)^3). Then the first term is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) → 1/2. The second term is (1/6) sum_{k=1}^n k³/n⁶. The sum of k³ is [n(n+1)/2]^2, so substituting gives (1/6)(n²(n+1)^2 /4)/n⁶ = (1/24)(1 + 2/n + 1/n²)/n². As n→∞, this becomes (1/24)(1)/n² → 0. So the second term is negligible. Therefore, the sum approaches 1/2. But the problem says 2/3. Hmm, maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I need to use a better approximation for arcsin(x). Let me recall that for small x, arcsin(x) = x + (1/6)x³ + (3/40)x⁵ + ... So maybe the approximation is okay, but the problem might be that when we sum over k from 1 to n, the higher order terms might accumulate? Wait, but even if each term is small, the sum of the cubic terms would be sum_{k=1}^n (k³/n⁶) = [n(n+1)/2]^2 / n⁶ = (n² + 2n + 1)/4n⁴. So (1 + 2/n + 1/n²)/4n². Then multiplied by 1/6, it's (1 + 2/n + 1/n²)/24n², which still tends to 0 as n→∞. So the higher terms vanish.

Alternatively, maybe the initial approximation is missing something. Let me check with actual numbers. Suppose n is very large, say n=1000. Then for each k from 1 to 1000, k/n² is from 1/1,000,000 to 1,000/1,000,000 = 0.001. So x ranges from 0.000001 to 0.001. So these are very small. Then arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. So the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n x + sum_{k=1}^n x³/6. The first sum is approximately 1/2, and the second sum is approximately (1/6)(sum k³)/n⁶. For n=1000, sum k³ is approximately (1000)^4 / 4 = 2.5*10^11. Divided by n⁶ (10^18), that's 2.5*10^11 / 10^18 = 2.5*10^-7. Multiply by 1/6, gives about 4*10^-8. So negligible. So even for n=1000, the second term is tiny. Therefore, the sum is approximately 1/2. But the problem states the answer is 2/3. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to reconsider the problem. The problem is written as \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) = \\frac{2}{3}. So according to the problem, the answer is 2/3, but according to my calculations, it's 1/2. Maybe I made a mistake in the approximation. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is not valid here because when summed over k, the error terms might add up. Let me consider the difference between arcsin(x) and x. For x in [0, 1/n], the difference arcsin(x) - x is approximately x³/6. So the sum of arcsin(x) - x is approximately sum_{k=1}^n x³/6. But as I saw before, that sum is negligible. So why does the problem say 2/3?

Wait, maybe the problem was mistyped? Or maybe I misread it. Let me check again. The problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). The user wrote that the answer is 2/3. So perhaps my approach is wrong.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to approach this sum. Let me think. If we let x_k = k/n², then the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k). If n is large, then x_k ranges from 1/n² to 1/n. But 1/n is still going to 0 as n→∞. So maybe we can approximate arcsin(x_k) ≈ x_k + x_k³/6, but even then, the sum of x_k³/6 is small.

Alternatively, maybe use an integral approximation for the sum. Let me consider that sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ n * average value of arcsin(x) over x from 1/n² to 1/n. But as n→∞, the interval [1/n², 1/n] becomes very small. So the average value of arcsin(x) over that interval is approximately arcsin(0) + something, but arcsin(0) is 0. Wait, but 1/n² is approaching 0, so the interval is approaching 0. Maybe we can approximate the sum by n times the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to 1/n. But since the interval is small, perhaps the integral is approximately arcsin(0) * (1/n - 0) = 0. But that can't be, since the sum is not zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe consider the sum as a Riemann sum. Let me set x = k/n², so k = x n². Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x) where x = k/n². If we let Δx = 1/n², then the sum is approximately ∫_{1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(x) / Δx dx. Wait, but in a Riemann sum, the sum is approximately ∫ arcsin(x) dx over the interval, multiplied by the number of terms. Wait, perhaps not exactly. Let me think again.

If we have sum_{k=1}^n f(x_k) Δx, that approximates ∫ f(x) dx. But here, x_k = k/n², and Δx = 1/n². So sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k) Δx ≈ ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. But the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k) = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = (sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²)) * Δx / Δx. So if we let S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), then S ≈ ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) / Δx dx = ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) * n² dx. So S ≈ n² ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx.

So compute the integral ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Let's integrate by parts. Let u = arcsin(x), dv = dx. Then du = 1/√(1 - x²) dx, v = x. So uv - ∫ v du = x arcsin(x) - ∫ x / √(1 - x²) dx. The integral becomes x arcsin(x) + √(1 - x²) + C. Evaluated from 0 to 1/n:

At upper limit 1/n: (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - (1/n)^2)

At lower limit 0: 0 + √1 = 1

So the integral is [(1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - 1/n²)] - 1

Therefore, S ≈ n² [ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ]

Simplify each term:

First term: n² * (1/n) arcsin(1/n) = n arcsin(1/n)

Second term: n² [ √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ]

So S ≈ n arcsin(1/n) + n² [ √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ]

Let's evaluate each part as n→∞.

First, arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3 /6 + ... So n arcsin(1/n) ≈ n*(1/n + (1/n)^3 /6) = 1 + (1/(6n²)) → 1 as n→∞.

Second term: n² [ √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ].

Expand √(1 - 1/n²) using Taylor series: √(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8 - ... So here x = 1/n². Thus,

√(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - (1/(2n²)) - (1/(8n⁴)) - ...

Subtract 1: -1/(2n²) - 1/(8n⁴) - ...

Multiply by n²: -1/2 - 1/(8n²) - ... → -1/2 as n→∞.

So combining both terms: S ≈ [1 + 1/(6n²)] + [-1/2 - 1/(8n²)] = 1 - 1/2 + (1/(6n²) - 1/(8n²)) = 1/2 - (1/(24n²)) → 1/2 as n→∞.

Wait, so this also leads to the conclusion that the limit is 1/2, but the problem states it's 2/3. There must be an error in my reasoning. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is different. Wait, let me check the original problem again.

The problem is: Evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²), and the answer is given as 2/3. But according to both the direct summation approximation and the integral approximation, I get 1/2. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe the problem was mistyped? Or perhaps I made a miscalculation in one of the steps.

Wait, let me check the integral approximation again. So I approximated the sum by n² times the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to 1/n. Then computed that integral, and got S ≈ n arcsin(1/n) + n² [√(1 - 1/n²) - 1]. Then expanding that gives S ≈ 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem was meant to have arcsin(k/n²) summed from k=1 to n², but that would be different. Or perhaps the argument is k/n instead of k/n². If it were k/n, then as n→∞, the argument would approach 1, and the sum would be different. But according to the problem, it's k/n².

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me consider that for each term, arcsin(k/n²) can be approximated by k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3 /6. The first sum is (n+1)/(2n) → 1/2. The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/n⁶ /6. The sum of k³ is [n(n+1)/2]^2, so divided by n⁶ gives (n² + 2n +1)/4n⁴ = (1 + 2/n +1/n²)/4n². Multiply by 1/6 gives (1 + 2/n +1/n²)/24n² → 0. So again, total sum approaches 1/2. So why does the problem say 2/3?

Wait, maybe I need to check my math again. Let's compute the sum S = sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (1/n²) sum_{k=1}^n k = (1/n²)(n(n+1)/2) = (n+1)/(2n) = (1 + 1/n)/2 → 1/2 as n→∞. Correct.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and it should be arcsin(k/n) instead of arcsin(k/n²). If that were the case, then the argument k/n ranges from 1/n to 1, which doesn't go to 0. Then we would need a different approach. But according to the problem, it's k/n².

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's answer. If the answer is 2/3, then perhaps the original problem was different. For example, if instead of arcsin(k/n²), it was arcsin(k/n), then the limit would be different. Let me check that quickly.

If the problem were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), then as n→∞, each term arcsin(k/n) would approach arcsin(0) when k/n approaches 0, but for large k, say k ~ cn, then arcsin(c) would be a constant. But in that case, the sum would not converge to a finite limit. So that can't be.

Alternatively, if the problem were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n, then the limit would be different. Let me compute that. If we have n * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ n*(1/2) = n/2, which goes to infinity. But the problem does not have that.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit as n→∞ of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n. Then, from my previous calculation, n * sum arcsin(k/n²) ≈ n*(1/2) → ∞. But the problem doesn't specify that.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to consider a different approximation. Let's consider that for small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + ...]. So the sum is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + (1/6) sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3 + ... As we saw, the first term is 1/2, and the second term is negligible. So the total sum approaches 1/2.

But the problem says 2/3. There must be some mistake here. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n. Let me check that.

If S = n * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), then S ≈ n*(1/2) → ∞. Not 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written as the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n³). Then, similar approach: for each term, k/n³ is very small, and the sum would be approximated by sum_{k=1}^n k/n³ = (n(n+1)/2)/n³ = (n+1)/(2n²) → 0. But that's not 2/3 either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit of n times the sum, but that leads to infinity. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that the initial approximation is not sufficient. Let's think again. The approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 is valid for small x, but perhaps when summed over many terms, even small higher-order terms can add up. Wait, but in our case, the sum of x³ terms is negligible. Let me compute it again.

Sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3 = sum_{k=1}^n k³/n⁶ = [n²(n+1)²/4]/n⁶ = (n² + 2n +1)/4n⁴ = (1 + 2/n +1/n²)/4n². So multiplied by 1/6, gives (1 + 2/n +1/n²)/24n². As n→∞, this is approximately 1/(24n²) → 0. So the sum of the cubic terms is negligible.

But the problem states the answer is 2/3. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider using the integral test or something else.

Alternatively, maybe consider that arcsin(x) ≈ x for small x, but with a different approximation. For example, using the expansion arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ..., but even then, the sum of the cubic terms is negligible. Alternatively, maybe there's a different series expansion.

Wait, perhaps the problem requires a different approach. Let me think again. Suppose I let x = k/n², so k = xn². Then the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{x=1/n²}^{1/n} arcsin(x) with Δx = 1/n². So the sum is approximately the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx divided by Δx. Wait, no, the Riemann sum is sum f(x_k) Δx ≈ ∫ f(x) dx. So sum f(x_k) ≈ ∫ f(x)/Δx dx. So S ≈ ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) / Δx dx = ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) * n² dx.

Which is what I did earlier, leading to S ≈ 1/2. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming the approximation. Let me compute the sum numerically for a large n and see.

Take n=1000. Compute sum_{k=1}^{1000} arcsin(k/(1000)^2). Let's approximate this sum. Since k ranges from 1 to 1000, and x = k/1,000,000, which is from 0.000001 to 0.001. So for each x, arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. So sum_{k=1}^{1000} [k/1,000,000 + (k/1,000,000)^3 /6]. The first sum is (1000*1001)/2 /1,000,000 = (1001000)/2,000,000 = 1001/2000 ≈ 0.5005. The second sum is (1/6) sum_{k=1}^{1000} (k^3)/(1,000,000^3) = (1/6)*( (1000*1001/2)^2 )/1e18 = (1/6)*( (1,001,000/2)^2 )/1e18. Compute 1,001,000/2 = 500,500. Squared is 250,500,250,000. Divided by 1e18 is 0.00025050025. Multiply by 1/6 gives ≈0.00004175. So total sum is approximately 0.5005 + 0.00004175 ≈0.50054. So about 0.5005, which is close to 1/2. So even for n=1000, the sum is approaching 1/2.

Therefore, the answer should be 1/2, but the problem states 2/3. There must be a mistake in the problem statement or perhaps in the given answer. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again.

The problem is: Evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²), and the answer is given as 2/3. But according to all my calculations, it's 1/2. Maybe the problem was supposed to be the sum of arcsin(k/n), but that would be different. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/(n² + n)) or some other denominator.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach using series expansion. Let me think again. Suppose I write arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... Then sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + 3(k/n²)^5 /40 + ...]. The first term sum is (n+1)/(2n) → 1/2. The second term sum is sum_{k=1}^n (k³/n⁶)/6 = (n²(n+1)^2 /4)/6n⁶ = (n+1)^2 /24n⁴ → 1/24n² → 0. Similarly, higher terms vanish. So total sum approaches 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and the correct answer is 1/2. But since the user provided the answer as 2/3, maybe there's a different line of thinking.

Wait, perhaps the problem involves a different approximation. Let me consider that for small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + ..., but when summed over k, maybe there's a different behavior. Alternatively, consider that the sum is similar to an integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx, but scaled by n². Wait, earlier calculation gave S ≈ 1/2. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in the integral calculation.

Wait, when I approximated the sum as n² times the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to 1/n, I got S ≈ 1/2. But maybe there's a mistake in that approach. Let me re-examine the steps.

We set x = k/n², so k = xn², and Δx = 1/n². The sum S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x) where x ranges from 1/n² to 1/n. The Riemann sum approximation is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k) = n² ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Then, compute the integral:

∫ arcsin(x) dx = x arcsin(x) + √(1 - x²) + C.

Evaluated from 0 to 1/n:

[(1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - (1/n)^2)] - [0 + √1] = (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - 1/n²) - 1.

Multiply by n²:

n² [ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ] = n arcsin(1/n) + n² [ √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ].

As n→∞, arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3 /6, so n arcsin(1/n) ≈ n*(1/n + 1/(6n³)) = 1 + 1/(6n²) → 1.

For the second term: n² [ √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ].

Expand √(1 - 1/n²) using Taylor series: √(1 - x) ≈ 1 - x/2 - x²/8 - x³/16 - ..., so:

√(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - (1/(2n²)) - (1/(8n⁴)) - ... 

Subtract 1: -1/(2n²) - 1/(8n⁴) - ...

Multiply by n²: -1/2 - 1/(8n²) - ... → -1/2 as n→∞.

Thus, total S ≈ 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. So again, the result is 1/2.

Given that both methods lead to 1/2, and the numerical example for n=1000 also supports this, I think the correct answer is 1/2. However, the user provided the answer as 2/3, which suggests there might be a mistake in either the problem statement or the provided answer. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation of the problem.

Wait, another thought: Maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n. Then, using the previous result:

If S = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ 1/2, then n*S ≈ n/2 → ∞. Not 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n². Then, n²*S ≈ n²*(1/2) = n²/2 → ∞. Also not 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) divided by n. Then, S/n ≈ (1/2)/n → 0. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem involves a different function, like arcsin(k/n³) instead of arcsin(k/n²). Let me check that quickly.

If the problem were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n³), then each term is arcsin(k/n³) ≈ k/n³. The sum would be sum_{k=1}^n k/n³ = (n(n+1)/2)/n³ = (n+1)/(2n²) → 0. But again, not 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n. Then, as before, n*S ≈ n*(1/2) → ∞.

Given all these considerations, I think the correct answer is 1/2, but there might be a mistake in the problem statement or the provided answer. However, since the user specified that the answer is 2/3, I need to reconcile this.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the integral approximation. Let me re-examine the integral calculation.

We have S ≈ n² ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Let me compute the integral ∫ arcsin(x) dx from 0 to 1/n.

The antiderivative is x arcsin(x) + √(1 - x²). Evaluated from 0 to 1/n:

At upper limit: (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - (1/n)^2)

At lower limit: 0 + √1 = 1

So the integral is [(1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - 1/n²)] - 1.

Multiply by n²:

n² [ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ] = n arcsin(1/n) + n² [ √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ]

Expand arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n + (1/n)^3 /6 + ..., so n arcsin(1/n) ≈ n*(1/n + 1/(6n³)) = 1 + 1/(6n²) → 1.

Expand √(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - (1/(2n²)) - (1/(8n⁴)) - ..., so n² [ √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ] ≈ n² [ -1/(2n²) - 1/(8n⁴) - ... ] = -1/2 - 1/(8n²) - ... → -1/2.

So total S ≈ 1 - 1/2 = 1/2. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to compute the limit of n times the sum, but that would be infinity. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Wait, maybe I need to consider that arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ..., and when summed, the sum is sum x + sum x³/6 + sum x⁵/40 + ... But the sum of x is 1/2, and the sum of x³ is negligible. Therefore, the total sum is 1/2. Therefore, the answer is 1/2.

Given that, I think there's an error in the problem's provided answer. Perhaps the original problem was different, such as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n, but even then, it would go to infinity. Alternatively, maybe the problem was to compute the limit of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n², but that would also go to infinity.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is a trick question. For example, if the sum telescopes or something. Let me check if the sum telescopes. But arcsin(k/n²) doesn't seem to telescope. Alternatively, maybe use an identity for arcsin. But I don't recall any identity that would help here.

Alternatively, maybe consider that for each k, arcsin(k/n²) = arctan(k/n² * 1/√(1 - (k/n²)^2)). But that seems more complicated.

Alternatively, use the series expansion and sum the series. But we've already done that.

Alternatively, perhaps consider that the sum is similar to the integral of arcsin(x) over x from 0 to 1/n, scaled by n², which we've computed as 1/2.

Given all these calculations, I think the correct answer is 1/2. Therefore, the problem's provided answer of 2/3 is incorrect. Perhaps there was a typo in the problem statement. For example, if the problem were to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n², then the answer would be 1/2 * n², which goes to infinity. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the sum of arcsin(k/n²) from k=1 to n², which would be different. Let me check that quickly. If k goes up to n², then x = k/n² ranges from 1/n² to 1. Then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^{n²} arcsin(k/n²). This is a different problem, and the limit would be different. For example, splitting the sum into two parts: from k=1 to n² -1 and k=n². But k=n² gives arcsin(1) = π/2. But the sum from k=1 to n² -1 of arcsin(k/n²) would be similar to an integral over x from 0 to 1, but scaled by n². However, this is speculative.

Given the information provided, I believe the correct answer is 1/2, and there might be a mistake in the problem's provided answer. However, since the user insists the answer is 2/3, I need to reconcile this. Perhaps there's a different approach I'm missing.

Wait, another idea: Maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n. Let me compute that.

If S = n * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ n*(1/2) = n/2 → ∞. Not 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n². Then, S ≈ n²*(1/2) = n²/2 → ∞.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) / n. Then, S/n ≈ (1/2)/n → 0.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) / n². Then, S/n² ≈ (1/2)/n² → 0.

Given all these possibilities, I think the original problem might have a typo. For example, if the problem were to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n, then the answer would be infinity. If it were multiplied by n², also infinity. If it were divided by n, 0. If it were divided by n², 0. So none of these give 2/3.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/(n² + n)) or some other denominator. Let me compute that quickly.

Suppose the denominator is n² + n. Then, x = k/(n² + n) ≈ k/n² for large n. So the sum would be similar to the original problem, and the answer would still approach 1/2.

Alternatively, if the problem is to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n, then the limit is infinity. But the problem states the answer is 2/3.

Given all these considerations, I think the correct answer is 1/2, and there's likely a mistake in the problem's provided answer. However, since the user has specified the answer is 2/3, perhaps I made an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let me check one last time. Suppose I consider that arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 for small x. Then sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6]. The first sum is (n(n+1)/2)/n² = (n+1)/(2n) → 1/2. The second sum is (1/6)(sum_{k=1}^n k³)/n⁶ = (1/6)(n²(n+1)^2 /4)/n⁶ = (1/24)(1 + 2/n +1/n²)/n² → 0. So total sum is 1/2. Therefore, the answer is 1/2.

Therefore, I must conclude that the correct answer is 1/2, and there's either a typo in the problem or the provided answer is incorrect. Given the calculations and multiple approaches, I cannot see how the sum would approach 2/3. Therefore, I believe the answer is 1/2.

To evaluate the limit \\(\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\), we start by approximating \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) for small arguments. For small \\(x\\), \\(\\arcsin(x) \\approx x + \\frac{x^3}{6} + \\cdots\\). Since \\(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\) is small for large \\(n\\), we can approximate \\(\\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right) \\approx \\frac{k}{n^2}\\).

The sum \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\arcsin\\left(\\frac{k}{n^2}\\right)\\) can thus be approximated by \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2}\\). The sum of the first \\(n\\) natural numbers is \\(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\), so:

\\[
\\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{k}{n^2} = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2n^2} = \\frac{n+1}{2n}
\\]

As \\(n \\to \\infty\\), \\(\\frac{n+1}{2n} \\to \\frac{1}{2}\\).

We also considered higher-order terms in the Taylor expansion of \\(\\arcsin(x)\\), but they contribute terms that vanish as \\(n \\to \\infty\\). For example, the next term \\(\\sum_{k=1}^n \\left(\\frac{k^3}{6n^6}\\right)\\) tends to 0.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the limit as n approaches infinity of the sum from k=1 to n of arcsin(k/n²). Hmm, let's start by understanding what's happening here. The function inside the sum is arcsin(k/n²), and we're summing this from k=1 to n, then taking the limit as n goes to infinity. 

First, maybe I should recall that arcsin(x) is approximately equal to x when x is near 0, because for small angles, the sine of the angle is approximately the angle itself. So if k/n² is small for large n, then arcsin(k/n²) should be approximately k/n². Let me check if that's a valid approximation here.

Since we're summing from k=1 to n, the maximum value of k/n² would be when k = n, so that's n/n² = 1/n. As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0. So all the terms in the sum are approaching 0, which means the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x should be valid because x here is small. Therefore, maybe the sum can be approximated by the sum of k/n² from k=1 to n, and then take the limit.

If that's the case, then the sum becomes (1/n²) * sum from k=1 to n of k. The sum from k=1 to n of k is a standard arithmetic series, which is n(n + 1)/2. So substituting that in, we get (1/n²)(n(n + 1)/2) = (n + 1)/(2n) = (1 + 1/n)/2. As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so the limit would be 1/2. Wait, but the problem statement mentions something about 2/3. Did I do something wrong here?

Wait, maybe my initial approximation is too simplistic. Let me think again. The approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x is good for small x, but perhaps there are higher-order terms that matter when summed over many terms. Let me consider the expansion of arcsin(x) around x=0. The Taylor series for arcsin(x) is x + (x³)/6 + (3x⁵)/40 + ... So if I use arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6, maybe the next term is significant when summed over n terms.

So let's try expanding arcsin(k/n²) as approximately k/n² + (k/n²)³ / 6. Then the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)]. The first part is the same as before, giving (1 + 1/n)/2, which tends to 1/2. The second part is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶). Let's compute that sum. The sum of k³ from k=1 to n is [n(n + 1)/2]^2. So substituting, we get [n²(n + 1)^2/4]/(6n⁶) = (n²(n + 1)^2)/(24n⁶) = (n + 1)^2/(24n⁴). As n approaches infinity, this tends to 0. So the second term doesn't contribute to the limit. Therefore, even with the next term in the expansion, the limit is still 1/2. But the problem mentions 2/3. Hmm, maybe I need to check my approach again.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum can be approximated by an integral. Since we have a sum over k from 1 to n of arcsin(k/n²), maybe we can approximate the sum by an integral. Let me consider the substitution x = k/n². Then, k ranges from 1 to n, so x ranges from 1/n² to n/n² = 1/n. But as n approaches infinity, the upper limit approaches 0. Wait, that seems confusing. Maybe another substitution.

Alternatively, let's set t = k/n. Then k = nt, and the term arcsin(k/n²) becomes arcsin(t/n). Then, the sum can be written as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(t/n) where t = k/n. So the sum is over t = 1/n, 2/n, ..., 1, with step size 1/n. Therefore, the sum is approximately the integral from t=0 to t=1 of arcsin(0) dt, but wait, arcsin(0) is 0. That doesn't seem right. Maybe this approach isn't correct.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the integral approximation for sums. The sum from k=1 to n of f(k/n²) can be approximated by n² times the integral from 0 to 1/n of f(x) dx, but I'm not sure. Wait, let's consider substituting x = k/n². Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x) where x = k/n². The step size in x is Δx = 1/n². The sum is approximately the integral from x=1/n² to x=n/n² = 1/n of arcsin(x) / Δx dx. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall that sum_{k=1}^n f(a + kΔx) Δx ≈ integral from a to a + nΔx of f(x) dx. But here, the step size in k is 1, and x = k/n², so Δx = 1/n². Therefore, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x) = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ (1/Δx) * integral from x=1/n² to x=1/n of arcsin(x) dx. But 1/Δx = n², so the sum is approximately n² * integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx (since 1/n² is approaching 0 as n approaches infinity). Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx.

But integrating arcsin(x) isn't straightforward. Let's compute the integral of arcsin(x) dx. Integration by parts: let u = arcsin(x), dv = dx. Then du = 1/√(1 - x²) dx, v = x. So the integral is x arcsin(x) - ∫ x / √(1 - x²) dx. The integral of x / √(1 - x²) dx is -√(1 - x²) + C. Therefore, the integral of arcsin(x) dx is x arcsin(x) + √(1 - x²) + C.

So evaluating from 0 to 1/n: [ (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - (1/n)^2) ] - [0 + 1] = (1/n) arcsin(1/n) + √(1 - 1/n²) - 1. As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so arcsin(1/n) ≈ 1/n, and √(1 - 1/n²) ≈ 1 - 1/(2n²). Therefore, the expression becomes (1/n)(1/n) + (1 - 1/(2n²)) - 1 ≈ 1/n² + 1 - 1/(2n²) - 1 = 1/n² - 1/(2n²) = 1/(2n²). Therefore, the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx ≈ 1/(2n²). Then, multiplying by n² gives n² * 1/(2n²) = 1/2. So again, the limit is 1/2. But this contradicts the problem's mention of 2/3. Hmm, maybe my approach is missing something.

Wait, perhaps the integral approximation is too crude here. Let me think again. The sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Each term is arcsin(k/n²). If I consider that for large n, each term is small, so arcsin(k/n²) ≈ k/n² + (k/n²)^3 / 6. Then the sum is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + sum_{k=1}^n (k/n²)^3 /6. As before, the first sum is (1 + 1/n)/2, which tends to 1/2. The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³ / (6n⁶) = [n²(n + 1)^2 / 4] / (6n⁶) = (n + 1)^2 / (24n⁴) ≈ 1/(24n²), which tends to 0. So even with the next term, the limit is 1/2. So why does the problem mention 2/3? Maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly. Wait, let me check the original problem again. It says: Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) and then it shows 2/3. Maybe the original problem had a different exponent? For example, if it were arcsin(k/n) instead of arcsin(k/n²), the limit would be different. Let me check that. If the sum is arcsin(k/n), then for each term, arcsin(k/n) ≈ k/n for large n, so the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n k/n = (n(n + 1)/2)/n = (n + 1)/2, which tends to infinity. But that's not the case here. Alternatively, maybe the exponent is different.

Wait, maybe the original problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me try a different approach. Let's consider that arcsin(x) ≤ x for x ≥ 0, which is true because the sine function is concave in [0, π/2], so its inverse, arcsin(x), is convex there. Wait, actually, the inequality arcsin(x) ≤ x is not true. For x > 0, arcsin(x) > x, because the graph of arcsin(x) lies above the line y=x for x > 0. For example, arcsin(0.5) ≈ 0.5236, which is greater than 0.5. So my initial approximation of arcsin(x) ≈ x is actually an underestimate. Therefore, maybe I need to consider a better approximation.

So if arcsin(x) ≥ x for x > 0, then the sum sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≥ sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (1 + 1/n)/2, which tends to 1/2. But the problem suggests the limit is 2/3. So perhaps there's a higher-order term that contributes. Let's see. Let's expand arcsin(x) around 0. The Taylor series is x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + O(x⁵). Therefore, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + ...]

We already saw that the first term gives 1/2. The second term is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [n²(n + 1)^2 /4] / (6n⁶) = (n + 1)^2/(24n⁴) ≈ 1/(24n²), which tends to 0. So even with the next term, the sum still tends to 1/2. Therefore, maybe my initial approximation is correct, and the answer is 1/2, but the problem says 2/3. Maybe there's a mistake here.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use a different approach. Let's consider the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Let me perform a substitution. Let x_k = k/n². Then, the sum becomes sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x_k). Now, let's consider that for large n, x_k is small, so arcsin(x_k) ≈ x_k + x_k³/6. Then, S_n ≈ sum_{k=1}^n x_k + sum_{k=1}^n x_k³/6 = sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶). The first sum is (n(n + 1)/2)/n² = (n + 1)/(2n) = 1/2 + 1/(2n). The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [n²(n + 1)^2 /4]/(6n⁶) = (n + 1)^2/(24n⁴) ≈ 1/(24n²). So as n approaches infinity, S_n ≈ 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²). Therefore, the limit is 1/2. But this contradicts the problem's stated answer. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or my approach is missing something.

Wait, maybe I need to use a different approximation. Let me think. Suppose we approximate arcsin(x) by x + x³/6, but perhaps there's another term that contributes. Wait, the Taylor series is x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, the next term is 3x⁵/40, but for x = k/n², x⁵ = k⁵/n¹⁰. Summing over k from 1 to n, sum_{k=1}^n k⁵/n¹⁰ = [n⁶/6]/n¹⁰ = 1/(6n⁴), which is negligible. So higher-order terms beyond x³ are negligible as n becomes large. Therefore, the approximation up to x³ is sufficient. Then, the sum S_n ≈ sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)] ≈ 1/2 + o(1), so the limit is 1/2.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is written with a different exponent. For example, if the exponent were 1 instead of 2, like arcsin(k/n), then the limit would be different. Let's check that. If the problem had sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), then for each term, arcsin(k/n) ≈ k/n + (k/n)^3 /6 + ..., so the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n [k/n + k³/(6n³) + ...]. The first term is sum_{k=1}^n k/n = (n(n + 1)/2)/n = (n + 1)/2, which tends to infinity. But that's not the case here. So the exponent 2 is crucial here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) and the limit is indeed 1/2, but the user mentioned 2/3. Maybe there's a miscalculation in the problem statement. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let me try another approach. Let's consider the sum S_n = sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Consider that arcsin(x) can be approximated by x for small x, but maybe there's a correction term. Let me recall that arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, using only the first two terms, we have arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6. Then, S_n ≈ sum_{k=1}^n (k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6). As before, the first sum is (1 + 1/n)/2, and the second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [n²(n + 1)^2 /4]/(6n⁶) = (n + 1)^2/(24n⁴) ≈ 1/(24n²). So, S_n ≈ 1/2 + 1/(2n) + 1/(24n²). Therefore, as n approaches infinity, S_n approaches 1/2. Therefore, the limit is 1/2. 

But the problem mentions 2/3. Maybe there is a different approach. Let's consider that perhaps the integral of arcsin(x) from 0 to something. Wait, but earlier when I tried the integral approximation, I ended up with 1/2. Alternatively, maybe using Riemann sums. If we set x = k/n², then the sum is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(x) where x = k/n². The step size in x is Δx = 1/n². But the sum is over x from 1/n² to 1/n, which is a very small interval as n approaches infinity. So the sum is approximately the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx multiplied by n². But we saw that the integral from 0 to 1/n of arcsin(x) dx ≈ 1/(2n²), so multiplied by n² gives 1/2. So again, the same result.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly, and the exponent is 3 instead of 2. Let's check. If the problem were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n³), then each term would be arcsin(k/n³) ≈ k/n³, and the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n k/n³ = (n(n + 1)/2)/n³ = (n + 1)/(2n²) ≈ 1/(2n), which tends to 0. So that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the sum is from k=1 to n² of arcsin(k/n²), but that would be different. But the problem states from k=1 to n.

Wait, let me check my initial approximation again. If arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6, then sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ sum_{k=1}^n (k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)). The first sum is (1 + 1/n)/2, which tends to 1/2. The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = (n²(n + 1)^2 /4)/(6n⁶) = (n + 1)^2/(24n⁴) ≈ 1/(24n²). So the total sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(24n²). Therefore, the limit is 1/2. 

But the problem mentions 2/3. Maybe there is a different approach. Let me consider using the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6, but perhaps integrating in a different way. Let's write the sum as sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + ...]. Then, the sum is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) + ... The first term is (n + 1)/(2n) → 1/2. The second term is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [n²(n + 1)^2 /4]/(6n⁶) = (n + 1)^2/(24n⁴) → 0 as n → ∞. So the limit is 1/2. Therefore, unless there is a miscalculation, the answer should be 1/2. 

But the problem states 2/3. Maybe I made a mistake in the problem statement? Let me check again. The user wrote: ""Evaluate the limit: lim_{n→∞} sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) 2/3"". Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly, and the correct answer is 2/3, but my calculations keep leading to 1/2. Alternatively, maybe I need to use a different approximation. 

Wait, let's try approximating arcsin(k/n²) using a different method. For small x, arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 + ... So, if we take the first two terms, the sum would be sum_{k=1}^n (k/n² + k³/(6n⁶)) = sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶). The first sum is (n(n + 1)/2)/n² = (n + 1)/(2n) → 1/2. The second sum is [n²(n + 1)^2 /4]/(6n⁶) = (n + 1)^2/(24n⁴) → 0. Therefore, the limit is 1/2. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) and the correct answer is 1/2, but the user mistakenly wrote 2/3. Alternatively, perhaps the original problem had a different exponent or different function. 

Alternatively, maybe I need to use a more precise approximation. Let's consider that arcsin(x) can be approximated by x + x³/6 + (3x⁵)/40 + ... So, including up to x⁵ term. Then, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + k³/(6n⁶) + 3k⁵/(40n^{10})]. The first sum is 1/2, the second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) ≈ 1/(24n²) → 0, and the third sum is sum_{k=1}^n 3k⁵/(40n^{10}) = 3/(40n^{10}) sum_{k=1}^n k⁵ ≈ 3/(40n^{10}) * n⁶/6 = 3/(40n⁴) → 0. So even with more terms, the limit is still 1/2. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is written incorrectly. If instead of arcsin(k/n²), it's arcsin(k/n), then the limit would be infinity, as we saw earlier. If it's arcsin(k/n^3), the limit would be 0. 

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) and the correct answer is 1/2, but the user mentioned 2/3 due to a different problem. Alternatively, maybe I need to check another method.

Let me try to use the approximation arcsin(x) = x + x³/6 + o(x³) for small x. Then, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n [k/n² + (k/n²)^3 /6 + o((k/n²)^3)].

The first sum is sum_{k=1}^n k/n² = (1 + 1/n)/2 → 1/2.

The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n (k³)/(6n⁶) = [n²(n + 1)^2 /4]/(6n⁶) = (n + 1)^2/(24n⁴) ≈ 1/(24n²) → 0.

The error term is sum_{k=1}^n o((k/n²)^3) = o(1/n³) * sum_{k=1}^n k³ = o(1/n³) * O(n⁴) = o(n) → 0.

Therefore, the total sum is 1/2 + o(1), so the limit is 1/2.

Therefore, unless there is a miscalculation, the answer should be 1/2. But the problem mentions 2/3. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps I need to consider a different approach.

Wait, another idea: maybe the original problem is sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) multiplied by n, so the limit would be n * (sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²)). Then, as n approaches infinity, we could approximate the sum as an integral. Let's check this. If the problem were lim_{n→∞} n * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), then the sum would be approximately n * [1/2 + o(1)] = n/2, which tends to infinity. But that's not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the exponent is 1 instead of 2. If it's sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n), then as we saw earlier, the sum is approximately sum_{k=1}^n [k/n + (k/n)^3 /6], which is (n + 1)/2 + sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n³). The first term is (n + 1)/2, which tends to infinity. The second term is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n³) = [n²(n + 1)^2 /4]/(6n³) = (n + 1)^2/(24n) ≈ n/(24), which also tends to infinity. So the limit would be infinity, which is different.

Alternatively, maybe the exponent is 3/2. If the problem were sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n^{3/2}), then the terms would be k/n^{3/2}, and sum_{k=1}^n k/n^{3/2} = (n(n + 1)/2)/n^{3/2} = (n + 1)/(2n^{1/2}) → infinity. Not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps the exponent is 1.5, but that complicates things. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit of the average, i.e., (1/n) sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Then, the limit would be (1/n)(1/2 + o(1)) = 1/(2n) → 0. But that's not the case here.

Alternatively, maybe I need to consider the sum as an approximation to an integral with a different scaling. Let's think again. If we have sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²), and we set x = k/n², then the step size in x is Δx = 1/n². The sum can be approximated by the integral from x = 0 to x = 1/n of arcsin(x) / Δx dx. Wait, that might be similar to the earlier approach. So sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) ≈ (1/Δx) ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. Then, 1/Δx = n², so the integral becomes n² ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx. As before, ∫_{0}^{1/n} arcsin(x) dx ≈ x arcsin(x) + √(1 - x²) from 0 to 1/n. Which is (1/n)(1/n) + √(1 - 1/n²) - 1 ≈ 1/n² + (1 - 1/(2n²)) - 1 = 1/n² - 1/(2n²) = 1/(2n²). Then, multiplying by n² gives 1/2. So again, the limit is 1/2.

Therefore, unless there's a mistake in my calculations, the answer should be 1/2. However, the problem statement mentions 2/3, which makes me think that perhaps the original problem had a different exponent. For example, if the exponent were 1 instead of 2, but even then, the sum would diverge. Alternatively, if the exponent were 3, the sum would converge to 0. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit of the sum multiplied by n. For example, lim_{n→∞} n * sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²). Then, the sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(2n), so multiplying by n gives n*(1/2 + 1/(2n)) = n/2 + 1/2, which tends to infinity. Not helpful.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is to evaluate the limit of the sum multiplied by n^{1/2}. Then, n^{1/2} * sum ≈ n^{1/2}*(1/2 + 1/(2n)) = n^{1/2}/2 + 1/(2n^{1/2}), which tends to infinity.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's consider using the approximation arcsin(x) ≈ x + x³/6 for all terms. Then, sum_{k=1}^n arcsin(k/n²) = sum_{k=1}^n k/n² + sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶). The first sum is (n + 1)/(2n) → 1/2. The second sum is sum_{k=1}^n k³/(6n⁶) = [n²(n + 1)^2 /4]/(6n⁶) = (n + 1)^2/(24n⁴) ≈ 1/(24n²). So, the total sum is approximately 1/2 + 1/(24n²). Therefore, the limit is 1/2. 

Given that all approaches lead to 1/2, I think the answer should be 1/2. The mention of 2/3 might be a mistake in the problem statement or a misdirection. Therefore, I will conclude that the limit is 1/2.

","Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that the limit as n approaches infinity of p_{n+1}/p_n is 1, where p_k is the sequence of prime numbers, I need to determine if it follows that the limit as n approaches infinity of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) is also 1. Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I know that primes get less frequent as numbers get larger, but their distribution is described by the Prime Number Theorem. The Prime Number Theorem tells us that the nth prime p_n is approximately n log n. So, p_n ~ n log n as n becomes large. Maybe this approximation can help me here.

Given that, if p_n is roughly n log n, then p_{n+1} would be roughly (n+1) log(n+1). So, let's write out the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n using this approximation. That would be [(n+1) log(n+1)] / [n log n]. Let me simplify that. 

Expanding the numerator, (n+1) log(n+1) is n log(n+1) + log(n+1). The denominator is n log n. So, the ratio becomes [n log(n+1) + log(n+1)] / [n log n]. Dividing both terms in the numerator by n log n gives log(n+1)/log n + log(n+1)/(n log n). 

Now, as n approaches infinity, log(n+1)/log n tends to 1 because log(n+1) and log n are very close when n is large. The second term, log(n+1)/(n log n), tends to 0 because the log terms are much smaller than n. Therefore, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1 + 0 = 1, which matches the given condition. So, the approximation seems consistent with the given limit.

Now, the question is about log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n). Let's use the same approximation. If p_n ~ n log n, then log(p_n) ~ log(n log n) = log n + log log n. Similarly, log(p_{n+1}) ~ log((n+1) log(n+1)) = log(n+1) + log log(n+1). 

So, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) would be [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. Let's simplify this. For large n, log(n+1) is approximately log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n. Similarly, log log(n+1) is log(log n + log(1 + 1/n)) ≈ log log n + log(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ log log n + 1/(n log n). 

Therefore, substituting back into the ratio, we get [log n + 1/n + log log n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n]. Dividing numerator and denominator by log n, we have [1 + (1/n)/log n + (log log n)/log n + (1/(n log n))/log n] / [1 + (log log n)/log n]. 

As n approaches infinity, (1/n)/log n and (1/(n log n))/log n both go to 0. Similarly, (log log n)/log n also goes to 0 because log log n grows much slower than log n. So, the entire expression simplifies to [1 + 0 + 0 + 0]/[1 + 0] = 1. Therefore, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) tends to 1 as n approaches infinity.

Wait, but let me check if this reasoning is solid. The key step here was approximating log(p_n) as log n + log log n. Is that accurate? Let me verify. The Prime Number Theorem says that p_n is approximately n log n, so log(p_n) is log(n log n) = log n + log log n. Yes, that's correct. So, the approximation holds.

Then, when we take log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n), substituting the approximations, we get the ratio [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. As n becomes large, log(n+1) is approximately log n + 1/n, and log log(n+1) is approximately log log n + 1/(n log n). So, plugging these into the ratio, the leading terms are log n and log log n, which are the same in the numerator and denominator. The lower-order terms become negligible, leading the ratio to approach 1.

Therefore, based on the Prime Number Theorem and the approximations, it does follow that the limit of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) as n approaches infinity is 1.

But wait, let me think again. The problem states that lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1. Does this necessarily imply that lim_{n→∞} log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1? Or is the Prime Number Theorem assumption necessary here?

The problem gives us that the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1. So, we can't directly assume the Prime Number Theorem; we have to see if the given condition alone is sufficient. Maybe the Prime Number Theorem is a consequence of the given condition? Or perhaps the given condition is weaker?

Wait, actually, the Prime Number Theorem tells us that p_n ~ n log n, which implies that p_{n+1}/p_n ~ (n+1 log(n+1))/(n log n) ~ (1 + 1/n) * (log(n+1)/log n). As n tends to infinity, log(n+1)/log n tends to 1, so the ratio tends to (1 + 0)*1 = 1. So, the given condition is actually implied by the Prime Number Theorem. Therefore, if we have that p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, that's consistent with the Prime Number Theorem.

But the question is whether the given condition (the ratio of consecutive primes tending to 1) implies that the ratio of their logarithms also tends to 1. So, perhaps even without assuming the Prime Number Theorem, can we derive that log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) tends to 1 from the given condition?

Let me try to approach this without relying on the Prime Number Theorem. Suppose that lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1. Let's denote this ratio as r_n = p_{n+1}/p_n, so lim_{n→∞} r_n = 1.

We need to find lim_{n→∞} log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = lim_{n→∞} log(p_n * r_n)/log(p_n) = lim_{n→∞} [log p_n + log r_n]/log p_n = lim_{n→∞} [1 + log r_n / log p_n] = 1 + lim_{n→∞} log r_n / log p_n.

Therefore, the problem reduces to whether lim_{n→∞} log r_n / log p_n = 0.

Given that r_n → 1, log r_n ≈ r_n - 1 for large n (since log(1 + x) ≈ x when x is small). So, log r_n ≈ r_n - 1. Therefore, log r_n / log p_n ≈ (r_n - 1)/log p_n.

So, if we can show that (r_n - 1)/log p_n → 0, then the limit would be 1.

Given that r_n → 1, r_n = 1 + ε_n where ε_n → 0. Then, log r_n = log(1 + ε_n) ≈ ε_n - ε_n^2/2 + ... ≈ ε_n. Therefore, log r_n ≈ ε_n.

Thus, (r_n - 1)/log p_n ≈ ε_n / log p_n. So, if ε_n = o(log p_n), then ε_n / log p_n → 0.

But do we know how fast ε_n tends to zero? The given condition is only that ε_n → 0. So, ε_n could be, for example, 1/n, which would make ε_n / log p_n ≈ (1/n)/(log n + log log n) → 0. Alternatively, if ε_n is something like 1/(n log n), then the ratio would still go to 0. However, if ε_n is of the order 1/log p_n, then the ratio would be constant. But the given condition is just ε_n → 0, which is a much weaker condition. Therefore, in general, even if ε_n tends to zero, unless we have more information on the rate, we can't be sure that ε_n / log p_n tends to zero.

Wait, but in reality, the rate at which p_{n+1}/p_n approaches 1 is related to the distribution of primes. From the Prime Number Theorem, we know that the nth prime is ~ n log n, so p_{n+1}/p_n ~ (n+1 log(n+1))/(n log n) ~ (1 + 1/n) * (log n + log(1 + 1/n))/log n ≈ (1 + 1/n) * (1 + (1/n)/log n) ≈ 1 + 1/n + 1/(n log n). Therefore, in this case, ε_n = p_{n+1}/p_n - 1 ≈ 1/n + 1/(n log n). Therefore, ε_n ~ 1/n. Then, log p_n ~ log n + log log n. Therefore, ε_n / log p_n ~ (1/n)/(log n + log log n) → 0. Therefore, in this case, the ratio tends to zero, so the limit is 1.

But the problem states that lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1, which is true even with the Prime Number Theorem. However, if someone were to suppose that p_{n+1}/p_n approaches 1 but maybe slower, would the same conclusion hold?

Wait, but the problem is not assuming the Prime Number Theorem; it's just given that the ratio of consecutive primes tends to 1. So, in general, if we have that lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1, does that imply lim_{n→∞} log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1?

From the earlier analysis, we need to check whether (r_n - 1)/log p_n → 0. If r_n = 1 + ε_n with ε_n → 0, then (r_n - 1)/log p_n = ε_n / log p_n. Therefore, unless ε_n = o(log p_n), the limit might not be zero. But given that ε_n → 0, regardless of how fast, but log p_n tends to infinity (since primes go to infinity), then as long as ε_n is o(log p_n), the ratio tends to zero. But is ε_n necessarily o(log p_n)?

Wait, even if ε_n tends to zero, but log p_n tends to infinity, the ratio ε_n / log p_n could still be zero if ε_n is any function that tends to zero, regardless of the rate. For example, even if ε_n = 1/(log p_n)^2, then ε_n / log p_n = 1/(log p_n)^3, which still tends to zero. Alternatively, if ε_n = 1/(log p_n)^{1/2}, the ratio is 1/(log p_n)^{3/2} → 0. So, regardless of how ε_n decays, as long as it's tending to zero, the ratio ε_n / log p_n tends to zero. Therefore, in general, lim_{n→∞} log r_n / log p_n = lim_{n→∞} ε_n / log p_n = 0. Therefore, lim_{n→∞} log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1 + 0 = 1.

Wait, that seems to be the case. Let me verify this again. If we have that r_n = p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, then log r_n = log(1 + ε_n) ≈ ε_n for small ε_n. Therefore, log r_n ≈ ε_n. Then, log r_n / log p_n ≈ ε_n / log p_n. Since ε_n → 0 and log p_n → ∞, the ratio ε_n / log p_n → 0. Therefore, the limit is 1 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the limit is 1. But wait, let me test this with an example. Suppose that p_n is such that p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + 1/n. Then, log(p_{n+1}/p_n) = log(1 + 1/n) ≈ 1/n - 1/(2n^2) + ... So, log(r_n) ≈ 1/n. Then, log r_n / log p_n ≈ (1/n)/log p_n. If log p_n ~ log n (which would be the case if p_n ~ n), then (1/n)/log n → 0. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1. Alternatively, if p_n grows faster than n, say p_n ~ n^2, then log p_n ~ 2 log n. Then, even if r_n = 1 + 1/n, log r_n ~ 1/n, so (1/n)/(2 log n) → 0. Therefore, in all cases, as long as r_n tends to 1, regardless of how p_n grows, the ratio log r_n / log p_n tends to zero, hence the overall limit is 1.

Therefore, even without invoking the Prime Number Theorem, given that p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, it follows that log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) tends to 1. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But wait, let me check another angle. Suppose that p_n is a sequence where p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, but p_n is not necessarily of the form n log n. For instance, suppose p_n = n. Then, p_{n+1}/p_n = (n+1)/n → 1. Then, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = log(n+1)/log n → 1. So, even in this case, the ratio of logarithms tends to 1. If p_n grows polynomially, say p_n = n^k, then p_{n+1}/p_n = (n+1)^k / n^k ≈ (1 + 1/n)^k → 1. Then, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = [k log(n+1)] / [k log n] = log(n+1)/log n → 1. So, regardless of the exponent, the ratio tends to 1.

Alternatively, if p_n grows exponentially, say p_n = e^n, then p_{n+1}/p_n = e^{n+1}/e^n = e → e, which does not tend to 1. So, such a sequence does not satisfy the given condition. Therefore, the given condition that p_{n+1}/p_n → 1 implies that p_n cannot grow exponentially, but must grow slower than exponential. However, even if p_n grows slower than exponential, as long as p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, then log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) should still tend to 1.

Wait, but let's take a concrete example where p_{n+1}/p_n → 1 but p_n is not of the form n log n. For example, let p_n = n. Then, p_{n+1}/p_n = (n+1)/n → 1, and log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = log(n+1)/log n → 1. Another example: let p_n = n log n. Then, p_{n+1}/p_n ≈ (n+1 log(n+1))/(n log n) ≈ (1 + 1/n)(log(n+1)/log n) → 1, and log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) ≈ [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)]/[log n + log log n] → 1. If p_n = n^2, then p_{n+1}/p_n = ((n+1)^2)/n^2 ≈ (1 + 2/n + 1/n^2) → 1, and log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = [2 log(n+1)]/[2 log n] = log(n+1)/log n → 1. So, in all these cases, even with different growth rates, as long as the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, the ratio of the logarithms also tends to 1.

Therefore, it seems that the given condition is sufficient to conclude that the ratio of the logarithms tends to 1. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But let me check another angle. Suppose that p_n is a sequence where p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + 1/n^2. Then, log(p_{n+1}/p_n) = log(1 + 1/n^2) ≈ 1/n^2 - 1/(2n^4) + ... So, log(p_{n+1}/p_n) ≈ 1/n^2. Then, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = [log p_n + log(1 + 1/n^2)] / log p_n = 1 + [1/n^2]/log p_n. If p_n grows like n, then log p_n ~ log n, so [1/n^2]/log n → 0. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1. If p_n grows faster, say p_n = n log n, then log p_n ~ log n + log log n, so still [1/n^2]/(log n + log log n) → 0. Therefore, regardless of the growth rate of p_n, as long as p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) tends to 1.

Therefore, even if the ratio of consecutive primes tends to 1 at a certain rate, the ratio of their logarithms still tends to 1. Therefore, the conclusion holds.

Thus, after considering multiple approaches and examples, it seems that the answer is yes, the limit is 1.

","Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem says that if the limit of the ratio of consecutive primes p_{n+1}/p_n is 1 as n approaches infinity, does that mean the limit of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) is also 1? Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, I know that primes get less frequent as numbers get larger, but I also remember that the Prime Number Theorem tells us that the nth prime is approximately n log n. So, p_n ~ n log n for large n. That might be useful here. Let me write that down: p_n ≈ n log n.

Given that, let's look at the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n. If p_n ≈ n log n, then p_{n+1} ≈ (n+1) log(n+1). So, the ratio would be approximately (n+1) log(n+1) / (n log n). Let's simplify that. The (n+1)/n part is 1 + 1/n, which approaches 1 as n goes to infinity. Then the log(n+1)/log n part. Since log(n+1) = log(n(1 + 1/n)) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n for large n. So, log(n+1)/log n ≈ (log n + 1/n)/log n = 1 + 1/(n log n). Therefore, putting it all together, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n ≈ (1 + 1/n)(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ 1 + 1/n + 1/(n log n) + something negligible. So, the leading term is 1 + 1/n, and the next term is 1/(n log n). Therefore, the ratio tends to 1 as n goes to infinity, which matches the given condition.

But the problem states that lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1, and we need to check if lim_{n→∞} log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1. So, even though we know the ratio of the primes tends to 1, does the ratio of their logarithms also tend to 1?

Let me think about the logarithm of the ratio. If log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = log(p_{n+1}/p_n) + log(p_n)/log(p_n) no, wait, that's not right. Wait, actually, log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n * (p_{n+1}/p_n)) = log p_n + log(p_{n+1}/p_n). Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = [log p_n + log(p_{n+1}/p_n)] / log p_n = 1 + [log(p_{n+1}/p_n)] / log p_n.

Since we know that p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, so log(p_{n+1}/p_n) → 0. Therefore, the second term is [something approaching 0] divided by log p_n. Since log p_n grows to infinity (because p_n is increasing), the entire term [log(p_{n+1}/p_n)] / log p_n should approach 0. Therefore, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) approaches 1 + 0 = 1. So, in that case, the answer would be yes.

Wait, but this seems too straightforward. Let me check my reasoning again. Starting from log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n) + log(p_{n+1}/p_n). Then dividing both sides by log(p_n) gives log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1 + [log(p_{n+1}/p_n)] / log(p_n). Since p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, log(p_{n+1}/p_n) ≈ (p_{n+1}/p_n - 1) for small differences, using the approximation log(1 + ε) ≈ ε when ε is small. So, log(p_{n+1}/p_n) ≈ (p_{n+1}/p_n - 1). Therefore, [log(p_{n+1}/p_n)] / log(p_n) ≈ (p_{n+1}/p_n - 1)/log(p_n). Since p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, the numerator approaches 0, and the denominator log(p_n) approaches infinity. Hence, the whole term approaches 0. Therefore, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) approaches 1. So, yes, the conclusion is 1.

But wait, is there a case where even if p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, the ratio of their logarithms might not approach 1? Let's think of an example. Suppose we have a sequence a_n where a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, but log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) does not approach 1. For example, take a_n = n^2. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = (n+1)^2 / n^2 = (1 + 1/n)^2 → 1. But log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = 2 log(n+1)/2 log n = log(n+1)/log n → 1. Hmm, that still approaches 1. Maybe another example. Let's take a_n = n^c for some constant c. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = (n+1)^c / n^c = (1 + 1/n)^c → 1. Then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = c log(n+1)/c log n = log(n+1)/log n → 1. So, still 1.

Alternatively, take a_n such that a_{n+1} = a_n + 1. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 + 1/a_n. If a_n grows to infinity, then this ratio tends to 1. But log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = log(a_n + 1)/log(a_n). If a_n is large, log(a_n + 1) ≈ log(a_n) + 1/a_n. So, log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) ≈ 1 + 1/(a_n log a_n) → 1. So again, it approaches 1.

Another example: suppose a_n is increasing to infinity and a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, but the difference a_{n+1} - a_n is of order 1/(log a_n). Then, log(a_{n+1}) - log(a_n) ≈ (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n = 1/(a_n log a_n). Therefore, log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) ≈ 1 + 1/(a_n log a_n log a_n) ??? Wait, maybe not. Wait, if log(a_{n+1}) = log(a_n) + log(1 + (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n) ≈ log(a_n) + (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n. Therefore, log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = 1 + (a_{n+1} - a_n)/(a_n log a_n). If a_{n+1} - a_n is of order 1, then (a_{n+1} - a_n)/(a_n log a_n) ≈ 1/(a_n log a_n) → 0. If the difference is of order, say, 1/(log a_n), then (a_{n+1} - a_n)/(a_n log a_n) ≈ 1/(a_n (log a_n)^2) → 0. Either way, the ratio approaches 1.

So, perhaps in general, whenever a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) → 1, provided that a_n → ∞. Is this a theorem? Maybe. Let me think. If a_n is a sequence such that lim_{n→∞} a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 and a_n → ∞, then lim_{n→∞} log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = 1. Is that true?

Suppose that a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 + ε_n, where ε_n → 0. Then, log(a_{n+1}) = log(a_n (1 + ε_n)) = log a_n + log(1 + ε_n) ≈ log a_n + ε_n - ε_n^2/2 + ... So, log(a_{n+1})/log a_n ≈ 1 + ε_n / log a_n. Since ε_n → 0 and log a_n → ∞, then ε_n / log a_n → 0. Therefore, the ratio approaches 1. Therefore, yes, regardless of how ε_n behaves, as long as ε_n → 0 and a_n → ∞, the ratio of the logarithms approaches 1. Therefore, in our problem, since p_n → ∞ and p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, then log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) → 1. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, let me just check with the Prime Number Theorem. Since p_n ≈ n log n, let's compute log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n). If p_n ≈ n log n, then p_{n+1} ≈ (n+1) log(n+1). So, log(p_n) ≈ log(n log n) = log n + log log n. Similarly, log(p_{n+1}) ≈ log(n+1) + log log(n+1). Let's compute the ratio:

[log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]

Divide numerator and denominator by log n:

[ (log(n+1)/log n) + (log log(n+1)/log n) ] / [1 + (log log n)/log n ]

As n → ∞, log(n+1)/log n = log(n(1 + 1/n))/log n = 1 + (log(1 + 1/n))/log n ≈ 1 + (1/n)/log n. Similarly, log log(n+1)/log n ≈ [log(log n + log(1 + 1/n))]/log n ≈ [log log n + log(1 + 1/n)]/log n ≈ (log log n)/log n + (1/n)/log n. The denominator term (log log n)/log n also tends to 0 as n → ∞. Therefore, the entire ratio becomes approximately:

[1 + (1/n)/log n + (log log n)/log n + (1/n)/log n] / [1 + (log log n)/log n] ≈ [1 + (2/n + log log n)/log n] / [1 + (log log n)/log n]

For large n, the dominant terms are in the numerator and denominator. So, numerator ≈ 1 + (log log n)/log n, denominator ≈ 1 + (log log n)/log n, so the ratio is approximately 1. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) → 1.

Therefore, both reasoning through the general sequence and applying the Prime Number Theorem lead to the conclusion that the ratio of the logarithms tends to 1. Hence, the answer is yes.

","Okay, so I need to figure out if the limit of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) as n approaches infinity equals 1, given that the limit of p_{n+1}/p_n as n approaches infinity is 1. Hmm, primes... logarithms... Let me start by recalling some basic facts about prime numbers and logarithms.

First, I remember that the Prime Number Theorem (PNT) tells us that the nth prime number p_n is approximately n log n for large n. So, p_n ~ n log n. Does this approximation help here? Maybe. If p_n is roughly n log n, then p_{n+1} would be roughly (n+1) log(n+1). Let me write that down:

p_n ~ n log n
p_{n+1} ~ (n + 1) log(n + 1)

So, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n would be approximately [(n + 1)/(n)] * [log(n + 1)/log n]. Let's compute that:

[(n + 1)/n] = 1 + 1/n
[log(n + 1)/log n] = log(n + 1)/log n

So, the entire ratio is approximately (1 + 1/n) * [log(n + 1)/log n]. Taking the limit as n approaches infinity, 1/n goes to 0, so the first part becomes 1. For the second part, log(n + 1)/log n, as n becomes large, log(n + 1) is approximately log n + log(1 + 1/n) ~ log n + 1/n. So, log(n + 1)/log n ~ (log n + 1/n)/log n = 1 + 1/(n log n). Therefore, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n ~ (1 + 1/n)(1 + 1/(n log n)) ~ 1 + 1/n + 1/(n log n). So, as n approaches infinity, this ratio tends to 1. That's consistent with the given condition that lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1.

But the question is about the ratio of their logarithms. So, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n). Let's try to express log(p_{n+1}) and log(p_n) using the approximation from the PNT.

Given p_n ~ n log n, then log p_n ~ log(n log n) = log n + log log n. Similarly, log p_{n+1} ~ log((n + 1) log(n + 1)) = log(n + 1) + log log(n + 1). Therefore, the ratio log p_{n+1}/log p_n would be approximately [log(n + 1) + log log(n + 1)] / [log n + log log n].

Let me split this into two parts:

First, log(n + 1)/log n, which we already saw is approximately 1 + 1/(n log n) as n becomes large.

Second, log log(n + 1)/log log n. Let's see, log log(n + 1) = log(log n + log(1 + 1/n)) ~ log log n + log(1 + 1/(n log n)) ~ log log n + 1/(n log n). Therefore, log log(n + 1)/log log n ~ 1 + 1/(n (log n)^2).

So, combining these, the entire ratio [log(n + 1) + log log(n + 1)] / [log n + log log n] is approximately [1 + 1/(n log n) + 1 + 1/(n (log n)^2)] / [1 + 1/(n log n)].

Wait, no. Let me correct that. The numerator is log(n + 1) + log log(n + 1) ~ [log n + 1/n] + [log log n + 1/(n log n)].

Similarly, the denominator is log n + log log n.

So, the numerator is (log n + log log n) + (1/n + 1/(n log n)), and the denominator is (log n + log log n). Therefore, the ratio is 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / (log n + log log n).

As n approaches infinity, the terms 1/n and 1/(n log n) are both going to zero, and the denominator log n + log log n is going to infinity. Therefore, the entire fraction [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / (log n + log log n) also goes to zero. Therefore, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) approaches 1 + 0 = 1.

So, that suggests that the limit is indeed 1. But wait, is this rigorous? The Prime Number Theorem gives us that p_n ~ n log n, but maybe we need to consider the error terms? The approximation p_n ~ n log n is asymptotic, but the exact behavior might have some fluctuations. However, since we're taking the limit as n approaches infinity, the leading terms should dominate, and the lower-order terms should become negligible.

Alternatively, maybe we can approach this without relying on the Prime Number Theorem. Let's think about the given condition: lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1. So, the primes are growing in such a way that consecutive primes become closer and closer in proportion. For example, if p_{n+1} = p_n + o(p_n), then p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + o(1), which tends to 1. But primes are known to satisfy this condition, as per the PNT. In fact, the PNT tells us that the gap between consecutive primes is approximately log p_n, so p_{n+1} - p_n ~ log p_n, which is much smaller than p_n. Therefore, p_{n+1}/p_n ~ 1 + (log p_n)/p_n, which tends to 1 since (log p_n)/p_n tends to 0 as n tends to infinity.

Given that p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, we can consider taking logarithms. Let's write:

log(p_{n+1}/p_n) = log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) = log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n).

If p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + ε_n, where ε_n → 0 as n → ∞, then log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n) + log(1 + ε_n) ≈ log(p_n) + ε_n - ε_n^2/2 + ...

Therefore, log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) ≈ ε_n. But since ε_n = p_{n+1}/p_n - 1, we have:

log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) ≈ (p_{n+1}/p_n - 1).

But we know that (p_{n+1}/p_n - 1) tends to 0. However, the question is about the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n). Let me denote L_n = log(p_n). Then the ratio is (L_{n+1} + (L_{n+1} - L_n))/L_n = 1 + (L_{n+1} - L_n)/L_n.

We need to evaluate lim_{n→∞} 1 + (L_{n+1} - L_n)/L_n = 1 + lim_{n→∞} (L_{n+1} - L_n)/L_n.

But we already saw that L_{n+1} - L_n = log(p_{n+1}/p_n) ≈ (p_{n+1}/p_n - 1) by the approximation log(1 + ε) ≈ ε. Since (p_{n+1}/p_n - 1) → 0, then (L_{n+1} - L_n)/L_n ≈ (p_{n+1}/p_n - 1)/L_n.

But L_n = log(p_n) ~ log(n log n) ~ log n + log log n. As n approaches infinity, log n is the dominant term, so L_n ~ log n. Therefore, (p_{n+1}/p_n - 1)/L_n ~ (o(1))/log n → 0.

Therefore, the ratio (L_{n+1} - L_n)/L_n → 0, so the entire expression tends to 1 + 0 = 1. Hence, lim_{n→∞} log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1.

Wait, but is this correct? Let me check with some specific examples. For example, take p_n = n log n (a rough approximation). Then log p_n = log n + log log n. Then log p_{n+1} = log(n+1) + log log(n+1). The ratio would be [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)]/[log n + log log n]. As n increases, log(n+1) ≈ log n + 1/n, and log log(n+1) ≈ log log n + (1/n log n). So, the difference in the logs is approximately (log n + 1/n + log log n + 1/(n log n)) - (log n + log log n) = 1/n + 1/(n log n). Therefore, the ratio is [log n + log log n + 1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n] = 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / (log n + log log n). As n approaches infinity, the numerator is O(1/n) and the denominator is O(log n), so the entire fraction is O(1/(n log n)) → 0. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1 + 0 = 1. So, this seems to hold.

But maybe there's a different approach. Let's suppose that lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1. Let's denote r_n = p_{n+1}/p_n - 1, so r_n → 0 as n → ∞. Then, log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n (1 + r_n)) = log p_n + log(1 + r_n) ≈ log p_n + r_n - r_n^2/2 + ... So, log(p_{n+1}) ≈ log p_n + r_n. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log p_n ≈ 1 + r_n / log p_n. Since r_n → 0 and log p_n → ∞, then r_n / log p_n → 0. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1.

But wait, this seems too straightforward. Let me verify with the given approximation from the PNT. Since p_n ~ n log n, log p_n ~ log n + log log n. And r_n = p_{n+1}/p_n - 1 ~ (n+1) log(n+1)/(n log n) - 1. Let's compute that:

(n+1) log(n+1)/(n log n) - 1 = [ (n+1)/n ] * [ log(n+1)/log n ] - 1 = (1 + 1/n) * (log(n+1)/log n) - 1.

Expanding log(n+1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ~ log n + 1/n - 1/(2n^2) + ..., so log(n+1)/log n ~ 1 + 1/(n log n) - 1/(2n^2 log n) + ... Therefore, multiplying by (1 + 1/n):

(1 + 1/n)(1 + 1/(n log n)) ~ 1 + 1/n + 1/(n log n) + 1/(n^2 log n).

Subtracting 1 gives r_n ~ 1/n + 1/(n log n) + 1/(n^2 log n). So, r_n ~ 1/n. Then, r_n / log p_n ~ (1/n) / (log n + log log n) ~ (1/n) / log n = 1/(n log n) → 0 as n → ∞. Therefore, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log p_n ~ 1 + 1/(n log n) → 1. So, again, this suggests the limit is 1.

But let's think about another angle. Suppose that p_{n+1}/p_n → 1. Does that necessarily mean that log p_{n+1}/log p_n → 1? Let's suppose that p_{n+1} = p_n + o(p_n). Then, log p_{n+1} = log p_n + log(1 + o(1)) ~ log p_n + o(1). Therefore, log p_{n+1}/log p_n ~ 1 + o(1)/log p_n. But since o(1) is going to 0, but log p_n is going to infinity, the ratio would still approach 1. However, this is under the assumption that p_{n+1} = p_n + o(p_n), which is indeed the case for primes (as per PNT, the gap is log p_n). So, even though the gap is significant compared to the primes themselves, it's still much smaller than the primes, so when taking the logarithm and dividing, the ratio should approach 1.

Wait, but let's suppose a different scenario where p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, but log p_{n+1}/log p_n does not. Is that possible? For example, if p_n grows very slowly, such that p_{n+1} = p_n + 1, then p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, but log p_{n+1}/log p_n would be log(p_n + 1)/log p_n ≈ (log p_n + 1/p_n)/log p_n = 1 + 1/(p_n log p_n) → 0. Wait, that's not possible because in this case, the log ratio would go to 1 from above, not to 0. Wait, no. Let's compute:

If p_{n+1} = p_n + 1, then log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n + 1) = log p_n + log(1 + 1/p_n) ≈ log p_n + 1/p_n. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log p_n ≈ 1 + 1/(p_n log p_n). As p_n increases, this tends to 1. So, even in this case, the ratio tends to 1. Hmm.

Another example: suppose p_n = n. Then p_{n+1}/p_n = (n + 1)/n → 1. Then log p_{n+1}/log p_n = log(n + 1)/log n → 1. So, again, the ratio tends to 1. So, in all these examples, even if the primes were just linear (which they are not, but just for illustration), the ratio of logarithms still tends to 1. So, it seems that if p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, then log p_{n+1}/log p_n → 1.

But wait, let's check another case where p_n grows exponentially. Suppose p_n = 2^n. Then p_{n+1}/p_n = 2, which does not tend to 1. So, this example doesn't satisfy the given condition. So, to satisfy the given condition, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n must tend to 1, which requires that p_n grows in such a way that consecutive terms are close in proportion. So, for example, if p_n = n, p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, and log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) → 1. If p_n = n log n, similarly, the ratio of logarithms tends to 1. If p_n = n^k for some k, then p_{n+1}/p_n = ((n + 1)/n)^k → 1, and log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = log((n + 1)^k)/log(n^k) = k log(n + 1)/k log n → 1. So, again, the ratio tends to 1.

Therefore, it seems that whenever p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, regardless of how p_n grows (as long as it's a positive sequence), the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) also tends to 1. Is this a general result?

Let me try to formalize this. Suppose that lim_{n→∞} a_{n+1}/a_n = 1. Then, does lim_{n→∞} log a_{n+1}/log a_n = 1?

Yes, because if a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, then log a_{n+1} = log(a_n) + log(1 + (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n). Let’s denote ε_n = (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n → 0. Then, log a_{n+1} = log a_n + ε_n - ε_n^2/2 + ... So, log a_{n+1} ≈ log a_n + ε_n. Therefore, log a_{n+1}/log a_n ≈ (log a_n + ε_n)/log a_n = 1 + ε_n / log a_n. But since ε_n → 0 and log a_n → ∞ (assuming a_n is increasing and tends to infinity, which it is for primes), then ε_n / log a_n → 0. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1.

Therefore, in general, if a sequence a_n is such that a_{n+1}/a_n → 1 and a_n → ∞, then log a_{n+1}/log a_n → 1. Since primes are increasing and go to infinity, and given that lim p_{n+1}/p_n = 1, then log p_{n+1}/log p_n must tend to 1. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But wait, let me check with the actual primes. Let's take some large primes and compute the ratio. For example, take p_n = 10^k, but primes near that. Wait, but primes near 10^k are roughly spaced by log 10^k = k log 10. So, p_{n+1} ≈ p_n + k log 10. Therefore, p_{n+1}/p_n ≈ (p_n + k log 10)/p_n = 1 + (k log 10)/p_n. Since p_n ≈ 10^k, so (k log 10)/p_n ≈ (k log 10)/10^k → 0 as k increases. Therefore, log p_{n+1}/log p_n ≈ (log(p_n + k log 10))/log p_n ≈ (log p_n + log(1 + (k log 10)/p_n))/log p_n ≈ 1 + (k log 10)/p_n log p_n. Since (k log 10)/p_n log p_n ≈ (k log 10)/10^k * k log 10 = (k^2 (log 10)^2)/10^k → 0 as k → ∞. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1. So, even in this case, the ratio of logs tends to 1.

Therefore, all these examples and general arguments suggest that if lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1, then lim_{n→∞} log p_{n+1}/log p_n = 1.

But just to be thorough, let's consider whether there's a case where p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, but log p_{n+1}/log p_n does not. Suppose we have a sequence where p_n grows such that p_{n+1} = p_n + o(p_n), but log p_{n+1}/log p_n doesn't tend to 1. Is this possible?

Suppose p_n is a sequence where p_n = e^{sqrt(n)}. Then p_{n+1}/p_n = e^{sqrt(n + 1) - sqrt(n)} ≈ e^{1/(2 sqrt(n))} ≈ 1 + 1/(2 sqrt(n)) → 1. But log p_{n+1}/log p_n = sqrt(n + 1)/sqrt(n) ≈ sqrt(1 + 1/n) ≈ 1 + 1/(2n) → 1. So, even in this case, the ratio tends to 1. Another example: p_n = 2^{n}. Then p_{n+1}/p_n = 2, which does not tend to 1, so this example doesn't satisfy the given condition. What about p_n = n! ? Then p_{n+1}/p_n = (n + 1)! /n! = n + 1 → ∞, so again, not satisfying the condition. How about p_n = e^{n}? Then p_{n+1}/p_n = e^{n + 1}/e^{n} = e → e, which does not tend to 1. So, not satisfying the condition.

Alternatively, consider a sequence where p_n grows slower, say p_n = log n. Then p_{n+1}/p_n = log(n + 1)/log n → 1. But log p_{n+1}/log p_n = log log(n + 1)/log log n. Let's compute this:

log log(n + 1)/log log n = [log(log n + log(1 + 1/n))] / log log n ≈ [log log n + log(1 + 1/n)] / log log n ≈ 1 + [log(1 + 1/n)] / log log n ≈ 1 + (1/n) / log log n → 1 as n → ∞. So, even here, the ratio tends to 1.

Therefore, it seems that as long as p_{n+1}/p_n → 1 and p_n → ∞, then log p_{n+1}/log p_n → 1. Since primes satisfy p_{n+1}/p_n → 1 and p_n → ∞, the conclusion is that the ratio of their logarithms also tends to 1.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the limit is 1.

","Okay, let's try to figure out if the limit of the ratio of the natural logarithms of consecutive primes approaches 1, given that the ratio of the primes themselves approaches 1 as n goes to infinity. Hmm. So, we have two things here: first, the ratio of consecutive primes tends to 1, and we need to see if the ratio of their logarithms also tends to 1. 

Wait, I know that primes get less frequent as numbers get larger, but the primes themselves are getting larger too. The Prime Number Theorem tells us that the nth prime is approximately n log n, right? So, p_n ≈ n log n. Then, p_{n+1} would be approximately (n+1) log(n+1). So, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n would be roughly [(n+1) log(n+1)] / [n log n]. Let me see. If n is large, n+1 is approximately n, so that ratio becomes (1 + 1/n) * [log(n+1)/log n]. Then, as n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, and log(n+1)/log n approaches 1 because log(n+1) is log n plus log(1 + 1/n), which is approximately 1/n for large n. So, the whole ratio would be approximately (1 + 1/n)(1 + 1/(n log n)), which tends to 1 as n goes to infinity. That seems to align with the given condition that the limit of p_{n+1}/p_n is 1.

But now, the question is about the ratio of their logarithms. So, log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n). If p_n is approximately n log n, then log(p_n) is log(n log n) = log n + log log n. Similarly, log(p_{n+1}) is log((n+1) log(n+1)) = log(n+1) + log log(n+1). So, the ratio would be [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. Let's see. As n becomes large, log(n+1) is log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n. And log log(n+1) is log(log n + log(1 + 1/n)) ≈ log log n + log(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ log log n + 1/(n log n). So, putting that into the numerator: log(n+1) + log log(n+1) ≈ log n + 1/n + log log n + 1/(n log n). The denominator is log n + log log n. So, the ratio becomes [log n + log log n + 1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n]. Dividing numerator and denominator by log n + log log n, we get 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n]. As n tends to infinity, the numerator of the fraction is 1/n + 1/(n log n), which is o(1), and the denominator is log n + log log n, which goes to infinity. Therefore, the entire fraction tends to 0, so the ratio tends to 1 + 0 = 1. Therefore, the limit of log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n) should be 1.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Suppose we take the logarithm of the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n, which would be log(p_{n+1}/p_n) = log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n). Given that the limit of p_{n+1}/p_n is 1, then log(p_{n+1}/p_n) tends to log(1) = 0. So, log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) tends to 0. But we need to see whether log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n) tends to 1. Let's write log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n) + [log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n)]. Then, log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n) = 1 + [log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n)] / log(p_n). As n tends to infinity, if [log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n)] tends to 0, then the second term is o(1)/log(p_n), which would be o(1)/log n, since log(p_n) is approximately log n + log log n. So, that term would go to 0 as n tends to infinity. Therefore, the ratio log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n) would approach 1. 

But wait, does log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) really tend to 0? Let's see. From the Prime Number Theorem, p_n ≈ n log n, so p_{n+1} ≈ (n+1) log(n+1). Then, p_{n+1}/p_n ≈ (n+1)/(n) * log(n+1)/log n ≈ (1 + 1/n)(1 + 1/(n log n)) as before. So, log(p_{n+1}/p_n) ≈ log(1 + 1/n) + log(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ 1/n - 1/(2n^2) + 1/(n log n) - 1/(2n^2 log^2 n) + ... So, the leading terms are 1/n + 1/(n log n). Therefore, log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) ≈ 1/n + 1/(n log n). Which indeed tends to 0 as n approaches infinity. Therefore, [log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n)] / log(p_n) ≈ [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n]. The numerator is O(1/n), and the denominator is O(log n), so the whole fraction is O(1/(n log n)) which tends to 0. Therefore, log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n) = 1 + o(1) as n tends to infinity, so the limit is 1.

Alternatively, we can use the fact that if a_n → ∞ and a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, then log a_{n+1}/log a_n → 1. Let me check if that's a general result. Suppose a_n is a sequence tending to infinity, and a_{n+1}/a_n → 1. Then, log a_{n+1}/log a_n = [log a_n + log(1 + (a_{n+1}-a_n)/a_n)] / log a_n = 1 + [log(1 + (a_{n+1}-a_n)/a_n)] / log a_n. The term [log(1 + (a_{n+1}-a_n)/a_n)] is approximately (a_{n+1}-a_n)/a_n for large n, since log(1 + x) ≈ x when x is small. Therefore, [log(a_{n+1}) - log(a_n)] / log a_n ≈ (a_{n+1}-a_n)/a_n / log a_n. If a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, then (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n = (a_{n+1}/a_n - 1) → 0. So, the numerator of the fraction tends to 0, and the denominator log a_n tends to infinity. Therefore, the entire fraction tends to 0, so log a_{n+1}/log a_n → 1. 

Therefore, applying this general result to primes, since p_n → ∞ and p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, then log p_{n+1}/log p_n → 1. So, the answer should be yes, the limit is 1. But let me verify this with some examples. Let's take primes. For example, take p_n as the nth prime. Let's compute log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n) for large n. For example, take n = 10^6. The 10^6th prime is approximately 15,485,863 (I might need to check the exact value, but roughly n log n, which for n=10^6 is 10^6 * log(10^6) = 10^6 * 13.8155 ≈ 13,815,500. So, p_n ≈ 13,815,500. Then p_{n+1} would be roughly 13,815,500 + (log p_n + 1) ≈ 13,815,500 + 13.8155 + 1 ≈ 13,815,514.8. So, log p_n ≈ log(13,815,500) ≈ log(13.8155*10^6) = log(13.8155) + log(10^6) ≈ 2.628 + 13.8155 ≈ 16.4435. Similarly, log p_{n+1} ≈ log(13,815,514.8) ≈ same as log p_n + log(1 + 13.8/13,815,500) ≈ 16.4435 + 0.000999 ≈ 16.4445. Then, the ratio would be approximately 16.4445 / 16.4435 ≈ 1.00006. So, very close to 1, and as n increases, the difference becomes even smaller. So, this numerical example supports the conclusion.

Therefore, putting it all together, even though the primes are getting spaced further apart, their logarithms' ratio still approaches 1 because the growth rate of the primes is such that the relative increase in their logs becomes negligible as n grows. So, the final answer should be that the limit is indeed 1.

","Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that the limit as n approaches infinity of p_{n+1}/p_n is 1, where p_k is the sequence of prime numbers, I need to determine if it follows that the limit as n approaches infinity of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) is also 1. The question is whether the convergence of the ratio of consecutive primes to 1 implies the convergence of the ratio of their logarithms to 1.

Hmm, let me start by recalling some basic facts about prime numbers. The Prime Number Theorem tells us that the nth prime p_n is approximately n log n for large n. So, p_n ~ n log n. Maybe I can use this approximation to analyze the given limits.

First, let's look at the given limit: lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1. If p_n ~ n log n, then p_{n+1} ~ (n+1) log(n+1). Let's compute the ratio:

p_{n+1}/p_n ≈ [(n+1) log(n+1)] / [n log n] = (1 + 1/n) * [log(n+1)/log n]

As n approaches infinity, 1 + 1/n approaches 1, and log(n+1)/log n also approaches 1 because log(n+1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n, so the ratio becomes approximately 1 + 1/(n log n), which indeed tends to 1. So, the given limit is consistent with the Prime Number Theorem approximation.

Now, the question is about the limit of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n). Let's use the same approximation. If p_n ~ n log n, then log(p_n) ≈ log(n log n) = log n + log log n. Similarly, log(p_{n+1}) ≈ log((n+1) log(n+1)) = log(n+1) + log log(n+1).

So, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) ≈ [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. Let's analyze this.

First, log(n+1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n. Similarly, log log(n+1) = log(log n + log(1 + 1/n)) ≈ log log n + [1/(n log n)] using a Taylor expansion for log(log n + x) where x is small compared to log n.

Therefore, the numerator becomes approximately log n + 1/n + log log n + 1/(n log n), and the denominator is log n + log log n. So, the ratio is approximately [log n + log log n + 1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n] = 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n].

As n approaches infinity, the numerator of the fraction in the second term is dominated by 1/n, and the denominator is log n + log log n, which grows to infinity. Therefore, the entire fraction [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n] tends to zero. Hence, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) approaches 1. So, based on the Prime Number Theorem approximation, the limit should indeed be 1.

But wait, the problem states that the limit of p_{n+1}/p_n is 1. Is this necessarily equivalent to the Prime Number Theorem? Or is there a possibility that even if p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, the difference p_{n+1} - p_n could be larger, which might affect the logarithmic ratio?

Let me think. The limit of p_{n+1}/p_n being 1 tells us that the primes are getting closer in relative terms. However, the difference between consecutive primes can still grow. For example, even though the ratio tends to 1, the difference could be growing like log p_n, which is consistent with the Prime Number Theorem. In that case, the logarithm of p_{n+1} - p_n would be log log p_n, so log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) = log(1 + (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n) ≈ (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n, which would tend to zero, making log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) tend to zero. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1 + [log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n)]/log(p_n), and since the numerator of the added term tends to zero, the whole ratio would tend to 1.

But wait, even if p_{n+1} - p_n grows, as long as (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n tends to zero, then log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) ≈ (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n, which would also tend to zero. Therefore, even if the difference grows, as long as it's sublinear in p_n, the logarithmic difference would still tend to zero. Therefore, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) would still tend to 1.

But the problem states that lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1, which is given. Is that sufficient to conclude that log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) tends to 1?

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to use the given limit to show the desired conclusion without relying on the Prime Number Theorem. Let's try to approach this more directly.

Given that p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, let's denote q_n = p_n. Then, q_{n+1}/q_n → 1. We need to show that log q_{n+1}/log q_n → 1.

Let me write log q_{n+1}/log q_n = 1 + [log q_{n+1} - log q_n]/log q_n. Let's denote the difference term as [log(q_{n+1}/q_n)] / log q_n. Since log(q_{n+1}/q_n) = log(1 + (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n) ≈ (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n when q_{n+1} - q_n is small compared to q_n. But even if q_{n+1} - q_n is not necessarily small, as long as (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n → 0, then log(q_{n+1}/q_n) ≈ (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n, and hence [log(q_{n+1}/q_n)] / log q_n ≈ [(q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n] / log q_n. If (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n → 0, then this ratio tends to zero, hence the whole expression tends to 1.

But wait, the given condition is that q_{n+1}/q_n → 1, which is equivalent to (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n → 0. Therefore, that would imply that [log(q_{n+1}/q_n)] / log q_n → 0, hence log q_{n+1}/log q_n → 1. Therefore, under the assumption that (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n → 0, which is equivalent to q_{n+1}/q_n → 1, then log q_{n+1}/log q_n → 1.

Wait, but is the converse true? If q_{n+1}/q_n → 1, then (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n = (q_{n+1}/q_n - 1) → 0. So yes, that's exactly what is given. Therefore, since (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n → 0, then log(q_{n+1}) - log(q_n) = log(q_{n+1}/q_n) ≈ (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n, which tends to zero. Therefore, log(q_{n+1})/log(q_n) = 1 + [log(q_{n+1}) - log(q_n)]/log(q_n). The numerator of the added term tends to zero, and the denominator log(q_n) tends to infinity, so the whole term tends to zero. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1.

Therefore, regardless of the behavior of the difference q_{n+1} - q_n, as long as q_{n+1}/q_n → 1, then log(q_{n+1})/log(q_n) → 1. Therefore, the answer should be yes, the limit is 1.

But wait, let me check if there are any subtleties here. For example, even if q_{n+1}/q_n → 1, the difference q_{n+1} - q_n could be growing, but as long as (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n → 0, then log(q_{n+1}/q_n) = log(1 + (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n) ≈ (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n - [(q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n]^2 / 2 + ..., which for small (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n is approximately (q_{n+1} - q_n)/q_n. Therefore, even if the difference grows, as long as it's o(q_n), the logarithmic difference will still be o(1), hence the ratio log(q_{n+1})/log(q_n) will tend to 1.

Therefore, the conclusion is that if lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1, then lim_{n→∞} log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1.

But wait, let me test this with an example. Suppose we have a sequence where p_{n+1}/p_n approaches 1, but p_{n+1} - p_n is, say, sqrt(p_n). Then (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n = 1/sqrt(p_n) → 0, so the given limit holds. Then log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) ≈ (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n = 1/sqrt(p_n). Then log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = [log(p_n) + 1/sqrt(p_n)] / log(p_n) = 1 + 1/(sqrt(p_n) log p_n) → 1. So even in this case, the ratio tends to 1.

Another example: suppose p_{n+1} = p_n + log p_n. Then (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n = log p_n / p_n → 0, so the given limit holds. Then log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = [log(p_n) + log(1 + log p_n / p_n)] / log p_n ≈ 1 + [log(1 + log p_n / p_n)] / log p_n ≈ 1 + [log p_n / p_n] / log p_n = 1 + 1/p_n → 1. So again, the ratio tends to 1.

What if the difference p_{n+1} - p_n is larger? For example, suppose p_{n+1} = p_n + sqrt(p_n). Then (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n = 1/sqrt(p_n) → 0. Then log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = [log(p_n) + log(1 + 1/sqrt(p_n))] / log p_n ≈ 1 + [1/sqrt(p_n) - 1/(2 p_n) + ...]/log p_n, which still tends to 1.

Alternatively, if the difference is p_n^{1/2}, which is the same as the previous example.

So in all these cases, even when the difference is growing (but sublinear), the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) tends to 1. Therefore, the conclusion seems to hold.

But wait, another angle: suppose that p_{n+1} = p_n + c for some constant c. Then (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n = c/p_n → 0, so the given limit holds. Then log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = [log(p_n) + log(1 + c/p_n)] / log p_n ≈ 1 + [c/p_n]/log p_n → 1.

Therefore, regardless of how the difference grows, as long as it's o(p_n), the ratio of the logarithms will tend to 1. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But let me check if there's a mathematical theorem that supports this. For example, if a_n / a_{n+1} → 1, then log a_{n+1} / log a_n → 1. Is this a known result?

Suppose that a_n is a sequence such that a_{n+1}/a_n → 1. Then, does log a_{n+1}/log a_n → 1?

Let’s consider the definition. Let’s denote r_n = a_{n+1}/a_n. Then, r_n → 1. Then log a_{n+1} = log (a_n r_n) = log a_n + log r_n. Therefore, log a_{n+1}/log a_n = 1 + log r_n / log a_n.

Now, since r_n → 1, log r_n = log(1 + (r_n - 1)) ≈ r_n - 1 - (r_n -1)^2 / 2 + ... ≈ r_n - 1 when r_n is close to 1. Therefore, log r_n ≈ r_n - 1. Therefore, log a_{n+1}/log a_n ≈ 1 + (r_n -1)/log a_n. If r_n -1 → 0, then (r_n -1)/log a_n → 0 provided that log a_n → ∞, which it does if a_n → ∞. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1.

Therefore, under the assumption that a_n → ∞ and r_n = a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, then log a_{n+1}/log a_n → 1.

In our problem, the primes p_n do tend to infinity, and we are given that p_{n+1}/p_n →1. Therefore, applying the above reasoning, log p_{n+1}/log p_n →1.

Therefore, the answer is yes.

But wait, let me check if there's a possible case where even if a_{n+1}/a_n →1, log a_{n+1}/log a_n does not tend to 1. For example, if a_n is a sequence where a_{n+1} = a_n + 1. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 + 1/a_n →1. Then log a_{n+1}/log a_n = log(a_n +1)/log a_n ≈1 + [1/(a_n log a_n)] →1. So that works.

Another example: suppose a_n = n^k for some k>0. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = (n+1)^k /n^k ≈1 + k/n →1. Then log a_{n+1}/log a_n = log((n+1)^k)/log(n^k) = k log(n+1)/k log n ≈1. So again, it works.

Therefore, in general, if a_n is a sequence tending to infinity and a_{n+1}/a_n →1, then log a_{n+1}/log a_n →1. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

Therefore, in the context of primes, since p_n tends to infinity and p_{n+1}/p_n →1, then log p_{n+1}/log p_n must also tend to 1.

Therefore, the conclusion is that yes, the limit is 1.

","Okay, let's try to figure out if the given limit condition implies the logarithmic limit. The problem states that the limit of p_{n+1}/p_n as n approaches infinity is 1, and we need to determine whether this implies that the limit of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) is also 1. Hmm, primes... logarithms... limits... I remember some number theory here. 

First, I know that the Prime Number Theorem tells us that the nth prime p_n is approximately n log n for large n. So, p_n ≈ n log n. If that's the case, then the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n would be approximately (n+1 log(n+1)) / (n log n). Simplifying that, we get (1 + 1/n) * (log(n+1)/log n). As n approaches infinity, 1 + 1/n approaches 1, and log(n+1)/log n approaches 1 as well because log(n+1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n, and dividing by log n gives 1 + 1/(n log n). So, the entire ratio approaches 1. That aligns with the given condition. But does this help us with the logarithmic ratio?

Wait, the question is about the ratio of the logarithms. So, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n). If p_{n+1} ≈ p_n, then log(p_{n+1}) ≈ log(p_n), so their ratio should approach 1. But is that always the case? Let me think. Suppose p_{n+1} is close to p_n, but maybe not exactly equal. For example, if p_{n+1} = p_n + k for some k that grows with n, but k/n tends to 0. Then log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n + k) ≈ log(p_n) + log(1 + k/p_n). Since k/p_n tends to 0, log(1 + k/p_n) ≈ k/p_n. So, log(p_{n+1}) ≈ log(p_n) + k/p_n. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) ≈ 1 + (k/(p_n log p_n)). If k/p_n tends to 0, then the ratio tends to 1. But does the given condition that p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1 imply that k/p_n tends to 0?

Wait, the given condition is p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, which means that p_{n+1} = p_n + o(p_n). So, the difference p_{n+1} - p_n is o(p_n). Therefore, k = o(p_n), so k/p_n → 0. Then, according to the earlier approximation, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) ≈ 1 + (k/(p_n log p_n)) → 1 + 0 = 1. Therefore, does that mean that the logarithmic ratio also tends to 1?

But wait, maybe there's a case where the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, but the logarithmic ratio doesn't? For example, maybe if the difference between consecutive primes is not just o(p_n) but grows faster? Wait, but if p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, then the difference p_{n+1} - p_n = p_n (p_{n+1}/p_n - 1) → 0 as n → ∞. So, the difference must go to zero. Therefore, the difference is o(p_n). Therefore, k = o(p_n), so the term k/(p_n log p_n) is o(1/log p_n), which tends to 0. Therefore, the logarithmic ratio should indeed approach 1. So, is the answer yes?

But wait, let me test with an example. Suppose we have a sequence where p_{n+1} = p_n + 1 for all n. Then, p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + 1/p_n, which does go to 1 as n → ∞. Then, log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n + 1) ≈ log(p_n) + 1/p_n. So, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) ≈ 1 + (1/p_n log p_n). But 1/(p_n log p_n) tends to 0 because p_n grows like n log n, so log p_n grows like log n + log log n, so 1/(p_n log p_n) ≈ 1/(n log n (log n + log log n)) which is 1/(n log^2 n + ...), which definitely tends to 0. So, the ratio approaches 1. 

Another example: suppose p_{n+1} = p_n + k, where k is a constant. But primes can't be that. The difference between consecutive primes can be constant only if they are primes separated by a constant, like twin primes with difference 2. But twin primes become less frequent, and the difference can't be a fixed constant for all n. So, maybe not a good example. 

Alternatively, consider a sequence where the difference k_n grows very slowly, say k_n = log p_n. Then, p_{n+1} = p_n + log p_n. Then, p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + log p_n / p_n, which tends to 1 because log p_n / p_n → 0. Then, log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n + log p_n) ≈ log p_n + log(1 + log p_n / p_n) ≈ log p_n + (log p_n)/p_n. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) ≈ 1 + (log p_n)/p_n * (1/log p_n) ) = 1 + 1/p_n → 1. So, even if the difference is log p_n, the ratio still approaches 1. 

Wait, but is there a case where even though p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, the logarithmic ratio doesn't? Let's think. Suppose that p_{n+1} = p_n + c for some constant c. Then, as n increases, p_n increases, so c/p_n tends to 0. Then, log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n + c) ≈ log p_n + c/p_n. Therefore, the ratio is 1 + (c/(p_n log p_n)) → 1. So, even if the difference is constant, the ratio still goes to 1. But in reality, primes can't have a constant difference for all n, because primes become less dense, and the gaps between primes increase on average. However, there are infinitely many primes with difference 2 (twin primes), but their density decreases. 

Alternatively, consider a sequence where the difference k_n is such that k_n = p_n^{1 - ε} for some ε > 0. Then, p_{n+1} = p_n + p_n^{1 - ε} = p_n(1 + p_n^{-ε}). Then, p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + p_n^{-ε} → 1 as n → ∞. Then, log(p_{n+1}) = log p_n + log(1 + p_n^{-ε}) ≈ log p_n + p_n^{-ε}. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log p_n ≈ 1 + p_n^{-ε}/log p_n. Since p_n grows like n log n, log p_n grows like log n + log log n. Therefore, p_n^{-ε}/log p_n ≈ (n log n)^{-ε}/(log n) = n^{-ε} (log n)^{-ε}/(log n) = n^{-ε} (log n)^{-ε -1}, which tends to 0. So, the ratio still approaches 1. 

Wait, so in all these cases, even when the difference between consecutive primes is some function that grows, as long as the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, the logarithmic ratio also tends to 1. Is there any way to construct a sequence where p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, but log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) does not approach 1? Let me try.

Suppose we have a sequence where p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + a_n, where a_n → 0 but log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) doesn't approach 1. Let's see. If p_{n+1} = p_n(1 + a_n), then log(p_{n+1}) = log p_n + log(1 + a_n) ≈ log p_n + a_n - a_n^2/2 + ... So, log(p_{n+1})/log p_n ≈ 1 + (a_n - a_n^2/2 + ...)/log p_n. If a_n is such that a_n / log p_n does not tend to 0, then the ratio may not approach 1. For example, suppose a_n = 1/log p_n. Then, p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + 1/log p_n. Then, log(p_{n+1})/log p_n ≈ 1 + (1/log p_n)/log p_n = 1 + 1/(log p_n)^2, which does approach 1. So, even in this case, the ratio approaches 1. 

Alternatively, take a_n = 1/(log p_n)^{1/2}. Then, log(p_{n+1})/log p_n ≈ 1 + 1/(log p_n)^{3/2} → 1. Hmm. It seems challenging to find such a sequence. Wait, but perhaps if a_n = c / log p_n for some constant c. Then, log(p_{n+1})/log p_n ≈ 1 + c / (log p_n)^2 → 1. 

Wait, but maybe if a_n is not tending to zero, but the given condition is that a_n tends to zero. So, in all cases, as long as a_n → 0, regardless of how slowly, then the logarithmic ratio would also tend to 1. Because even if a_n is 1/(log p_n), then the term added to the ratio is 1/(log p_n)^2, which still tends to 0. So, in general, if p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, then log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) → 1. Therefore, the conclusion would be yes, it does follow.

But wait, let's check with the Prime Number Theorem. The nth prime is approximately n log n. So, log(p_n) ≈ log(n log n) = log n + log log n. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) ≈ [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. Let's expand this. Let n be large, so n+1 ≈ n. Then, log(n+1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n. Similarly, log log(n+1) = log(log n + log(1 + 1/n)) ≈ log log n + log(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ log log n + 1/(n log n). Therefore, the numerator becomes log n + 1/n + log log n + 1/(n log n), and the denominator is log n + log log n. Therefore, the ratio is approximately [ (log n + log log n) + 1/n + 1/(n log n) ] / (log n + log log n) = 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / (log n + log log n). As n → ∞, the numerator of the added term is O(1/n), and the denominator is O(log n). Therefore, the entire added term is O(1/(n log n)) → 0. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1. 

So, according to the Prime Number Theorem approximation, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) does approach 1. Therefore, this supports the conclusion that the limit is indeed 1. 

But wait, the problem doesn't specify that we can use the Prime Number Theorem. The question is more general: given that p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, does that imply log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) → 1? Is this a general result for any sequence where a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, does log a_{n+1}/log a_n → 1? 

Let me consider a general sequence a_n where a_{n+1}/a_n → 1. Then, log a_{n+1} = log a_n + log(1 + (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n) ≈ log a_n + (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n. Therefore, log a_{n+1}/log a_n ≈ 1 + (a_{n+1} - a_n)/(a_n log a_n). If a_{n+1} - a_n is o(a_n), then (a_{n+1} - a_n)/(a_n log a_n) is o(1/log a_n), which tends to 0. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1. Therefore, this is a general result: if a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, then log a_{n+1}/log a_n → 1. 

Wait, but is this always the case? Suppose that a_n is such that a_{n+1} - a_n = c, a constant. Then, a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 + c/a_n → 1 as n → ∞. Then, log a_{n+1}/log a_n ≈ 1 + c/(a_n log a_n) → 1. So, even if the difference is constant, the ratio still tends to 1. 

Another example: let a_n = n. Then, a_{n+1}/a_n = (n+1)/n → 1. Then, log a_{n+1}/log a_n = log(n+1)/log n ≈ (log n + log(1 + 1/n))/log n ≈ 1 + (1/n)/log n → 1. 

Another example: let a_n = n^k for some k > 0. Then, a_{n+1}/a_n = (n+1)^k /n^k → 1. Then, log a_{n+1}/log a_n = log(n+1)^k / log n^k = k log(n+1)/k log n = log(n+1)/log n → 1. 

So, in all these cases, the ratio tends to 1. Therefore, it seems that the conclusion is yes, the limit does follow. 

Therefore, going back to the original problem, since the primes satisfy p_{n+1}/p_n → 1 (as per the given condition), then log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) must also approach 1. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But let me check if there's a possible counterexample. Suppose that a sequence a_n is such that a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, but log a_{n+1}/log a_n does not approach 1. Let's try to construct such a sequence. 

Suppose that a_{n} = e^{b_n}, where b_n is a sequence that converges to infinity. Then, log a_{n} = b_n. Suppose that b_{n+1}/b_n → 1, but b_{n+1}/b_n = 1 + c/n, where c is a constant. Then, log a_{n+1}/log a_n = b_{n+1}/b_n = 1 + c/n → 1. So, even if the ratio of the logarithms tends to 1, it's still 1. 

Wait, but what if b_{n+1} = b_n + 1. Then, log a_{n+1}/log a_n = (b_n +1)/b_n = 1 + 1/b_n. If b_n → ∞, then 1/b_n → 0, so the ratio still tends to 1. 

Alternatively, suppose that a_n is such that a_{n+1} = a_n + sqrt(a_n). Then, a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 + 1/sqrt(a_n) → 1. Then, log a_{n+1}/log a_n ≈ 1 + (1/sqrt(a_n)) / (log a_n). Since a_n grows, sqrt(a_n)/log a_n tends to infinity, so 1/(sqrt(a_n) log a_n) tends to 0. Therefore, the ratio still tends to 1. 

Alternatively, take a_n = e^{log n + log log n} = n log n. Then, log a_n = log n + log log n. Then, a_{n+1} = (n+1) log(n+1) ≈ n log n (1 + 1/n + log(1 + 1/n)). Then, log a_{n+1} ≈ log n + log log n + 1/n + 1/(n log n). Therefore, log a_{n+1}/log a_n ≈ 1 + (1/n + 1/(n log n)) / (log n + log log n) → 1. 

It seems impossible to find a sequence where a_{n+1}/a_n → 1 but log a_{n+1}/log a_n does not approach 1. Therefore, the conclusion is that the given condition does imply the logarithmic limit. 

Therefore, the answer is yes, the limit does follow.

Given that \\( \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{p_{n+1}}{p_n} = 1 \\), where \\( p_k \\) denotes the sequence of prime numbers, we need to determine if it follows that \\( \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\log(p_{n+1})}{\\log(p_n)} = 1 \\).

","Okay, let's try to figure out whether if the limit of the ratio of consecutive primes approaches 1, then the limit of the ratio of their natural logarithms also approaches 1. Hmm. So, we know that as n goes to infinity, p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1. And we need to check if log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) also tends to 1. 

First, I remember that the Prime Number Theorem tells us that the nth prime is approximately n log n. So, p_n ≈ n log n for large n. Maybe that can help. If p_n is roughly n log n, then p_{n+1} would be roughly (n+1) log(n+1). Let me write that down:

p_n ≈ n log n  
p_{n+1} ≈ (n + 1) log(n + 1)

So, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n would be approximately [(n + 1) log(n + 1)] / [n log n]. Let's simplify that:

[(n + 1)/n] * [log(n + 1)/log n] = (1 + 1/n) * [log(n + 1)/log n]

Now, the first part, (1 + 1/n), tends to 1 as n approaches infinity. The second part, [log(n + 1)/log n], we need to analyze. Let's see, log(n + 1) is log n + log(1 + 1/n). So, log(n + 1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n). Therefore, log(n + 1)/log n = 1 + [log(1 + 1/n)] / log n.

Now, log(1 + 1/n) is approximately 1/n for large n (since using the Taylor expansion, log(1 + x) ≈ x - x^2/2 + ... for small x). Therefore, [log(1 + 1/n)] / log n ≈ (1/n) / log n. Which goes to 0 as n approaches infinity because 1/n goes to 0 and log n goes to infinity. Therefore, the ratio [log(n + 1)/log n] approaches 1 + 0 = 1. So, the entire ratio p_{n+1}/p_n is approximately (1 + 1/n) * (1 + 0) which tends to 1, which matches the given condition.

But wait, the problem states that lim_{n→∞} p_{n+1}/p_n = 1, and we're supposed to see if lim_{n→∞} log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1 follows. So, maybe using the approximation from the Prime Number Theorem is a way to approach this. However, is this a valid approach? Because the Prime Number Theorem gives an asymptotic approximation, but does that mean the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1? Let me check.

Actually, according to the Prime Number Theorem, the nth prime is approximately n log n, so p_{n+1}/p_n ≈ [(n + 1) log(n + 1)] / [n log n] ≈ (1 + 1/n) * [log(n + 1)/log n]. As we saw earlier, this tends to 1. So, that's consistent with the given condition. Therefore, under the assumption that p_n is approximated by n log n, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n does indeed tend to 1.

But does that mean that log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) also tends to 1? Let's see. If p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, then we can write p_{n+1} = p_n * (1 + ε_n), where ε_n tends to 0 as n approaches infinity. Then, log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n * (1 + ε_n)) = log p_n + log(1 + ε_n). Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1 + [log(1 + ε_n)/log p_n].

Now, since ε_n tends to 0, log(1 + ε_n) ≈ ε_n - ε_n^2/2 + ... ≈ ε_n for small ε_n. Therefore, log(1 + ε_n)/log p_n ≈ ε_n / log p_n. If ε_n approaches 0 and log p_n approaches infinity, then this ratio would approach 0. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) ≈ 1 + o(1), which would imply that the limit is 1. Therefore, in this case, yes, the limit would be 1. 

But wait, is this always true? Let's think of another example. Suppose we have a sequence a_n such that a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, but log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) does not approach 1. For instance, take a_n = n. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = (n + 1)/n → 1. Then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = log(n + 1)/log n, which we already saw approaches 1. Another example: let a_n = n^k for some constant k. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = ((n + 1)/n)^k → 1, and log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = [k log(n + 1)] / [k log n] = log(n + 1)/log n → 1. Hmm, so in these cases, even though the ratio tends to 1, the logarithmic ratio also tends to 1. 

Wait, but perhaps if a_n grows sub-exponentially but not polynomially? Let's see. Suppose a_n = e^{sqrt(n)}. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = e^{sqrt(n + 1) - sqrt(n)} ≈ e^{1/(2 sqrt(n))} → 1. Then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = sqrt(n + 1)/sqrt(n) → 1. So again, the ratio tends to 1. Hmm. Maybe in all cases where a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, and a_n tends to infinity, the ratio log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) also tends to 1? 

Wait, but let's test another example. Let a_n = 2^n. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = 2 → 2, which doesn't tend to 1, so that's not a valid example. How about a_n = n! ? Then a_{n+1}/a_n = n + 1 → infinity, so that's not a valid example. Let's think of a sequence that grows slower than exponential but faster than polynomial. For example, a_n = e^{n^c} where 0 < c < 1. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = e^{(n + 1)^c - n^c}. Let's compute the exponent:

(n + 1)^c - n^c ≈ n^c (1 + c/n)^c - n^c ≈ n^c (1 + c^2/n + ...) - n^c ≈ c^2 n^{c - 1} + ... So as n→infty, the exponent tends to 0, so a_{n+1}/a_n ≈ 1 + c^2 n^{c - 1} + ... which tends to 1. Then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = [n^c + (n + 1)^c]/[n^c + ...] Wait, no. Wait, log(a_n) = log(e^{n^c}) = n^c. Similarly, log(a_{n+1}) = (n + 1)^c. Therefore, the ratio is (n + 1)^c / n^c = (1 + 1/n)^c ≈ 1 + c/n → 1. So again, the ratio tends to 1. 

Wait, so maybe in general, if a_n is a sequence that tends to infinity, and a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) → 1? 

But is this always true? Let's think of a counterexample. Suppose a_n = e^{n^{1/2}}. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = e^{(n + 1)^{1/2} - n^{1/2}} ≈ e^{1/(2 n^{1/2})} → 1. Then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = (n + 1)^{1/2}/n^{1/2} ≈ 1 + 1/(2 n^{1/2}) → 1. So again, the ratio tends to 1. 

Alternatively, suppose a_n = e^{n^{1/3}}. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = e^{(n + 1)^{1/3} - n^{1/3}} ≈ e^{1/(3 n^{2/3})} → 1. Then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = (n + 1)^{1/3}/n^{1/3} ≈ 1 + 1/(3 n^{2/3}) → 1. So again, the ratio tends to 1. 

Hmm. So perhaps in all these cases, if a_{n+1}/a_n → 1 and a_n → infinity, then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) → 1. Is there a theorem that states this?

Alternatively, maybe using logarithmic properties. If we have a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, then taking logarithms, log(a_{n+1}) - log(a_n) = log(a_{n+1}/a_n) → 0. So the difference between consecutive logarithms tends to 0. But does that imply that the ratio of the logarithms tends to 1?

Suppose we have log(a_{n+1}) - log(a_n) → 0. Then log(a_{n+1}) = log(a_n) + o(1). Therefore, log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = [log(a_n) + o(1)] / log(a_n) = 1 + o(1)/log(a_n). If log(a_n) → infinity, then this ratio tends to 1. So, as long as log(a_n) → infinity, which it does since a_n → infinity, then the ratio log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) tends to 1. Therefore, in general, if a_n is a sequence tending to infinity, and a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) → 1.

Therefore, applying this general result to primes, since p_n → infinity, and the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, it follows that log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) → 1. Hence, the answer should be yes.

But wait, let me make sure there isn't a subtlety here. For example, if the convergence of a_{n+1}/a_n to 1 is very slow, does that affect the convergence of the logarithmic ratio? Let's see. Suppose a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 + b_n, where b_n → 0. Then log(a_{n+1}) = log(a_n) + log(1 + b_n) ≈ log(a_n) + b_n. Therefore, log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) ≈ 1 + b_n / log(a_n). If b_n = o(log(a_n)), then this ratio tends to 1. But if b_n / log(a_n) doesn't tend to 0, then maybe the ratio doesn't tend to 1. However, in our case, given that a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, how fast does a_n grow? For primes, from the Prime Number Theorem, a_n ≈ n log n, so log(a_n) ≈ log n + log log n. Therefore, if b_n is such that a_{n+1} = a_n (1 + b_n), then b_n ≈ (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n. For primes, a_n ≈ n log n, so a_{n+1} - a_n ≈ (n + 1) log(n + 1) - n log n ≈ log(n + 1) + n [log(n + 1) - log n] ≈ log(n + 1) + n [log(1 + 1/n)] ≈ log n + 1 + n (1/n - 1/(2n^2) + ...) ≈ log n + 1 + 1 - 1/(2n) + ... So, a_{n+1} - a_n ≈ log n + 2 - 1/(2n) + ... Therefore, b_n ≈ (log n + 2)/n log n ≈ (log n)/n log n + 2/(n log n) ≈ 1/n + 2/(n log n). Therefore, b_n / log(a_n) ≈ (1/n + 2/(n log n)) / (log n + log log n) ≈ (1/n)/log n + ... which tends to 0. Therefore, even in this case, the ratio log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) tends to 1. 

Therefore, even if the convergence of a_{n+1}/a_n to 1 is slow, as long as a_n grows to infinity, the ratio of the logarithms will still tend to 1. Therefore, for primes, the conclusion holds. 

But just to be thorough, let's check another example where a_{n+1}/a_n → 1 but a_n grows very slowly. Let's take a_n = e^{sqrt(log n)}. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = e^{sqrt(log(n + 1)) - sqrt(log n)}. Let's compute the exponent:

sqrt(log(n + 1)) - sqrt(log n) ≈ sqrt(log n + log(1 + 1/n)) - sqrt(log n) ≈ sqrt(log n) sqrt(1 + (log(1 + 1/n))/log n) - sqrt(log n) ≈ sqrt(log n) [1 + (1/(2n log n)) - (1/(8 n^2 log^2 n)) + ... ] - sqrt(log n) ≈ sqrt(log n) [ (1/(2n log n)) - (1/(8 n^2 log^2 n)) + ... ] ≈ (1/(2n sqrt(log n))) - ... So, the exponent is approximately 1/(2n sqrt(log n)). Therefore, a_{n+1}/a_n ≈ 1 + 1/(2n sqrt(log n)) → 1. Then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = sqrt(log(n + 1))/sqrt(log n) ≈ 1 + [sqrt(log(n + 1)) - sqrt(log n)] / sqrt(log n). Compute the numerator:

sqrt(log(n + 1)) - sqrt(log n) ≈ (log(n + 1) - log n)/(2 sqrt(log n)) = [log(1 + 1/n)] / (2 sqrt(log n)) ≈ (1/(2n)) / (2 sqrt(log n)) = 1/(4n sqrt(log n)). Therefore, the ratio becomes 1 + 1/(4n sqrt(log n) sqrt(log n)) = 1 + 1/(4n log n). Which tends to 1 as n approaches infinity. Therefore, even in this case, the ratio of the logarithms tends to 1.

Therefore, it seems that whenever a_{n+1}/a_n → 1 and a_n → infinity, then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) → 1. Therefore, applying this general result to primes, since we know from the Prime Number Theorem that p_n grows approximately like n log n, which goes to infinity, and the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, it follows that log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) → 1. 

But let's verify this with some concrete numbers. Take n = 1000. The 1000th prime is around 7919. The 1001st prime is 7927. Then the ratio is 7927/7919 ≈ 1.001. The logarithms: log(7927) ≈ 8.979, log(7919) ≈ 8.978. The ratio is ≈ 8.979/8.978 ≈ 1.0001. So, even for n = 1000, the ratio of logarithms is very close to 1. For larger n, say n = 1,000,000, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n is even closer to 1, and the logarithms would be even closer. 

Therefore, based on the general argument and specific examples, it seems that the conclusion is correct. Therefore, the answer is yes, the limit does equal 1.

","Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we know that the limit of the ratio of consecutive primes as n approaches infinity is 1. That is, lim_{n→∞} (p_{n+1}/p_n) = 1. And we need to determine if it follows that the limit of the ratio of their natural logarithms is also 1. So, lim_{n→∞} log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1. Hmm, let's see.

First, I remember that the Prime Number Theorem tells us about the distribution of primes. Specifically, it says that the nth prime p_n is approximately n log n. So, p_n ~ n log n as n becomes large. Maybe that can help here. If p_n is roughly n log n, then p_{n+1} is roughly (n+1) log(n+1). Let's see if that helps us.

So, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n would be approximately [(n+1) log(n+1)] / [n log n]. Let's simplify that. The (n+1)/n part is (1 + 1/n), which tends to 1 as n goes to infinity. Then the log(n+1)/log n part. Using logarithm properties, log(n+1) = log(n(1 + 1/n)) = log n + log(1 + 1/n). So, log(n+1)/log n = [log n + log(1 + 1/n)] / log n = 1 + [log(1 + 1/n)] / log n. As n becomes large, log(1 + 1/n) is approximately 1/n - 1/(2n^2) + ... using the Taylor series expansion for log(1+x) around x=0. So, log(1 + 1/n) ≈ 1/n for large n. Therefore, [log(1 + 1/n)] / log n ≈ (1/n)/log n, which tends to 0 as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the entire ratio p_{n+1}/p_n is approximately (1 + 1/n)(1 + 0) = 1 + 1/n, which tends to 1 as n goes to infinity. That matches the given condition.

But we need to check if log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) tends to 1. Let's see. If p_n ~ n log n, then log(p_n) ~ log(n log n) = log n + log log n. Similarly, log(p_{n+1}) ~ log((n+1) log(n+1)) = log(n+1) + log log(n+1). Let's compute the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n):

[log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]

Again, let's approximate each term. log(n+1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n - 1/(2n^2) + ... So, log(n+1) - log n ≈ 1/n. Similarly, log log(n+1) - log log n = log(log n + log(1 + 1/n)) - log log n = log[log n (1 + 1/(n log n))] = log log n + log(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ log log n + 1/(n log n). Therefore, the difference between log(p_{n+1}) and log(p_n) is approximately [1/n + 1/(n log n)]. 

So, log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n) + 1/n + 1/(n log n) + ... Then, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / log(p_n). Since log(p_n) ~ log n + log log n ~ log n for large n, the denominator is approximately log n. Therefore, the ratio becomes 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / log n = 1 + [1/(n log n) + 1/(n (log n)^2)]. As n approaches infinity, both terms in the numerator go to zero, so the entire ratio tends to 1. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) → 1 as n → ∞.

Wait, but is there a more rigorous way to establish this? Maybe using the fact that if a_n → a, then log(a_{n+1}/a_n) → log(1) = 0? Wait, no, that's not directly applicable here. Wait, but if we have log(p_{n+1}/p_n) → log(1) = 0, but does that imply that log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) → 1?

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that if two sequences a_n and b_n both approach infinity, and the ratio a_n/b_n → 1, then log a_n / log b_n → 1. Is that a general result?

Let me think. Suppose that lim_{n→∞} a_n / b_n = 1, and both a_n and b_n go to infinity. Then, does lim_{n→∞} log a_n / log b_n = 1? Let's see. If a_n / b_n = 1 + ε_n, where ε_n → 0 as n → ∞. Then, log a_n = log b_n + log(1 + ε_n) ≈ log b_n + ε_n. Therefore, log a_n / log b_n = 1 + ε_n / log b_n. Since ε_n → 0 and log b_n → ∞, then ε_n / log b_n → 0. Therefore, log a_n / log b_n → 1. So, in general, if a_n and b_n both go to infinity and a_n / b_n → 1, then log a_n / log b_n → 1.

But in our case, p_{n+1} and p_n both go to infinity, and their ratio tends to 1. Therefore, by this general result, log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n) should tend to 1. Therefore, the answer should be yes, the limit is 1.

But wait, let me check if there are any subtleties here. For example, if the convergence of a_n / b_n to 1 is too slow, does that affect the ratio of their logarithms? For instance, suppose a_n = b_n + c_n where c_n is very small but such that a_n / b_n = 1 + c_n / b_n. Then, log a_n = log b_n + log(1 + c_n / b_n) ≈ log b_n + c_n / b_n. Then, log a_n / log b_n = 1 + (c_n / b_n) / log b_n. If c_n grows faster than log b_n, then this might not go to 1. But in our case, since p_{n+1} - p_n is at most 2 (for twin primes, but actually, the gap between primes can be larger, but on average, the gaps are O(log p_n)). So, p_{n+1} - p_n is o(p_n) because the average gap is about log p_n, and log p_n is o(p_n). Therefore, c_n = p_{n+1} - p_n is o(p_n), so c_n / p_n → 0. Therefore, log(1 + c_n / p_n) ≈ c_n / p_n. So, log p_{n+1} = log p_n + log(1 + c_n / p_n) ≈ log p_n + c_n / p_n. Therefore, log p_{n+1} / log p_n = 1 + (c_n / p_n) / log p_n. Since c_n / p_n = o(1) and 1 / log p_n is also o(1), their product is o(1), so the ratio tends to 1. Therefore, this seems to hold.

Alternatively, using the Prime Number Theorem, which gives a more precise approximation. The nth prime is approximately n log n, so p_n ~ n log n. Then, p_{n+1} ~ (n+1) log(n+1). Let's take the ratio:

p_{n+1}/p_n ~ [(n+1) log(n+1)] / [n log n] = (1 + 1/n) * [log(n+1)/log n]

As before, log(n+1)/log n = [log n + log(1 + 1/n)] / log n = 1 + [log(1 + 1/n)] / log n ≈ 1 + (1/n)/log n

Therefore, p_{n+1}/p_n ≈ (1 + 1/n)(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ 1 + 1/n + 1/(n log n)

Therefore, log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n) + log(1 + 1/n + 1/(n log n)) ≈ log(p_n) + (1/n + 1/(n log n))

Therefore, log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n) ≈ [log(p_n) + 1/n + 1/(n log n)] / log(p_n) = 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / log(p_n)

Since log(p_n) ~ log n + log log n ~ log n, this becomes 1 + [1/(n log n) + 1/(n (log n)^2)] which tends to 1 as n approaches infinity. Therefore, the ratio of the logarithms tends to 1.

So, putting it all together, using the Prime Number Theorem and approximating the logarithms, we see that the ratio log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n) does indeed approach 1. Therefore, the answer should be yes, the limit is 1.

But let me check if there's another way to see this, perhaps using properties of logarithms and limits. For example, if lim_{n→∞} (p_{n+1}/p_n) = 1, then log(p_{n+1}/p_n) = log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) → log(1) = 0. But how does that relate to the ratio log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n)?

Suppose that log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n) + ε_n, where ε_n → 0 as n → ∞. Then, log(p_{n+1}) / log(p_n) = 1 + ε_n / log(p_n). If ε_n → 0 and log(p_n) → ∞, then ε_n / log(p_n) → 0, so the ratio tends to 1. Therefore, even more generally, if the difference between log(p_{n+1}) and log(p_n) tends to zero faster than log(p_n) tends to infinity, then the ratio will approach 1. Since log(p_n) → ∞ and ε_n = log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) = log(1 + (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n) ≈ (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n by the Taylor approximation for log(1+x) ≈ x when x is small. Since (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n → 0 as n → ∞, ε_n ≈ (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n → 0. Therefore, ε_n / log(p_n) ≈ [(p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n] / log(p_n). Since (p_{n+1} - p_n)/p_n is O(1/log p_n) due to the average gap being ~ log p_n, then ε_n / log(p_n) is O(1/(log p_n)^2) which tends to 0. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1.

So, all these different approaches seem to lead to the conclusion that the ratio of the logarithms of consecutive primes does indeed approach 1 as n goes to infinity. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

","Okay, let's see. The problem is about limits involving prime numbers. We know that the limit of the ratio of consecutive primes as n approaches infinity is 1. So, lim_{n→∞} (p_{n+1}/p_n) = 1. And we need to determine if this implies that the limit of the ratio of their natural logarithms is also 1. That is, lim_{n→∞} (log p_{n+1}/log p_n) = 1.

Hmm. Let me start by recalling some properties of primes. The Prime Number Theorem tells us that the nth prime p_n is approximately equal to n log n for large n. So, p_n ~ n log n. But wait, the exact approximation is p_n ≈ n (log n + log log n), but for the purposes of limits, maybe the leading term is sufficient.

But the problem gives us that the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1. So, even though primes are not consecutive integers, their ratio approaches 1 as n becomes large. That suggests that the primes are getting closer to each other in terms of their ratio, not just their difference.

Now, we need to see if the ratio of their logarithms also approaches 1. Let's denote r_n = p_{n+1}/p_n. The given condition is lim_{n→∞} r_n = 1. We want to find lim_{n→∞} (log p_{n+1}/log p_n) = lim (log (r_n p_n)) / log p_n = lim (log r_n + log p_n) / log p_n = lim 1 + log r_n / log p_n.

Since we know that r_n → 1, log r_n → 0. So, the question is whether log r_n / log p_n tends to 0. If that's the case, then the entire expression would approach 1. But does log r_n / log p_n → 0?

Let me think. Since r_n → 1, we can write r_n = 1 + ε_n, where ε_n → 0. Then, log r_n = log(1 + ε_n) ≈ ε_n - ε_n^2/2 + ... for small ε_n. So, log r_n ≈ ε_n. Therefore, log r_n / log p_n ≈ ε_n / log p_n. Now, we need to see if ε_n / log p_n → 0.

But to evaluate this, we need to know how ε_n behaves compared to log p_n. Since r_n = p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, the difference p_{n+1} - p_n is much smaller than p_n. In fact, it's known that the gap between consecutive primes is much smaller than p_n^(θ) for θ < 1, but the exact rate is not specified here. However, even if the gap is, say, O(p_n^θ) for some θ < 1, then p_{n+1} - p_n = O(p_n^θ). Then, p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + O(p_n^{θ - 1}). Therefore, log r_n = log(1 + O(p_n^{θ - 1})) ≈ O(p_n^{θ - 1}). So, log r_n / log p_n ≈ O(p_n^{θ - 1} / log p_n). Since p_n grows faster than log p_n, and θ - 1 is negative (because θ < 1), this term would go to zero. Therefore, the ratio log r_n / log p_n tends to zero, so the original limit would be 1 + 0 = 1.

But wait, is that necessarily true? Let's check with the Prime Number Theorem. If p_n ≈ n log n, then p_{n+1} ≈ (n+1) log(n+1). Then, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n ≈ [(n+1)/n] * [log(n+1)/log n]. The first term (n+1)/n approaches 1, and the second term log(n+1)/log n approaches 1 as well. Therefore, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n approaches 1, which matches the given condition. Then, log p_{n+1}/log p_n ≈ [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. The dominant terms here are log(n+1)/log n, which approaches 1, and the other terms are lower order. So, again, the ratio should approach 1.

But let me verify this more carefully. Let's take p_n ≈ n log n. Then, log p_n ≈ log n + log log n. So, log p_{n+1} ≈ log(n+1) + log log(n+1). Then, the ratio log p_{n+1}/log p_n ≈ [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. Let's split this into two parts: [log(n+1)/log n] * [1 + (log log(n+1))/log(n+1)] / [1 + (log log n)/log n]. As n becomes large, log(n+1)/log n approaches 1, and the other terms (log log terms divided by log n) also approach 0. Therefore, the entire expression approaches 1*1 = 1.

Therefore, even with the approximation p_n ≈ n log n, the ratio of the logarithms tends to 1. So, this suggests that the conclusion is true.

But wait, let's think if there's a possible case where even though p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, the logarithms could have a ratio not approaching 1. Suppose that the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n approaches 1, but the logarithms could differ by a constant factor. However, since both primes are tending to infinity, their logarithms are also tending to infinity. For the ratio of two quantities both tending to infinity, even if they differ by a term that is negligible compared to their own magnitudes, the ratio would still approach 1. For example, if log p_{n+1} = log p_n + o(1), then log p_{n+1}/log p_n = 1 + o(1)/log p_n → 1. Since o(1)/log p_n tends to 0.

But in our case, log p_{n+1} - log p_n = log(p_{n+1}/p_n) = log(1 + ε_n) ≈ ε_n. So, the difference is approximately ε_n, which is o(1). Therefore, log p_{n+1}/log p_n = 1 + ε_n / log p_n. Since ε_n → 0 and log p_n → ∞, the second term is o(1)/∞, which is o(1). Therefore, the entire expression tends to 1.

Therefore, under the given condition lim_{n→∞} (p_{n+1}/p_n) = 1, it does follow that lim_{n→∞} (log p_{n+1}/log p_n) = 1.

But let's check with some examples. Let's take p_n as the nth prime. For example, for large primes, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n is approaching 1. Let's take p_n ≈ n log n. Then, log p_n ≈ log n + log log n. Then, log p_{n+1} ≈ log(n+1) + log log(n+1). The ratio would be [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. As n becomes large, log(n+1) ≈ log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n. Similarly, log log(n+1) ≈ log log n + log(1 + 1/n log n) ≈ log log n + 1/(n log n). Therefore, the ratio becomes [log n + 1/n + log log n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n] = 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n]. The numerator of the fraction is O(1/n), and the denominator is Ω(log n). Therefore, the entire fraction is O(1/(n log n)) → 0. Hence, the ratio tends to 1.

Alternatively, if we use the approximation that p_n is asymptotic to n log n, then log p_n is asymptotic to log n + log log n. Therefore, the difference between successive terms in log p_n is approximately log(n+1) + log log(n+1) - log n - log log n ≈ (log n + 1/n) + (log log n + 1/(n log n)) - log n - log log n ≈ 1/n + 1/(n log n), which is o(1). Therefore, the ratio log p_{n+1}/log p_n ≈ 1 + o(1)/log p_n → 1.

Another way to think about it: If the ratio of the primes tends to 1, then the primes are getting denser and closer in ratio. However, their logarithms are also growing, but the relative difference in logarithms becomes negligible as the primes become large. Therefore, the ratio of the logarithms should also tend to 1.

But wait, let's consider a different example. Suppose that p_{n+1} = p_n + c for some constant c. Then, p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + c/p_n → 1 as n→∞. However, log p_{n+1}/log p_n = log(p_n + c)/log p_n = log[p_n(1 + c/p_n)] / log p_n = [log p_n + log(1 + c/p_n)] / log p_n = 1 + [c/p_n] / log p_n. Since c/p_n → 0 and log p_n → ∞, the second term is o(1)/∞ → 0. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1. So even in this case, it works.

But primes are not equally spaced, but the ratio tending to 1 suggests that the spacing is becoming relatively small compared to the primes themselves. So, even if the absolute spacing is a constant, the relative spacing (ratio) tends to 1. But in reality, the spacing between primes is not a constant; it's known that the gaps between consecutive primes can be as large as, for example, O(p_n^θ) for some θ < 1, but still, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1.

Therefore, regardless of the exact behavior of the gaps (as long as the ratio tends to 1), the ratio of the logarithms should tend to 1.

Alternatively, let's consider the general case. Suppose we have a sequence a_n such that lim_{n→∞} a_{n+1}/a_n = 1. Then, does lim_{n→∞} log a_{n+1}/log a_n = 1?

Yes, under certain conditions. For example, if a_n → ∞, then log a_{n+1} - log a_n = log(a_{n+1}/a_n) ≈ (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n, assuming that a_{n+1}/a_n is close to 1. But even more precisely, if a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 + ε_n with ε_n → 0, then log a_{n+1} = log a_n + log(1 + ε_n) ≈ log a_n + ε_n - ε_n^2/2 + ... So, log a_{n+1} ≈ log a_n + ε_n. Therefore, log a_{n+1}/log a_n ≈ 1 + ε_n / log a_n. Since ε_n → 0 and log a_n → ∞ (because a_n → ∞), this tends to 1.

Therefore, in general, if a_n → ∞ and a_{n+1}/a_n → 1, then log a_{n+1}/log a_n → 1. Therefore, applying this to the primes, since p_n → ∞ and p_{n+1}/p_n → 1, it follows that log p_{n+1}/log p_n → 1.

Therefore, the conclusion is yes, the limit is 1.

","Okay, so I have this problem here: Given that the limit as n approaches infinity of p_{n+1}/p_n is 1, where p_k is the sequence of prime numbers, does it follow that the limit as n approaches infinity of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) is also 1? Hmm, let me try to work through this step by step.

First, I know that primes get larger as n increases, but their gaps also tend to increase, right? But the problem says that the ratio of consecutive primes approaches 1. That seems interesting. I recall that primes are asymptotically distributed in such a way that the nth prime is approximately n log n, according to the Prime Number Theorem. So p_n ~ n log n. Let me check that again. The Prime Number Theorem states that the number of primes less than or equal to x is approximately x / log x. But how does that relate to the nth prime?

Well, if the number of primes up to x is roughly x / log x, then the nth prime p_n should be approximately n log n. So p_n ≈ n log n. Therefore, p_{n+1} ≈ (n+1) log(n+1). Let me write that down:

p_n ≈ n log n  
p_{n+1} ≈ (n+1) log(n+1)

So, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n would be approximately [(n+1) log(n+1)] / [n log n]. Let's simplify that. Let's factor out n from numerator and denominator:

= (1 + 1/n) * [log(n+1)/log n]

As n approaches infinity, 1/n approaches 0, so (1 + 1/n) approaches 1. Then, log(n+1)/log n. Let's see, log(n+1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n. So, log(n+1)/log n ≈ 1 + 1/(n log n). Therefore, the entire ratio becomes approximately 1 + 1/(n log n) + 1/n. Wait, but combining these terms:

Wait, actually, let me do it more carefully. Let me write log(n+1) as log(n (1 + 1/n)) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n - 1/(2n^2) + ... So, up to the first order, log(n+1) ≈ log n + 1/n. Therefore, log(n+1)/log n ≈ 1 + 1/(n log n). So, putting it all together:

p_{n+1}/p_n ≈ (1 + 1/n)(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ 1 + 1/n + 1/(n log n) + 1/(n^2 log n). As n becomes very large, the dominant term is 1/n, so the ratio approaches 1. But the problem states that the ratio converges to 1, which aligns with this approximation. So that seems consistent.

Now, the question is about log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n). Let's use the approximation p_n ≈ n log n. Then log(p_n) ≈ log(n log n) = log n + log log n. Similarly, log(p_{n+1}) ≈ log((n+1) log(n+1)) = log(n+1) + log log(n+1). So, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) would be [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n].

Let me try to expand this. First, log(n+1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n. Similarly, log log(n+1) = log(log n + log(1 + 1/n)) ≈ log log n + [log(1 + 1/n)] / log n ≈ log log n + 1/(n log n). Therefore, the numerator becomes approximately log n + 1/n + log log n + 1/(n log n). The denominator is log n + log log n. So, dividing numerator and denominator:

[log n + log log n + 1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n] = 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n].

As n approaches infinity, the terms 1/n and 1/(n log n) are negligible compared to log n and log log n in the denominator. So the entire ratio tends to 1 + 0 = 1. Therefore, does that mean the limit is 1?

Wait, but let's check this again more carefully. Let me write the ratio as:

[log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]

Let me denote A = log n, B = log log n. Then, log(n+1) = A + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ A + 1/n, and log log(n+1) = log(A + log(1 + 1/n)) ≈ log A + [log(1 + 1/n)] / A ≈ log A + 1/(n A). Therefore, the numerator is approximately A + 1/n + log A + 1/(n A). The denominator is A + log A. Therefore, the ratio is approximately [A + log A + 1/n + 1/(n A)] / [A + log A] = 1 + [1/n + 1/(n A)] / [A + log A].

Again, as n approaches infinity, A = log n, so 1/n and 1/(n A) are both o(1), and the denominator A + log A is Ω(log n). Therefore, the whole expression tends to 1. So, yes, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) should tend to 1.

But wait, maybe I need to consider higher-order terms. Let me check. Let's suppose that p_{n+1}/p_n approaches 1, which is given. Let me denote r_n = p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + ε_n, where ε_n → 0 as n → ∞. Then, log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n) + log(1 + ε_n) ≈ log(p_n) + ε_n - ε_n^2/2 + ... So, log(p_{n+1}) ≈ log(p_n) + ε_n. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) ≈ 1 + ε_n / log(p_n). Since ε_n → 0 and log(p_n) → ∞, this ratio should approach 1. Therefore, even in this general case, if p_{n+1}/p_n approaches 1, then log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) would approach 1.

Wait, that seems like a more general argument. Let me formalize it. If lim_{n→∞} r_n = 1, where r_n = p_{n+1}/p_n, then log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n r_n) = log p_n + log r_n. Therefore, log(p_{n+1}) / log p_n = 1 + (log r_n) / log p_n. Since r_n → 1, log r_n ≈ r_n - 1 (using the approximation log(1 + ε) ≈ ε for small ε). Therefore, log r_n ≈ ε_n. So, (log r_n) / log p_n ≈ ε_n / log p_n. Since ε_n → 0 and log p_n → ∞, the ratio ε_n / log p_n → 0. Therefore, log(p_{n+1})/log p_n → 1 + 0 = 1. So, regardless of the specific behavior of ε_n, as long as r_n approaches 1, the logarithmic ratio should approach 1.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the limit is 1. But wait, let me verify with another approach. Let's use the Prime Number Theorem more directly. Since p_n ~ n log n, then log p_n ~ log n + log log n. Let's see:

log p_n = log(n log n) = log n + log log n = log n (1 + (log log n)/log n). Then, log(p_{n+1}) = log((n+1) log(n+1)) = log(n+1) + log log(n+1) ≈ log n + log log n + 1/n + 1/(n log n). So, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log p_n is approximately [log n + log log n + 1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n] = 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n]. As n → ∞, the denominator grows logarithmically, while the numerator of the fraction is O(1/n). Therefore, the entire fraction tends to zero. Hence, the ratio tends to 1.

Alternatively, using the approximation p_n ≈ n log n, then log p_n ≈ log n + log log n. The difference between log p_{n+1} and log p_n is approximately log(n+1) + log log(n+1) - [log n + log log n] ≈ log(1 + 1/n) + log log(1 + 1/n). Which is approximately 1/n + 1/(n log n). So, the difference is o(1), and the ratio log p_{n+1}/log p_n is 1 + o(1)/log p_n, which tends to 1.

But maybe I should consider the behavior of the primes more carefully. For example, the gaps between primes. The average gap between primes around n is approximately log n, so the gaps grow, but the ratio of consecutive primes approaches 1. However, the question is about the ratio of their logarithms. Since log p_n ~ log n, the difference in log p_{n+1} - log p_n is approximately log(n+1) - log n = log(1 + 1/n) ≈ 1/n. Therefore, the difference in logarithms is O(1/n), which is much smaller than log p_n itself, which is O(log n). Therefore, the ratio log p_{n+1}/log p_n should approach 1.

Is there any case where even if the ratio of consecutive terms approaches 1, the ratio of their logarithms doesn't approach 1? For example, suppose you have a sequence a_n where a_{n+1}/a_n approaches 1, but log a_{n+1}/log a_n does not approach 1. Let me think. For instance, take a_n = n. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = (n+1)/n → 1, and log a_{n+1}/log a_n = (log(n+1))/log n → 1. So that works. Another example: a_n = n^2. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = ((n+1)^2)/n^2 → 1, and log a_{n+1}/log a_n = 2 log(n+1)/2 log n → 1. So even if the sequence is growing polynomially, the ratio of logs still approaches 1. What about exponential growth? Suppose a_n = e^{n}. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = e^{n+1}/e^{n} = e → e ≠ 1, so that doesn't fit the given condition. Wait, but the problem states that the ratio approaches 1, so maybe sequences that grow faster than any polynomial but slower than exponential? For example, a_n = e^{sqrt(n)}. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = e^{sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n)} ≈ e^{(sqrt(n+1)-sqrt(n))} ≈ e^{(1/(2 sqrt(n)))} → 1. So in this case, log a_{n+1}/log a_n = sqrt(n+1)/sqrt(n) → 1. So even here, the ratio of logs approaches 1. So maybe in general, if the ratio of consecutive terms approaches 1, then the ratio of logarithms also approaches 1?

Wait, let's try to formalize this. Suppose that lim_{n→∞} a_{n+1}/a_n = 1. Then, we want to see if lim_{n→∞} log a_{n+1}/log a_n = 1. Let me set r_n = a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 + ε_n, with ε_n → 0. Then, log a_{n+1} = log(a_n r_n) = log a_n + log(1 + ε_n) ≈ log a_n + ε_n - ε_n^2/2 + ... So, log a_{n+1} ≈ log a_n + ε_n. Therefore, log a_{n+1}/log a_n ≈ 1 + ε_n / log a_n. If log a_n → ∞, which it does if a_n → ∞, then ε_n / log a_n → 0, so the ratio tends to 1. Therefore, this suggests that if a_n increases to infinity and the ratio of consecutive terms approaches 1, then the ratio of their logarithms also approaches 1.

But in the problem, the primes do increase to infinity, so this general argument would imply that the ratio log p_{n+1}/log p_n → 1. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But let me check if there are any subtleties here. For example, suppose a_n is a sequence where a_{n+1} = a_n + 1. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = 1 + 1/a_n → 1. Then log a_{n+1}/log a_n = log(a_n +1)/log a_n. If a_n is large, then log(a_n +1) ≈ log a_n + 1/a_n, so the ratio is ≈ 1 + 1/(a_n log a_n) → 1. So that works. Another example: a_n = n^k for some k > 0. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = ((n+1)/n)^k → 1, and log a_{n+1}/log a_n = (log(n+1))/log n + k log((n+1)/n)/log n. Wait, log a_{n+1} = k log(n+1), log a_n = k log n. So the ratio is log(n+1)/log n ≈ 1 + 1/(n log n) → 1. So again, works.

Therefore, unless there is a pathological case where a_n approaches infinity, a_{n+1}/a_n approaches 1, but log a_{n+1}/log a_n does not approach 1. Let me think if such a case exists. Suppose a_n = e^{f(n)}, where f(n) is a function such that f(n+1) - f(n) → 0, but f(n) → ∞. Then a_{n+1}/a_n = e^{f(n+1)-f(n)} → 1. Then log a_{n+1}/log a_n = f(n+1)/f(n). If f(n+1)/f(n) → 1, then yes. But suppose f(n+1) - f(n) = 1/(f(n)). Then f(n+1) = f(n) + 1/f(n). Then f(n) grows like sqrt(2n). Then f(n+1)/f(n) ≈ 1 + 1/f(n)^2 → 1. So even here, the ratio of logs tends to 1. Hmm.

Alternatively, suppose f(n+1) = f(n) + 1/(f(n) log f(n)). Then f(n) would grow slower. But even in that case, f(n+1)/f(n) → 1, and log a_{n+1}/log a_n = f(n+1)/f(n) → 1. So seems like in all reasonable cases, the ratio of logs tends to 1 if the ratio of terms tends to 1 and the terms go to infinity.

Therefore, unless there is a specific case where f(n) is not growing but oscillating, which is not possible here since primes are increasing. Therefore, I think the answer is yes, the limit is 1.

But let me double-check with the prime number theorem. The nth prime is approximately n log n. Therefore, log p_n ≈ log n + log log n. Then log p_{n+1} ≈ log(n+1) + log log(n+1). The ratio is [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)]/[log n + log log n]. Let's divide numerator and denominator by log n:

= [ (1 + 1/n) log n + log log(n+1) ] / [ log n + log log n ]  
= [ log n + (1/n) log n + log log(n+1) ] / [ log n + log log n ]  
= 1 + [ (1/n) log n + log log(n+1) - log log n ] / [ log n + log log n ]

The numerator of the second term is (1/n) log n + [log log(n+1) - log log n]. Let's analyze the second term: log log(n+1) - log log n = log(log(n+1)/log n) ≈ log(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ 1/(n log n). Therefore, the entire numerator becomes (1/n) log n + 1/(n log n). The denominator is log n + log log n. Therefore, the ratio becomes 1 + [ (1/n) log n + 1/(n log n) ] / [ log n + log log n ].

As n approaches infinity, the dominant term in the numerator of the fraction is (1/n) log n, and the denominator is log n. So the fraction becomes approximately (1/n) log n / log n = 1/n, which tends to zero. Therefore, the entire ratio tends to 1 + 0 = 1.

Therefore, even after breaking it down, the ratio log p_{n+1}/log p_n does approach 1. So the answer should be yes.

But just to be thorough, let's consider the exact behavior of primes. The Prime Number Theorem gives p_n ~ n log n, but there are more precise approximations, like p_n = n log n + n log log n + ... So, the next term is n log log n. Therefore, p_{n+1} = (n+1) log(n+1) + (n+1) log log(n+1) + ... So, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n would be approximately (1 + 1/n) [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. Which we already analyzed and saw that it tends to 1. Then, taking logarithms, as before, gives the ratio of logs tending to 1.

Alternatively, using the approximation p_n = n log n + O(n log log n), then log p_n = log n + log log n + log(1 + O(log log n / log n)) ≈ log n + log log n + O((log log n)/log n). Therefore, log p_{n+1} - log p_n ≈ log(n+1) + log log(n+1) - log n - log log n ≈ log(1 + 1/n) + log log(1 + 1/n) ≈ 1/n - 1/(2n^2) + 1/(n log n). Therefore, the difference in logs is O(1/n), which is much smaller than log p_n, which is O(log n). Therefore, the ratio log p_{n+1}/log p_n = 1 + O(1/(n log n)) → 1.

Therefore, all these different approaches lead to the conclusion that the limit is indeed 1. So I think the answer is yes, the limit is 1. Therefore, the conclusion is that if the ratio of consecutive primes approaches 1, then the ratio of their logarithms also approaches 1.

6. **General Argument**: For any sequence \\( a_n \\to \\infty \\) with \\( \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} = 1 \\), the difference \\( \\log a_{n+1} - \\log a_n \\to 0 \\).

Therefore, the conclusion is that \\( \\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{\\log(p_{n+1})}{\\log(p_n)} = 1 \\).

","Okay, let's see. The problem says that if the limit as n approaches infinity of p_{n+1}/p_n is 1, where p_k is the sequence of prime numbers, then we need to determine if the limit of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) is also 1. Alright, so the first thing I need to recall is what I know about the distribution of prime numbers and the behavior of the primes as they get large.

I remember that the Prime Number Theorem tells us that the nth prime p_n is approximately n log n for large n. So, p_n ~ n log n. That means that as n gets really big, p_n is roughly proportional to n log n. So, p_{n+1} would be roughly (n+1) log(n+1). Then, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n would be approximately (n+1) log(n+1) / (n log n). Let's simplify that. The (n+1)/n part is about 1 + 1/n, and log(n+1)/log n can be approximated using the expansion log(n+1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n - 1/(2n²) + ... So, log(n+1)/log n ≈ 1 + 1/(n log n). Therefore, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n ≈ (1 + 1/n)(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ 1 + 1/n + 1/(n log n) + 1/(n² log n). As n goes to infinity, both 1/n and 1/(n log n) go to zero, so the limit of p_{n+1}/p_n as n approaches infinity is indeed 1. That matches the given condition.

Now, the question is about the limit of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n). So, using the approximation p_n ~ n log n, log(p_n) would be log(n log n) = log n + log log n. Similarly, log(p_{n+1}) ≈ log(n+1) + log log(n+1). Then, the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) would be [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. Let's try to approximate this. Again, log(n+1) = log n + log(1 + 1/n) ≈ log n + 1/n, and log log(n+1) = log[log n + log(1 + 1/n)] ≈ log log n + (1/(n log n)) using the expansion log(a + b) ≈ log a + b/a when b is small compared to a. So, putting it all together, the numerator becomes approximately log n + 1/n + log log n + 1/(n log n), and the denominator is log n + log log n. Therefore, the ratio is [log n + log log n + 1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n]. If we factor out log n + log log n from the numerator, we get 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n]. As n approaches infinity, the denominator log n + log log n grows to infinity, while the numerator 1/n + 1/(n log n) tends to zero. Therefore, the entire expression tends to 1 + 0 = 1. So, the limit of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) should be 1 as n approaches infinity.

Wait, but let me check if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using the given condition directly. If we know that p_{n+1}/p_n approaches 1, then taking the logarithm, we have log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) = log(p_{n+1}/p_n) approaches log(1) = 0. So, the difference between log(p_{n+1}) and log(p_n) goes to zero. But does that necessarily mean that the ratio log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) approaches 1? Let's think. If the difference between two quantities goes to zero, does their ratio go to 1? Not necessarily. For example, suppose a_n = n and b_n = n + 1. Then, a_n - b_n = -1, which doesn't go to zero, but if we take a_n = n and b_n = n + 1/n, then the difference is 1/n, which goes to zero, but the ratio a_n/b_n = 1/(1 + 1/n²) approaches 1. Hmm, maybe in some cases. Wait, but in the case where the difference goes to zero but the terms themselves go to infinity, the ratio might approach 1. Let's formalize this.

Suppose we have two sequences a_n and b_n such that a_n - b_n → 0 and a_n → ∞, b_n → ∞. Then, does a_n/b_n → 1? Let's see. If a_n = b_n + c_n where c_n → 0, then a_n/b_n = 1 + c_n/b_n. If c_n/b_n → 0, then a_n/b_n → 1. But if c_n/b_n doesn't go to zero, then it might not. For example, let’s say a_n = b_n + 1. Then, a_n/b_n = 1 + 1/b_n. If b_n → ∞, then 1/b_n → 0, so a_n/b_n → 1. But if, say, a_n = b_n + sqrt(b_n), then a_n/b_n = 1 + 1/sqrt(b_n) → 1. Wait, but in our case, log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) = log(p_{n+1}/p_n) → 0, but log(p_n) itself tends to infinity because p_n ~ n log n, so log(p_n) ~ log n + log log n, which does go to infinity. Therefore, log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) = o(1), and log(p_{n}) → ∞. Therefore, log(p_{n+1}) - log(p_n) = o(1), so log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n) + o(1). Then, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) = [log(p_n) + o(1)] / log(p_n) = 1 + o(1)/log(p_n). Since o(1) is something that goes to zero, o(1)/log(p_n) would be negligible because log(p_n) goes to infinity. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1. So, even in this more general case, if the difference between the two logarithms goes to zero and the logarithms themselves go to infinity, then the ratio of the logarithms tends to 1.

Therefore, combining both approaches, whether using the prime number theorem approximation or using the general sequence argument, the conclusion is that the limit of log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) is indeed 1. Therefore, the answer should be yes, the limit is 1.

But wait, let me check if there's any possibility that even though the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n tends to 1, the logarithms could behave differently. For example, suppose p_n is a sequence where p_{n+1} = p_n + 1. Then, the ratio p_{n+1}/p_n = 1 + 1/p_n, which tends to 1 as p_n increases. Then, log(p_{n+1}) = log(p_n + 1) ≈ log p_n + 1/p_n. Then, log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) ≈ 1 + 1/(p_n log p_n). If p_n increases, this term goes to zero, so the ratio tends to 1. So even in such a case, the ratio of the logarithms tends to 1. So, in general, if the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n tends to 1, and a_n tends to infinity, then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) tends to 1. Because log(a_{n+1}) = log(a_n) + log(1 + (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n) ≈ log(a_n) + (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n. Then, log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) = 1 + (a_{n+1} - a_n)/(a_n log a_n). If (a_{n+1} - a_n)/a_n → 0, then this term goes to zero since a_n log a_n tends to infinity. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1. Therefore, regardless of the specific sequence, as long as the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n →1 and a_n → ∞, then log(a_{n+1})/log(a_n) →1. Therefore, applying this to primes, since p_n → ∞ and p_{n+1}/p_n →1, the conclusion is that log(p_{n+1})/log(p_n) →1.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the limit is 1. But let me check if there's any possible counterexample. Suppose we have a sequence where the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n →1, but the logarithms don't have their ratio →1. But according to the above reasoning, it's impossible. Because if a_{n+1} = a_n * (1 + b_n), where b_n →0, then log(a_{n+1}) = log a_n + log(1 + b_n) ≈ log a_n + b_n - b_n²/2 + ..., so log(a_{n+1})/log a_n ≈ (1 + b_n - b_n²/2 + ...)/1 ≈1 + b_n. But if b_n →0, then unless b_n is of the order 1/log a_n, the ratio would still tend to 1. Wait, but if b_n is of the order 1/a_n, then even if a_n → ∞, the term b_n = o(1), so log(a_{n+1})/log a_n =1 + o(1)/log a_n →1. Therefore, regardless, the ratio tends to 1. Because even if b_n is something like 1/sqrt(a_n), then b_n →0, and log(a_{n+1})/log a_n =1 + (1/sqrt(a_n))/log a_n →1. Therefore, in all cases, as long as the ratio a_{n+1}/a_n →1 and a_n → ∞, the ratio of the logarithms tends to 1. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But just to be thorough, let me consider the prime numbers specifically. Since p_n ~ n log n, then log p_n ~ log n + log log n. Therefore, log p_{n+1} ~ log(n+1) + log log(n+1) ≈ log n + log(1 + 1/n) + log log n + log(1 + 1/(n log n)) ≈ log n + 1/n - 1/(2n²) + log log n + 1/(n log n). Then, the ratio log p_{n+1}/log p_n ≈ [log n + log log n + 1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n] = 1 + [1/n + 1/(n log n)] / [log n + log log n]. As n → ∞, the numerator [1/n + 1/(n log n)] is o(1), and the denominator [log n + log log n] is Ω(log n), so the entire fraction is o(1)/Ω(log n) →0. Therefore, the ratio tends to 1. Therefore, the conclusion is correct.

Alternatively, using the approximation that p_n ≈ n log n, then log p_n ≈ log n + log log n. Let's consider log p_{n+1} = log(n+1 log(n+1)) = log(n+1) + log log(n+1). Then, log p_{n+1}/log p_n = [log(n+1) + log log(n+1)] / [log n + log log n]. Let's split this into two parts: [log(n+1)/log n] * [1 + (log log(n+1))/log(n+1)] / [1 + (log log n)/log n]. The first term is (log(n+1)/log n) ≈1 + 1/(n log n). The second term is [1 + (log log(n+1))/(log(n+1))] / [1 + (log log n)/log n] ≈ [1 + (1/(n log n)) / (1 + 1/n)] / [1 + (1/(n log n))]. Wait, maybe this is getting too complicated, but essentially, each part is approaching 1, and the overall ratio is 1. So, through multiple approaches—using prime number theorem approximations, general sequence arguments, and analyzing the logarithmic expansions—it seems that the ratio of the logarithms must approach 1.

Therefore, the answer is that yes, the limit is 1.

To compute the Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy = 1\\}\\), we recognize that \\(A\\) is the hyperbola \\(xy = 1\\). This hyperbola consists of two smooth curves (one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant), each of which is a one-dimensional manifold embedded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\).

The Lebesgue measure in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) is a two-dimensional measure (area). For a set to have positive Lebesgue measure, it must occupy a two-dimensional region. However, the hyperbola \\(xy = 1\\) is a one-dimensional curve, meaning it does not enclose any area. 

To rigorously confirm this, we can use Fubini's theorem. For each \\(x \\neq 0\\), the set \\(A\\) intersects the vertical line at \\(x\\) in a single point \\((x, 1/x)\\). Each single point has Lebesgue measure zero in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). By Fubini's theorem, the measure of \\(A\\) is the integral over all \\(x\\) of the measure of these cross-sections, which are all zero. Hence, the integral (and thus the measure of \\(A\\)) is zero.

Additionally, any smooth curve in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) can be covered by countably many rectangles with arbitrarily small total area, confirming that its Lebesgue measure is zero. Since the hyperbola is a smooth one-dimensional manifold, it indeed has Lebesgue measure zero.

Thus, the Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, let's see. I need to compute the Lebesgue measure of the set A, which is defined as all points (x, y) in R² such that xy = 1. Hmm, so first, I should visualize this set. The equation xy = 1 is a hyperbola, right? It has two branches, one in the first quadrant where both x and y are positive, and another in the third quadrant where both are negative. So, A is the hyperbola itself, not the area between the branches or anything like that. 

Now, the Lebesgue measure in R² is essentially the area. So, I need to find the area of the hyperbola. Wait, but intuitively, the hyperbola is just a curve, not a filled-in region. In measure theory, the Lebesgue measure of a curve is zero because it's a one-dimensional set in a two-dimensional space. But maybe I should verify this more carefully.

Let me recall: in R², the Lebesgue measure is the standard area measure. Any set with zero area has measure zero. A curve, like a hyperbola, is a one-dimensional object. Since it doesn't have any area, just length, its Lebesgue measure should be zero. But let me check if there's a way to confirm this.

Another approach: maybe parameterize the hyperbola and compute its length. The length of the hyperbola in R² would be an integral over the parameter, but that's different from the Lebesgue measure. Wait, no. The Lebesgue measure of a set is the area, not the length. So even if I compute its length, that's a one-dimensional measure. The area should still be zero because it's a one-dimensional subset of the plane.

Alternatively, could there be a mistake here? For example, sometimes people confuse between the area of a region and the measure of a boundary. But in this case, the hyperbola is the boundary between regions where xy > 1 and xy < 1, but the hyperbola itself is a curve. So, its measure should be zero.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe using integration. Suppose I try to compute the area of A. Since A is the set where xy = 1, which is a one-dimensional curve, not a two-dimensional region. So, in Lebesgue measure, sets of dimension less than 2 (like curves) have measure zero. Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of A is zero.

Is there any way the hyperbola could have a positive measure? For instance, if it were a union of lines or something, but no. The hyperbola is a smooth curve, not a line. Lines in R² have Lebesgue measure zero, and so do curves. The only way a set in R² has positive measure is if it has a two-dimensional structure, like a filled area or a region. Since A is just a curve, measure zero.

Alternatively, maybe using Fubini's theorem. Let's consider integrating over x and y. For each x ≠ 0, the equation xy = 1 gives y = 1/x. So, for each x ≠ 0, the set A intersects the vertical line x = constant at a single point y = 1/x. Similarly, for each y ≠ 0, the intersection with horizontal lines is a single point. Therefore, in both x and y slices, the set A is just a single point, which has measure zero in R. By Fubini's theorem, the measure of A would be the integral over x of the measure of the cross-sections, which are all zero. Hence, the total measure is zero.

Another angle: the hyperbola can be considered as a one-dimensional manifold embedded in R². The Lebesgue measure in R² is the two-dimensional measure, so such a one-dimensional manifold would have measure zero. This is similar to how a line in the plane has area zero.

Wait, maybe even more formally: any smooth curve in R² can be covered by countably many rectangles with total area as small as desired. Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of the hyperbola is zero. Since the hyperbola is a smooth curve, it's rectifiable, but its area is still zero.

Alternatively, think about the hyperbola in polar coordinates. Let's parametrize it. If I set x = r cosθ, y = r sinθ, then xy = r² cosθ sinθ = (r²/2) sin(2θ) = 1. So, r² = 2 / sin(2θ). This parametrization is valid except when sin(2θ) is zero (i.e., θ = 0, π/2, etc.), which are points where the hyperbola isn't defined. But even so, in polar coordinates, the hyperbola is still a one-dimensional set. The area element in polar coordinates is r dr dθ, but integrating over the hyperbola would involve integrating r dr dθ along the curve, but that's again a one-dimensional integral, not an area.

Alternatively, maybe approximate the hyperbola with line segments. The Lebesgue measure of a set is the infimum of the areas of open sets covering the set. Since the hyperbola is a curve, we can cover it with small rectangles whose total area can be made arbitrarily small, hence the measure is zero.

Therefore, after considering multiple approaches—visualization, Fubini's theorem, parametrization, and the definition of Lebesgue measure—it seems consistent that the Lebesgue measure of the set A is zero.

**Final Answer**
The Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, so I need to compute the Lebesgue measure of the set A, which is defined as all points (x, y) in the real plane where the product of x and y equals 1. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this set looks like geometrically. The equation xy = 1 is a hyperbola, right? It has two branches: one in the first quadrant where both x and y are positive, and the other in the third quadrant where both x and y are negative. 

Lebesgue measure in the plane, or 2-dimensional Lebesgue measure, is essentially the area of a set. So, if I'm asked for the measure of this hyperbola, I need to figure out how much ""area"" it takes up. But wait, hyperbolas are curves, not regions. In calculus, when we compute the area under a curve, we consider the area between the curve and the axes. But here, the hyperbola is a one-dimensional curve in a two-dimensional space. 

Let me recall some measure theory. The Lebesgue measure of a set in ℝ² is zero if the set is one-dimensional. For example, the graph of a continuous function on an interval has Lebesgue measure zero. Similarly, any smooth curve in the plane should have Lebesgue measure zero because it's essentially ""infinitely thin"" compared to the area. 

But let me verify this. Suppose I try to compute the measure by integrating over the region. If I consider the set A = {(x, y) | xy = 1}, it's a curve, not a region. Since Lebesgue measure in ℝ² is a 2-dimensional measure, the measure of a 1-dimensional manifold (which a hyperbola is) should be zero. 

Wait, but maybe I should check this more carefully. Let's parameterize the hyperbola. For the branch in the first quadrant, we can write y = 1/x for x > 0. Similarly, in the third quadrant, y = 1/x for x < 0. So, the hyperbola can be represented as two separate curves. Each of these is a one-dimensional curve. 

In measure theory, the Lebesgue measure of a curve in the plane is zero because it can be covered by countably many rectangles (or other shapes) with arbitrarily small total area. For example, if I take a small ε > 0, I can cover each point on the curve with a rectangle of height ε and a small width, but since the curve is one-dimensional, the total area covered by all these rectangles can be made less than ε. Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of the curve is zero. 

Alternatively, think about integrating the area. If I set up an integral to compute the area of A, but since A is a one-dimensional set, the integral should be zero. For example, if I try to compute the area by integrating over x and y, but the condition xy = 1 defines a curve, not a region. So, there's no area here. 

Let me also recall that in ℝ², the Lebesgue measure of any smooth curve (or union of smooth curves) is zero. This is a standard result in measure theory. Since the hyperbola is a smooth curve, its measure is zero. 

But wait, could there be a case where a set defined by a non-smooth equation has a different measure? For instance, the Cantor set in ℝ has measure zero, even though it's nowhere dense. Similarly, the hyperbola is a smooth curve, so its measure is zero. 

Another way to think about it: the Lebesgue measure in ℝ² is absolutely continuous with respect to the area. Since the hyperbola doesn't enclose any area, its measure must be zero. 

Alternatively, using Fubini's theorem. Let me try applying Fubini's theorem here. For each x ≠ 0, the set A intersects the vertical line x = a in a single point y = 1/a. So, for each x ≠ 0, the cross-section is a single point, which has measure zero in ℝ. Therefore, integrating over x, the measure of A should be the integral over x of the measure of the cross-sections, which is zero. Hence, by Fubini's theorem, the measure of A is zero. 

Wait, that seems right. Because Fubini's theorem allows us to compute the measure by integrating the measures of the cross-sections. Since each cross-section is a single point (measure zero), the integral is zero. 

Let me also consider parametrization. If I parameterize the hyperbola by x, then for each x ≠ 0, y = 1/x. The Lebesgue measure of the image of a parameterized curve is zero because the image is one-dimensional. 

Alternatively, consider that the hyperbola is a one-dimensional manifold embedded in ℝ². The Lebesgue measure of a 1-dimensional manifold in ℝ² is zero because it's a lower-dimensional subset. 

So, all these different approaches suggest that the Lebesgue measure of the set A is zero. 

But just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let's think if there's another perspective. Suppose someone claims that maybe the hyperbola has positive measure. But that would contradict the general principle that lower-dimensional subsets have measure zero in higher-dimensional spaces. For example, the area of a line in the plane is zero. Similarly, a curve is just a one-dimensional object in the plane, so its area (Lebesgue measure) is zero. 

Another angle: the hyperbola is a countable union of curves, right? Wait, actually, it's two separate curves. But even a single curve has measure zero. So, the union of two curves still has measure zero. 

What about if the hyperbola were part of a higher-dimensional set? For example, if we had a 2-dimensional set whose boundary is the hyperbola, but in this case, the hyperbola itself is the set we're considering. 

Alternatively, consider that the hyperbola is a solution set to the equation xy - 1 = 0. The zero set of a smooth function has measure zero. This is a standard result in analysis. 

Yes, so putting all these together, I can confidently say that the Lebesgue measure of the set A is zero.

**Final Answer**
The Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A\\) is \\boxed{0}.

To compute the Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy = 1\\}\\), we recognize that \\(A\\) is the hyperbola \\(xy = 1\\). This hyperbola consists of two smooth curves (one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant), each of which is a one-dimensional manifold embedded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\).

The Lebesgue measure in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) is a two-dimensional measure (area). For a set to have positive Lebesgue measure, it must occupy a two-dimensional region. However, the hyperbola \\(xy = 1\\) is a one-dimensional curve, meaning it does not enclose any area. 

To rigorously confirm this, we can use Fubini's theorem. For each \\(x \\neq 0\\), the set \\(A\\) intersects the vertical line at \\(x\\) in a single point \\((x, 1/x)\\). Each single point has Lebesgue measure zero in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). By Fubini's theorem, the measure of \\(A\\) is the integral over all \\(x\\) of the measure of these cross-sections, which are all zero. Hence, the integral (and thus the measure of \\(A\\)) is zero.

Additionally, any smooth curve in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) can be covered by countably many rectangles with arbitrarily small total area, confirming that its Lebesgue measure is zero. Since the hyperbola is a smooth one-dimensional manifold, it indeed has Lebesgue measure zero.

Thus, the Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, so I need to compute the Lebesgue measure of the set A, which is defined as all points (x, y) in the real plane where the product of x and y equals 1. Hmm, let me think. 

First, I remember that the Lebesgue measure in two dimensions is essentially the area. So, if I can figure out the area of the set A, that should give me the Lebesgue measure. But wait, A is the set of points where xy = 1. That equation represents a hyperbola, right? The hyperbola xy = 1 has two branches: one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant. So, it's like two curves extending to infinity. 

But hold on, hyperbolas are curves, not areas. So, in the plane, a single curve has zero area. Because area is a two-dimensional measure, and a curve is one-dimensional. So, intuitively, the Lebesgue measure of A should be zero. But I should verify this properly.

Let me recall some measure theory. In general, in n-dimensional space, the Lebesgue measure of a set is the n-dimensional volume. So, in 2D, it's the area. If the set is a curve, which is 1-dimensional, its 2-dimensional Lebesgue measure should be zero. That makes sense. So, the hyperbola is a 1-dimensional manifold embedded in 2D space, so its area is zero.

But maybe I should approach this more formally. Let's consider the set A. For each x ≠ 0, there is a unique y = 1/x. So, the set A can be written as the union of two curves: one with x > 0 and y = 1/x, and another with x < 0 and y = 1/x. Each of these is a smooth curve. 

Since the Lebesgue measure is a complete measure, and any countable union of sets with measure zero also has measure zero. Each individual curve has measure zero, so their union would still have measure zero. Therefore, the measure of A should be zero.

Alternatively, I can think about integrating over the set A. But since A is a curve, integrating over it would be integrating along a one-dimensional manifold. However, the Lebesgue measure is a different concept. The Lebesgue measure of a curve in 2D is zero because you can cover the curve with arbitrarily small rectangles, and the total area of those rectangles can be made as small as desired. 

Wait, maybe I should use the concept of covering the set with rectangles. For any ε > 0, we can cover the hyperbola xy = 1 with a collection of rectangles such that the total area of the rectangles is less than ε. Since ε is arbitrary, the measure must be zero.

To elaborate, take each vertical strip from x = -n to x = -n+1 and x = n-1 to x = n for some large n. In each strip, the hyperbola is a smooth curve y = 1/x. The length of the curve in each strip can be approximated, but even if we cover each such curve with a rectangle of width 1 and height equal to the maximum deviation of the curve from a horizontal line in that strip. However, since the curve is continuous and differentiable, its vertical deviations can be made small over small intervals. Therefore, each rectangle can have a very small height, say h, leading to an area of 1*h. Summing over all strips, the total area would be approximately (2n)*h. By choosing h = ε/(2n), the total area becomes ε, which can be made as small as desired. Therefore, the measure is zero.

Another approach is using Fubini's theorem. Let's consider the set A as a subset of R^2. For each x, the set A_x is the set of y such that xy = 1. If x ≠ 0, then A_x is a single point y = 1/x. If x = 0, then there is no solution. Therefore, for each x, the measure of A_x is zero. Then, by Fubini's theorem, the measure of A is the integral over x of the measure of A_x, which is the integral of zero over all x. Hence, the measure is zero.

Wait, that seems straightforward. If for each x, the cross-section A_x is a single point (which has measure zero in R), then integrating that over all x in R would give zero. So, the Lebesgue measure of A is indeed zero.

But let me check again. Is there any case where a curve could have positive Lebesgue measure? For example, in some pathological cases, but in standard analysis, smooth curves are one-dimensional and have two-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero. Also, Cantor sets are uncountable but have measure zero. So, the hyperbola, being a smooth curve, definitely has measure zero.

Alternatively, if the set were a filled region, like the area between the hyperbola and some bounds, that would have positive area. But the set A is just the hyperbola itself, not any area around it. So, yeah, measure zero.

Therefore, after considering multiple approaches—intuitive understanding, covering the set with small rectangles, using Fubini's theorem—it all points to the Lebesgue measure of A being zero.

**Final Answer**
The Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, so I need to compute the Lebesgue measure of the set A, which is the set of all points (x, y) in the plane such that their product is 1. Hmm, let me start by recalling what the Lebesgue measure is. In two-dimensional space, the Lebesgue measure corresponds to the area of the set, right? So, if I can visualize the set A, maybe I can figure out its area.

The equation xy = 1 is a hyperbola. I remember that hyperbolas are two-dimensional curves that extend to infinity. Specifically, the hyperbola xy = 1 has two branches: one in the first quadrant where both x and y are positive, and one in the third quadrant where both x and y are negative. Since it's a hyperbola, it's a one-dimensional curve in the plane. But wait, Lebesgue measure in two dimensions is for areas. So, if A is just a curve, does it have area?

I think that in Lebesgue measure terms, a curve (a one-dimensional manifold) has measure zero in two-dimensional space. That's because the area of a line is zero. For example, the Lebesgue measure of a line segment in the plane is zero. Similarly, the hyperbola, being a curve, should have Lebesgue measure zero.

But let me double-check. Is there a way to confirm this? Maybe by considering the parametrization of the hyperbola. If I parametrize the hyperbola, say by x = t, then y = 1/t for t ≠ 0. So the hyperbola can be written as the graph of the function y = 1/x, which is a smooth curve. Since it's a smooth curve, it's a one-dimensional set in two-dimensional space, and hence should have measure zero.

Alternatively, I can think of the hyperbola as the image of a continuous function from a one-dimensional space (like the real line minus zero) to the plane. The image of a continuous function from a one-dimensional space into the plane has two-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero. That's a theorem I remember: the image of a continuous function from a lower-dimensional space into a higher-dimensional space has measure zero in the higher-dimensional space.

Wait, but is the hyperbola the image of such a function? Yes, for example, the function f: ℝ \\ {0} → ℝ² defined by f(t) = (t, 1/t) maps the real line minus zero onto the hyperbola A. Since ℝ \\ {0} is one-dimensional, and the image is a one-dimensional curve, its Lebesgue measure in ℝ² should be zero.

But let me make sure there are no subtleties here. Is there a case where a curve could have positive measure? For example, if the curve is not smooth, but the hyperbola is smooth. If the curve were a Cantor set or something similar, but the hyperbola is a smooth curve, so it's a one-dimensional manifold. In general, smooth manifolds of lower dimension in higher-dimensional spaces have measure zero.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Fubini's theorem. Let's see, if I want to compute the Lebesgue measure of A, I can think of integrating over all x and y. But since A is the set where xy = 1, for each x, y is determined as 1/x. So, for each x ≠ 0, the set A intersected with the vertical line at x is just the single point (x, 1/x). Since a single point in ℝ has Lebesgue measure zero, then by Fubini's theorem, the measure of A would be the integral over all x of the measure of these cross-sections, which is zero.

Wait, but Fubini's theorem requires that we integrate over a product space. Let me recall Fubini's theorem: if we have a function f(x, y) defined on a product space, then the integral over the product space is the integral over x of the integral over y of f(x, y). But here, we are dealing with the measure of the set A, which is the set where f(x, y) = 1. So, perhaps we can think of it as the integral over x and y of the characteristic function of A. Then, by Fubini, the integral would be the integral over x of the measure of A_x, where A_x is the set of y such that xy = 1. For each x ≠ 0, A_x is a single point, which has measure zero. For x = 0, A_x is empty, which also has measure zero. Therefore, the integral (and thus the measure of A) is zero.

Yes, that seems to confirm it. Another approach: the hyperbola is a smooth curve in the plane, which has no area. So, the Lebesgue measure, being the area, is zero. 

But just to be thorough, let me consider parametrization and coarea formula or something. The coarea formula relates the integral over a space to integrals over level sets. But perhaps that's more complicated. Alternatively, using polar coordinates. The hyperbola in polar coordinates? Let's see, xy = 1. In polar coordinates, x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ. So, (r cos θ)(r sin θ) = r² cos θ sin θ = 1. So, r² = 1/(cos θ sin θ). Then, r = ±1/√(cos θ sin θ). But this is only valid where cos θ sin θ > 0, which is in the first and third quadrants. So, in polar coordinates, the hyperbola is represented by r = 1/√(cos θ sin θ) for θ in (0, π/2) and (3π/2, 2π). But regardless, this parametrization shows that the hyperbola is a one-dimensional curve in polar coordinates as well. So, again, it's a one-dimensional object in two-dimensional space, hence measure zero.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the hyperbola can be covered by countably many rectangles with total area approaching zero. Since it's a smooth curve, for any ε > 0, we can cover the hyperbola with rectangles whose total area is less than ε. Therefore, the Lebesgue measure is zero.

Wait, but how exactly? Let me think. To cover a smooth curve with small rectangles, you can parametrize the curve and then take small intervals in the parameter, map them to the curve, and cover each segment with a rectangle. Since the curve is smooth, the width in the direction perpendicular to the curve can be controlled. However, since the curve is one-dimensional, in two dimensions, the area of each such rectangle would be approximately the length of the segment times the width (which can be made small). But integrating over the curve's length times an epsilon width would give a total area proportional to epsilon times the length of the curve. However, the curve's length is infinite, so that approach might not work directly. Wait, but in the case of a hyperbola, it's an unbounded curve. But Lebesgue measure is about the area occupied. However, even though the hyperbola is infinite in length, in the sense of Lebesgue measure, a one-dimensional curve in the plane still has measure zero regardless of its length. Because the measure is about the area, not the length. So, even if the curve is infinitely long, it doesn't occupy any area.

Therefore, all these different approaches lead to the conclusion that the Lebesgue measure of the hyperbola A is zero. 

But just to make sure, let's check some references or recall if there's a theorem that states that graphs of functions have measure zero. Yes, in general, the graph of a continuous function f: ℝ → ℝ is a one-dimensional curve in ℝ², and thus has Lebesgue measure zero. Since the hyperbola is the graph of y = 1/x (except at x = 0), it's a graph of a continuous function on its domain, so its Lebesgue measure should be zero.

Therefore, after considering multiple methods and confirming through different approaches—parametrization, Fubini's theorem, polar coordinates, and the general idea that one-dimensional curves have measure zero—the conclusion is consistent: the Lebesgue measure of set A is zero.

**Final Answer**
The Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, let's see. I need to compute the Lebesgue measure of the set A, which is all points (x, y) in the plane such that xy = 1. Hmm. So, the Lebesgue measure is a way to assign a ""volume"" to subsets of Euclidean space. In two dimensions, it's the area. But wait, A is the set where xy = 1. That's a hyperbola, right? The hyperbola has two branches, one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant. But does this hyperbola have any area? Intuitively, a curve in the plane should have zero area, right? Because it's just a line, not a filled region.

But let me make sure I'm not missing something. Lebesgue measure is a generalization of length, area, and volume. For curves, which are one-dimensional objects in two-dimensional space, their Lebesgue measure should be zero. Because the Lebesgue measure in two dimensions is about area, and a curve doesn't occupy any area. Similarly, in three dimensions, a surface would have Lebesgue measure zero in the space. So, in general, lower-dimensional objects embedded in higher-dimensional spaces have zero Lebesgue measure.

But maybe I should verify this more carefully. Let me recall the definition of Lebesgue measure. The Lebesgue measure in R^n is the one that assigns to each set its ""volume"". For a set to have positive Lebesgue measure in R^2, it needs to have some area. The hyperbola is a one-dimensional manifold embedded in R^2. In measure theory, the Lebesgue measure of a set with dimension less than the ambient space is zero. So, since the hyperbola is one-dimensional in two-dimensional space, its Lebesgue measure should be zero.

But maybe I should approach this more formally. Let's try to parametrize the hyperbola. The equation xy = 1 can be written as y = 1/x. So, in the first quadrant, x > 0, y > 0, and in the third quadrant, x < 0, y < 0. So, the hyperbola consists of two curves: y = 1/x for x > 0 and y = 1/x for x < 0. Each of these is a smooth curve.

Now, in Lebesgue measure theory, the measure of a smooth curve in R^2 is zero. Because to compute the Lebesgue measure, we can approximate the set with rectangles, and the total area can be made arbitrarily small. Alternatively, using Fubini's theorem, maybe?

Wait, Fubini's theorem relates the integral over the product space to the iterated integrals. But here, we are dealing with measure, which is similar to integrating the characteristic function. Let me think. If we have a set A in R^2, then the Lebesgue measure of A is the double integral over R^2 of the characteristic function of A. But for a curve, which is one-dimensional, the integral over the area would be zero. Because integrating over a one-dimensional set in two dimensions gives zero.

Alternatively, another approach: if we can cover the hyperbola with a countable collection of rectangles with arbitrarily small total area, then its measure is zero. For any ε > 0, we can cover the hyperbola with rectangles whose total area is less than ε. For example, take a grid of rectangles around the hyperbola and make the grid fine enough. Since the hyperbola is a continuous curve, it's possible to cover it with such rectangles. Therefore, the measure is zero.

But let me check if there's a more rigorous way. Let's parametrize the hyperbola. For x ≠ 0, y = 1/x. So, we can write the set A as the union of two graphs: y = 1/x for x > 0 and y = 1/x for x < 0. Each of these is a smooth curve. The measure of a graph of a function in R^2 is zero if the function is integrable. Wait, but here the function is 1/x, which is not integrable over R in the Lebesgue sense. Hmm, maybe that approach isn't directly applicable.

Alternatively, consider that a smooth curve in R^2 is a one-dimensional manifold. The Lebesgue measure in R^2 is two-dimensional, so the measure of any one-dimensional manifold is zero. This is a standard result in measure theory. For example, the measure of a line in the plane is zero, the measure of a circle is zero, etc. So, the hyperbola, being a one-dimensional manifold, should have measure zero.

But perhaps I should also recall that the Lebesgue measure is invariant under rotations and translations. But the hyperbola is not invariant under those, so maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, think about the parametrization. If we parametrize the hyperbola as a function of x, then for each x, y is determined. But integrating over y for each x would only give a single point, which has measure zero in the y direction. So, integrating over x, the measure would be the integral of zero, which is zero.

Wait, let me try to formalize this. Let's fix x in R \\ {0}, then for each x, the set A_x = {y : xy = 1} is just the single point y = 1/x. The Lebesgue measure of a single point in R is zero. Then, by Fubini's theorem, the Lebesgue measure of A is the integral over x of the measure of A_x. That is, ∫_{R} (measure of {1/x}) dx = ∫_{R} 0 dx = 0. Therefore, the total measure is zero. That seems to confirm it.

Alternatively, integrating in the other order. For each y ≠ 0, A_y = {x : xy = 1} is the single point x = 1/y. The measure of each A_y is zero, so integrating over y gives zero again.

So, using Fubini's theorem here is a good approach. Since the set is a graph over the x-axis (except at x=0), and each vertical slice (for x ≠ 0) is a single point, which has measure zero. Therefore, integrating over x gives zero.

Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of A is zero.

But let me check if there is any possibility that the hyperbola could have positive measure. For example, if the set were not a smooth curve but had some higher dimensionality. But the hyperbola is definitely one-dimensional. For example, in polar coordinates, the hyperbola can be represented, but it's still a one-dimensional curve. So, the measure should be zero.

Another way to see it: if the set had positive measure, then it would contain a rectangle of positive area. But the hyperbola is a curve, so it cannot contain any rectangle. Hence, it must have measure zero.

Alternatively, using the concept of Hausdorff measure. The Lebesgue measure in R^2 corresponds to the 2-dimensional Hausdorff measure. The 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the hyperbola would be its length, but the 2-dimensional Hausdorff measure is zero. So, in terms of Lebesgue measure, which is the 2-dimensional Hausdorff measure, the hyperbola has measure zero.

Therefore, all these approaches lead to the conclusion that the Lebesgue measure of A is zero. So, the answer should be 0.

**Final Answer**
The Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A\\) is \\boxed{0}.

Each single point has Lebesgue measure zero in \\(\\mathbb{R}\\). By Fubini's theorem, the measure of \\(A\\) is the integral over all \\(x\\) of the measure of these cross-sections, which are all zero. Hence, the integral (and thus the measure of \\(A\\)) is zero.

Additionally, any smooth curve in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) can be covered by countably many rectangles with arbitrarily small total area, confirming that its Lebesgue measure is zero. Since the hyperbola is a smooth one-dimensional manifold, it indeed has Lebesgue measure zero.

Thus, the Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A\\) is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, so I need to compute the Lebesgue measure of the set A, which is defined as all points (x, y) in the plane where xy equals 1. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that the Lebesgue measure in R² is essentially the area measure, right? So, the question is asking for the area of the set where the product of x and y is 1. But wait, if I think about the equation xy = 1, that's a hyperbola. Right, the hyperbola is the graph of the function y = 1/x. So, in the xy-plane, this is the set of points where y is the reciprocal of x.

Now, hyperbolas are curves, and in two-dimensional space, the Lebesgue measure of a curve is zero. Because a curve is one-dimensional, and the Lebesgue measure in two dimensions is about area. So, if I have a one-dimensional object embedded in two dimensions, its area should be zero. But maybe I should verify this more carefully.

Let me recall that Lebesgue measure in R² is the standard area, so any set that can be covered by a countable collection of rectangles with total area approaching zero will have measure zero. Since a hyperbola can be approximated by such a cover, its measure should be zero. But wait, is the hyperbola actually one-dimensional? Yes, it's a smooth curve, so it's a one-dimensional manifold embedded in R². Therefore, it should have Lebesgue measure zero.

But let me check if there are any exceptions. For example, the Cantor set has Lebesgue measure zero even though it's uncountable. Similarly, any smooth curve in R², like the hyperbola, should have measure zero. So, even though the hyperbola is infinite in length, its area is zero. Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of A should be zero.

Wait, but maybe I need to approach this more formally. Let me try to parametrize the hyperbola. For the hyperbola xy = 1, we can write y = 1/x. So, for each x ≠ 0, there's a corresponding y. If I consider the parametrization (t, 1/t) where t ∈ R \\ {0}, then the hyperbola is a one-dimensional curve. The Lebesgue measure in R² of such a curve is indeed zero. Because the curve can be covered by a countable union of small intervals (in R², these would be rectangles), and each interval has area approaching zero. Therefore, the total area is zero.

Alternatively, using Fubini's theorem. If I integrate over R², the measure of A can be computed by considering for each x, the measure of y such that xy = 1. For each fixed x ≠ 0, there's exactly one y = 1/x. So, for each x, the set {y | xy =1} is a single point, which has Lebesgue measure zero in R. Therefore, by Fubini's theorem, the measure of A is the integral over x of zero, which is zero. Therefore, the Lebesgue measure of A is zero.

Wait, but maybe I need to be careful here. Let me write that down. Let A = {(x, y) ∈ R² | xy =1}. To compute the Lebesgue measure m(A), we can use Fubini's theorem. For each x ∈ R, the set A_x = { y ∈ R | xy =1 }. If x ≠ 0, then A_x is a single point {1/x}, which has measure zero. If x = 0, then the equation 0*y =1 has no solutions, so A_0 is empty. Therefore, m(A) = ∫_{R} m(A_x) dx = ∫_{R} 0 dx = 0. Therefore, the measure is zero.

Yes, that seems correct. So, using Fubini's theorem, we can conclude that the Lebesgue measure of A is zero. Another way to think about it is that the hyperbola is a one-dimensional set in two-dimensional space, hence it's a null set with respect to the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure.

Alternatively, I can recall that any smooth curve in R² has Lebesgue measure zero. Since the hyperbola is a smooth curve (except at x=0, but even there, the two branches are smooth), it should have measure zero. So, all these different approaches lead to the conclusion that the Lebesgue measure of A is zero.

But let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, sometimes people confuse the Lebesgue measure with the Hausdorff measure. The one-dimensional Hausdorff measure of the hyperbola would be its length, which is infinite, but the two-dimensional Lebesgue measure is zero. Since the question specifically asks for the Lebesgue measure, which is the standard area measure, so it's definitely zero.

Therefore, after considering multiple approaches—parametrization, Fubini's theorem, and the general property of smooth curves in higher dimensions—I can confidently say that the Lebesgue measure of A is zero.

**Final Answer**
The Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A\\) is \\boxed{0}.

To compute the Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{R}^2 : xy = 1\\}\\), we recognize that \\(A\\) is the hyperbola \\(xy = 1\\). This hyperbola consists of two smooth curves (one in the first quadrant and one in the third quadrant), each of which is a one-dimensional manifold embedded in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\).

The Lebesgue measure in \\(\\mathbb{R}^2\\) is a two-dimensional measure (area). For a set to have positive Lebesgue measure, it must occupy a two-dimensional region. However, the hyperbola \\(xy = 1\\) is a one-dimensional curve, meaning it does not enclose any area.

","Okay, so I need to compute the Lebesgue measure of the set A, which is the set of all points (x, y) in R² such that xy equals 1. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that the Lebesgue measure in R² is essentially the area of the set. So, if I can figure out the area of this set A, that should give me the Lebesgue measure.

But wait, the set A is defined by the equation xy = 1. That equation represents a hyperbola in the plane, right? Because if you rearrange it, you get y = 1/x. So, this hyperbola has two branches: one in the first quadrant where both x and y are positive, and another in the third quadrant where both x and y are negative. Now, hyperbolas are curves, not areas, so their Lebesgue measure should be zero because a curve has no area. But let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here.

Let me recall some basics about Lebesgue measure. In R², the Lebesgue measure is a way to assign a ""volume"" (which is area in two dimensions) to subsets of the plane. For a set to have positive Lebesgue measure, it needs to occupy some area. However, curves, like straight lines or hyperbolas, are one-dimensional objects in a two-dimensional space. Therefore, they should have Lebesgue measure zero because they don't cover any area. 

But maybe I should verify this more carefully. Suppose I try to compute the area of A directly. The set A is the graph of the function y = 1/x. The area under a curve is typically calculated using integration, but here, the curve itself is the boundary between regions. However, in the case of a hyperbola, it's not bounded, so integrating over all x would give an infinite area. But wait, the Lebesgue measure of the set A is not the area between the hyperbola and any axis; it's the area of the hyperbola itself, which is just the curve. Since the curve has no thickness, its area is zero.

Alternatively, I can think about the definition of Lebesgue measure. The Lebesgue measure of a set is the infimum of the sum of the areas of rectangles that cover the set. For a curve like the hyperbola, no matter how small the rectangles we choose to cover it, the total area can be made arbitrarily small. Therefore, the infimum would be zero. Hence, the Lebesgue measure of A is zero.

Wait, but let me check another angle. If I parametrize the hyperbola, say, let x = t, then y = 1/t. The parametric equations are x(t) = t, y(t) = 1/t for t ≠ 0. The length of the curve can be calculated, but the problem is about area, not length. The length of the hyperbola is infinite because it extends to infinity, but again, the area of the hyperbola itself (as a one-dimensional curve) is still zero. 

Another approach: in R², any countable union of curves (one-dimensional) has Lebesgue measure zero. Since the hyperbola is a single smooth curve (in this case, two branches), it's a countable union of smooth curves, each of which has measure zero. Therefore, the total measure is zero.

But hold on, maybe I should recall that in Lebesgue measure theory, a set has measure zero if, for every ε > 0, there exists a countable collection of rectangles covering the set whose total area is less than ε. For the hyperbola, given any ε, we can cover the hyperbola with a countable number of small rectangles such that the sum of their areas is less than ε. For example, near each point (t, 1/t), we can place a small rectangle with sides aligned along the axes, with width δ and height 1/t * δ (or something like that, depending on t). Since the hyperbola gets very steep near t = 0 and t = infinity, the heights of these rectangles would vary, but since the hyperbola is a smooth curve, we can use the fact that it's locally a graph of a function and apply the standard covering argument. Thus, the total area can be made arbitrarily small, leading to the measure being zero.

Alternatively, perhaps using Fubini's theorem. Let's consider integrating over x and y. The set A is the set of points where y = 1/x. So, in terms of Lebesgue measure in R², we can write the measure as the double integral over A of 1 dx dy. But by Fubini's theorem, this would be the integral over x of (measure of {y | y = 1/x}) dx. However, for each x ≠ 0, the set {y | y = 1/x} is a single point, which has Lebesgue measure zero. Therefore, the integral becomes the integral over all x of 0 dx, which is zero. Hence, the Lebesgue measure of A is zero.

Wait, but Fubini's theorem requires the function to be integrable. Here, the function is 1 on A and 0 elsewhere. Since A has measure zero, the integral over A of 1 dx dy is zero, which matches our conclusion.

Another way to see this is by considering that the hyperbola is a smooth curve of dimension 1 in R². The Lebesgue measure of a smooth submanifold of lower dimension is zero. Since a hyperbola is a smooth curve (a one-dimensional submanifold), its Lebesgue measure in R² is zero.

So, all these different approaches lead to the same conclusion: the Lebesgue measure of A is zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero. But let me just verify once more with a concrete example. Take the standard hyperbola y = 1/x. If we try to compute its area, it's infinite because it extends to infinity. But again, the area of the curve itself is not the area between the curve and the axes; it's the area of the curve. Since a curve has no thickness, its area is zero. 

Alternatively, imagine trying to fill the hyperbola with rectangles. Each rectangle has some area, but since the hyperbola is a curve, you can cover it with rectangles of arbitrarily small area. Hence, the infimum of the total area is zero. Therefore, the Lebesgue measure is zero.

I think that's solid. All these methods confirm the same result. So, the Lebesgue measure of A is zero.

**Final Answer**
The Lebesgue measure of the set \\(A\\) is \\boxed{0}.

To calculate the length of the tangent vector \\( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\) at the north pole \\( N \\) of the sphere \\( \\mathbb{S}^2 \\) with radius \\( r \\), we use the given metric:
\\[ g = r^2 \\, d\\varphi \\otimes d\\varphi + r^2 \\sin^2 \\varphi \\, d\\theta \\otimes d\\theta. \\]

1. **Metric Components**: The metric tensor components are:
   - \\( g_{\\varphi \\varphi} = r^2 \\)
   - \\( g_{\\theta \\theta} = r^2 \\sin^2 \\varphi \\)
   - The off-diagonal components \\( g_{\\varphi \\theta} \\) and \\( g_{\\theta \\varphi} \\) are zero.

2. **Length Calculation**: The length of the tangent vector \\( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\) is given by the square root of the inner product of the vector with itself:
   \\[
   \\left\\| \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\right\\| = \\sqrt{g\\left( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta}, \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\right)} = \\sqrt{g_{\\theta \\theta}} = \\sqrt{r^2 \\sin^2 \\varphi} = r \\sin \\varphi.

","Okay, so I need to calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole N of the sphere S² with radius r, using the given metric. The metric is g = r² dφ ⊗ dφ + r² sin²φ dθ ⊗ dθ. And I need to verify if this length is zero at the north pole where φ = 0. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, I remember that the length of a tangent vector in a Riemannian manifold is calculated using the metric tensor. The formula for the length of a vector v is the square root of g(v, v). In this case, the vector in question is ∂/∂θ. So, I need to compute g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ) and then take the square root of that.

Looking at the given metric, it's expressed in terms of φ and θ. The metric components are g_φφ = r², g_θθ = r² sin²φ, and the off-diagonal terms g_φθ and g_θφ are zero since there's no cross term. That simplifies things because the inner product of ∂/∂θ with itself will just be g_θθ.

So, g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ) = g_θθ = r² sin²φ. Therefore, the length should be sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r |sinφ|. But wait, at the north pole, φ = 0. Let me plug that in: r |sin 0| = r * 0 = 0. So, the length is zero at the north pole. That seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything.

Wait, hold on. The coordinates φ and θ here are the standard spherical coordinates, right? φ is the polar angle from the north pole, going down to the south pole, and θ is the azimuthal angle around the sphere. So, at the north pole, φ = 0, and θ can be anything, but the point is still the same. The tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole would correspond to moving around the sphere at that point. But in the standard spherical coordinates, the tangent vectors at the north pole... Hmm, isn't the θ coordinate undefined at the north pole because the latitude lines (φ = constant) collapse to a point there?

Wait, maybe there's an issue here with the coordinates. In spherical coordinates, when φ = 0, the coordinate θ becomes a singular point since all the θ circles collapse to the north pole. So, technically, the coordinate chart doesn't cover the north pole because θ becomes a bad coordinate there. So, perhaps the tangent vector ∂/∂θ is not well-defined at the north pole in this coordinate system.

But the problem statement still asks to calculate the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole. Maybe they expect the answer based on the given metric, even though the coordinate system is singular there. Let me see. If I proceed formally, using the given metric, then yes, at φ = 0, the length is zero. But is there a different way to interpret this?

Alternatively, perhaps the metric is written in terms of φ and θ, but near the north pole, the θ direction becomes compressed. So, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ would have a length that's proportional to sinφ, which goes to zero as φ approaches zero. So, in that case, the length does go to zero at the north pole. That seems to align with the calculation.

But wait, another thought: maybe the problem is trying to trick me? Because in reality, the tangent space at the north pole should have two basis vectors, typically denoted ∂/∂θ and ∂/∂φ, but in the standard spherical coordinates, when φ = 0, the ∂/∂φ direction is well-defined (pointing towards the south pole), but ∂/∂θ becomes undefined because it's along the θ circles which shrink to a point. So, perhaps in this coordinate system, ∂/∂θ is not a valid tangent vector at the north pole.

But the problem is still asking to compute the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole. Maybe they want us to proceed formally, even though the coordinate system is singular there. Let's see. If we take the given metric, compute the length as sqrt(g_θθ) = r sinφ, then at φ = 0, that's zero. So, the answer is zero. But I need to verify if that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using a different parametrization where the metric is given in terms of φ and θ, but φ is measured from the north pole. So, φ = 0 is the north pole, φ = π/2 is the equator, and φ = π is the south pole. Then, the θ direction is the azimuthal angle. So, in this case, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ is moving around the sphere at latitude φ. The length of this vector is r sinφ, which indeed goes to zero as φ approaches 0. So, at the north pole, the length is zero.

But let me think again about the coordinate system. In standard spherical coordinates, φ is the colatitude (from north pole), and θ is the longitude. So, at the north pole, all longitudes meet, so θ is not a good coordinate there. Therefore, the vector field ∂/∂θ is not actually defined at the north pole in this coordinate chart. However, if we proceed formally with the given metric, then the length is zero. So, perhaps the answer is zero, but we have to note that the coordinate system is singular at the north pole, making the vector field ∂/∂θ undefined there.

But the problem statement says ""calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole N of the sphere S² with radius r, given the metric"", so maybe they expect the answer based on the metric, even though the coordinate system is singular. So, even though ∂/∂θ isn't a valid tangent vector field at the north pole in this coordinate system, we can compute the length formally as zero.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different coordinate system where ∂/∂θ is defined at the north pole. For example, using a different coordinate chart that covers the north pole. For instance, using stereographic projection or something else. But in the given metric, the coordinates are φ and θ, so unless specified otherwise, we have to work within that.

Therefore, the length is zero at the north pole, as per the calculation using the given metric. So, the answer is zero.

Wait, but let me confirm once more. The metric is given by g = r² dφ² + r² sin²φ dθ². So, the components are g_φφ = r², g_θθ = r² sin²φ, and the rest zero. Then, the length of ∂/∂θ is sqrt(g_θθ) = r sinφ. At φ = 0, this is zero. So, yes, the length is zero at the north pole. Therefore, the answer should be zero.

But the problem says ""Verify if the length is zero at the north pole where φ = 0."" So, according to this, it is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

But wait, maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check with another approach. Suppose we parametrize the sphere and compute the tangent vector.

Alternatively, consider that in the standard spherical coordinates, the tangent vectors at a point are given by ∂/∂φ and ∂/∂θ. However, at the north pole, φ = 0, and θ is undefined. Therefore, the coordinate chart does not include the north pole. So, in this case, the vector field ∂/∂θ is not defined at the north pole. Therefore, strictly speaking, we cannot compute the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole in this coordinate system because the vector field doesn't exist there.

But the problem is asking us to compute it. So, perhaps the problem is expecting us to compute it formally, even though in reality the vector field is not defined. Therefore, according to the given metric, the length is zero. So, the answer is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different interpretation. For example, if we consider the limit as φ approaches zero, then the length of ∂/∂θ approaches zero. So, even though the vector field is not defined at φ=0, its length tends to zero there. Therefore, the problem might be testing the understanding that even though the coordinate system is singular, the length can be computed in the limit.

But if we strictly follow the problem statement, it says ""calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole N... verify if the length is zero at the north pole where φ = 0."" So, they are asking to compute it at φ = 0, which is the north pole. But in the given metric, the coordinates are φ and θ, and at φ = 0, the θ coordinate becomes a singular point. So, the vector field ∂/∂θ is not defined there. Therefore, perhaps the answer is that the length is undefined, but according to the given metric, if we proceed formally, it's zero.

But the problem says ""verify if the length is zero at the north pole where φ = 0."" So, maybe the answer is yes, it is zero, based on the given metric. So, even though the coordinate system is singular, the metric components give g_θθ = 0 at φ = 0, so the length is zero.

But wait, let's check again. The metric is given by g = r² dφ² + r² sin²φ dθ². So, the component g_θθ is r² sin²φ. At φ = 0, that is zero. Therefore, the length of ∂/∂θ is sqrt(g_θθ) = 0. So, even though the coordinate system is singular, according to the given metric, the length is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

But maybe there's a different way to interpret the metric. For example, if φ is the polar angle measured from the north pole, then as φ increases, the circles of latitude get larger until φ = π/2 (the equator), then shrink again. So, at φ = 0, the circle of latitude is a single point, so the θ direction is collapsed. Therefore, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ would have zero length because you can't move around a point. So, that makes sense.

Therefore, the length is zero at the north pole. So, the answer is zero. Therefore, the final answer is 0, which in boxed form is \\boxed{0}.

","Okay, let's see. I need to calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole of a sphere S² with radius r. The metric given is g = r² dφ⊗dφ + r² sin²φ dθ⊗dθ. Also, I have to verify if the length is zero at the north pole where φ = 0. Hmm, alright.

First, I recall that the length of a tangent vector in a metric space is given by the square root of the inner product of the vector with itself using the metric. So, for a vector v = (v^φ, v^θ), the length squared would be g(v, v) = g_{φφ}(v^φ)^2 + 2g_{φθ}v^φv^θ + g_{θθ}(v^θ)^2. But in this metric, since it's diagonal (the off-diagonal terms are zero), the length simplifies to sqrt(g_{φφ}(v^φ)^2 + g_{θθ}(v^θ)^2).

In this case, the vector is ∂/∂θ, so its components are (0, 1). Therefore, the length squared should be g_{θθ}*(1)^2. From the metric, g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ. So, the length is sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ.

But wait, at the north pole, φ = 0. So sinφ = sin0 = 0. Therefore, the length should be r*0 = 0. Hmm, so does that mean the length is zero at the north pole? That seems a bit counterintuitive because at the north pole, the circle of latitude collapses to a point, so maybe the tangent vector there isn't well-defined or has zero length? But according to the metric, yes, the coefficient of dθ⊗dθ is r² sin²φ, which becomes zero when φ=0. So, the metric component g_{θθ} vanishes at the north pole.

But wait, the vector ∂/∂θ is a tangent vector field that's defined everywhere except maybe at the poles? Because in spherical coordinates, θ is the azimuthal angle, and φ is the polar angle. So, at φ=0, which is the north pole, the coordinate θ is not defined, or perhaps the coordinate chart breaks down there. So, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ might not be defined at φ=0, hence why the length is zero? Or is it just that the metric coefficient goes to zero, making the length zero even if the vector is defined?

I think the key here is that in the standard spherical coordinates, the coordinate θ becomes undefined at the poles because the circle of latitude collapses to a point. Therefore, the tangent vectors associated with θ are not defined at the poles. However, mathematically, using the given metric, we can compute the length of ∂/∂θ, and it does go to zero as φ approaches zero. So, even though the vector isn't defined at the pole, the limit as we approach the pole along the direction of θ would have the length approaching zero. So, the answer is that the length is zero at the north pole.

But let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the component identification. The metric is given in terms of dφ and dθ. So, in the metric tensor, g_{φφ} = r², g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ, and the rest are zero. So, for the vector ∂/∂θ, which has components (v^φ, v^θ) = (0, 1), the length squared is indeed g_{θθ}*(1)^2 = r² sin²φ. Therefore, the length is r sinφ. At φ=0, this is zero. So, yes, the length is zero.

But why is the tangent vector ∂/∂θ undefined at the north pole? Because in spherical coordinates, the coordinate lines for θ are circles of latitude, which collapse to a point at the pole. So, the tangent vector to those circles becomes undefined. But in the metric, even if we formally compute the length, it still gives zero. So, perhaps the answer is that even though the vector isn't defined, the limit of its length as we approach the pole is zero.

Alternatively, maybe we can think about the coordinate charts. Since φ is the polar angle measuring from the north pole, the coordinate φ=0 is the north pole. The coordinate θ is the azimuthal angle around the pole. So, at φ=0, the coordinate θ is not fixed, but in the limit φ→0, the circumference of the circle of latitude is 2πr sinφ, which goes to zero. Therefore, the tangent vectors around θ at φ=0 would have to be scaled by sinφ, hence their length is zero.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole is indeed zero. So, the answer is zero.

Wait, but the problem says ""calculate the length"" and ""verify if the length is zero at the north pole"". So, according to the metric, it is zero. But in reality, the tangent vectors at the north pole are only the ones in the direction of φ, right? Because θ is not defined there. So, maybe the only tangent vectors at the north pole are the radial ones? But in this case, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ isn't in the tangent space at the north pole. So, perhaps we have to be careful here.

But according to the metric, the coefficient for dθ⊗dθ is zero at φ=0, so even if we try to compute the length of the vector ∂/∂θ at φ=0, it's zero. But in reality, ∂/∂θ is not defined at φ=0. So, maybe the answer is that the length is zero, but the vector itself isn't defined there.

But the problem says ""at the north pole N"", so maybe we have to interpret this carefully. If we take the limit as φ approaches zero, then the length approaches zero. Therefore, even though the vector isn't defined at φ=0, the length tends to zero. So, the answer is zero.

Alternatively, maybe in some coordinate systems, the tangent vectors at the pole are only in the φ direction, and θ direction isn't there. So, the tangent space at the pole is one-dimensional, spanned by ∂/∂φ. Therefore, the vector ∂/∂θ isn't in the tangent space at the pole, hence its length is zero because it's not a valid tangent vector there.

In summary, based on the given metric, the length of ∂/∂θ at φ=0 is zero, and this is consistent with the fact that the tangent vectors in the θ direction collapse at the pole.

**Final Answer**
The length of the tangent vector at the north pole is \\boxed{0}.

","Okay, let me try to figure out how to calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole N of the sphere S² with radius r, given the metric g. The metric is given as g = r² dφ ⊗ dφ + r² sin²φ dθ ⊗ dθ. Hmm, so first, I need to understand the coordinates here. The sphere is parameterized using φ and θ, which I think are the polar and azimuthal angles, right? So φ is the latitude angle, going from 0 at the north pole to π at the south pole, and θ is the longitude, going from 0 to 2π. 

Wait, the north pole is where φ = 0. At that point, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ should be pointing in the direction that's circumferential around the north pole. But as we know, at the pole, all the circles of latitude collapse to a point, so maybe the length of ∂/∂θ becomes zero there? But I need to verify this using the given metric.

The metric components are g_{φφ} = r² and g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ. The off-diagonal components are zero because the metric is diagonal. So, the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ should be the square root of g_{θθ}, right? Because the norm of a vector in a coordinate basis is sqrt(g_{ii} (dx^i)^2). But here, the vector is ∂/∂θ, so its components are (0,1), assuming the order is (φ, θ). Wait, no. Wait, in the metric, the diagonal components are g_{φφ} and g_{θθ}. So the metric tensor in coordinates (φ, θ) is diag(r², r² sin²φ). Therefore, the length of ∂/∂θ should be sqrt(g_{θθ}) = sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ. 

But at the north pole, φ = 0, so sinφ = 0, so the length would be zero. That seems to match with the intuition that at the pole, the circles of latitude (which ∂/∂θ is tangent to) collapse to a point. But I should double-check this because sometimes there can be subtleties with the coordinate system. 

Wait, but the given metric is written with φ as the first coordinate, but in standard spherical coordinates on the sphere, φ is often the polar angle from the north pole, and θ is the azimuthal angle. So, yes, the metric components make sense. The circumference of a circle of latitude at angle φ is 2π r sinφ, so the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ, which is tangent to that circle, should have a length that scales with the circumference. Since the circumference is 2π r sinφ, the length of ∂/∂θ is r sinφ, which matches the metric's g_{θθ} component. Therefore, at φ=0, sinφ=0, so the length is zero. 

But let me make sure I didn't mix up the coordinates. If φ is the polar angle here, then φ=0 is the north pole, φ=π/2 is the equator, and φ=π is the south pole. The metric in these coordinates is as given. Therefore, the calculation seems straightforward. The tangent vector ∂/∂θ at any point is a vector that moves along the circle of latitude at constant φ, and its length is determined by the metric component g_{θθ}, which is r² sin²φ. Taking the square root gives the length as r sinφ. So at the north pole (φ=0), sinφ=0, hence the length is zero. 

Therefore, the answer should be zero. Let me check if there's any missing step here. The problem says to calculate the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole and verify if it's zero. According to the metric, yes, it is zero. I think that's it.

**Final Answer**
The length of the tangent vector at the north pole is \\boxed{0}.

","Okay, let's see. I need to calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole N of the sphere S² with radius r, given this metric. The metric is given as g = r² dφ⊗dφ + r² sin²φ dθ⊗dθ. Hmm, so I remember that in differential geometry, the length of a tangent vector field is calculated using the metric tensor. 

First, I should recall how the metric tensor works. The metric tensor gij is used to compute the inner product of two tangent vectors. Since we're dealing with a single tangent vector here, the length squared would be g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ), right? So I need to compute this inner product using the given metric.

Looking at the metric, it's given in terms of dφ and dθ. The metric components are gφφ = r² and gθθ = r² sin²φ. The cross terms are zero because the metric is diagonal. So, the metric matrix is diagonal with entries r² and r² sin²φ.

Now, for the vector ∂/∂θ, the components in the basis (∂/∂φ, ∂/∂θ) are (0,1). Therefore, the length squared should be g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ) = gθθ * (1)² = r² sin²φ. So the length is the square root of that, which is r sinφ. 

Wait, but the problem says to verify if the length is zero at the north pole where φ=0. At φ=0, sinφ is zero, so the length would be r*0=0. That seems straightforward. But let me double-check.

Hold on, is φ the polar angle here? In the standard spherical coordinates, φ is the polar angle (from the positive z-axis), and θ is the azimuthal angle. So yes, at the north pole, φ=0, so sinφ=0. Therefore, the length of ∂/∂θ should indeed be zero. 

But wait, intuitively, at the north pole, the circle of longitude collapses to a point, so the tangent vector ∂/∂θ, which is in the direction of the longitude lines, should indeed have zero length there. That makes sense. 

But let me make sure I didn't mix up the coordinates. The metric given is in terms of φ and θ, but sometimes different sources use different notations. If φ is the polar angle (colatitude), then yes, φ=0 is the north pole. If θ were the polar angle, then it would be different, but according to the metric, gφφ is r², which is the same for the north pole as for other points, except for gθθ which depends on sin²φ. So yes, φ is the polar angle here.

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. The length is r sinφ, which is zero when φ=0. So the answer should be zero.

But let me check if there's another way to think about this. Maybe using the definition of the tangent vector. The tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole is a vector that points in the direction of increasing θ. But at the north pole, all the directions of θ are the same point, so the vector collapses. Hence, its length should be zero. That matches the calculation.

Alternatively, maybe using the concept of the metric in polar coordinates. The metric in polar coordinates is usually r² dφ² + r² sin²φ dθ², which matches the given metric here. So the components are correct.

Another check: the length of ∂/∂θ is sqrt(gθθ) = sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ. So yes, that's consistent. Therefore, at φ=0, it's zero. 

I think that's thorough. So the length is zero at the north pole, which is φ=0. Therefore, the answer is zero.

**Final Answer**
The length of the tangent vector at the north pole is \\boxed{0}.

","Okay, so I need to calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole N of the sphere S² with radius r. The metric given is g = r² dφ⊗dφ + r² sin²φ dθ⊗dθ. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, I remember that on a sphere, the standard coordinates are usually latitude and longitude, but here it's written as φ and θ. Wait, sometimes φ is the polar angle and θ the azimuthal angle, right? So φ would be zero at the north pole and π/2 at the equator. That makes sense because the metric has sin²φ in front of dθ⊗dθ. So the length element is r² sin²φ dθ², which is similar to the usual spherical coordinates.

But the problem is about the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole. Since φ is the polar angle, when φ=0, which is the north pole, the point is the north pole. But in the metric, the coefficient of dθ⊗dθ is r² sin²φ. At φ=0, sinφ=0, so that term becomes zero. So the metric component g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ, which at φ=0 is zero. Therefore, the length of ∂/∂θ would be sqrt(g_{θθ}) = sqrt(0) = 0? Wait, but that seems counterintuitive because at the north pole, the θ direction is not defined; all the θ lines converge at the pole. So the tangent vector in the θ direction would collapse there, hence its length is zero. That makes sense.

But let me verify this more carefully. The length of a vector field in a Riemannian manifold is given by the square root of the inner product of the vector with itself. So for the vector ∂/∂θ, its length squared is g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ) which is g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ. At φ=0, this is indeed zero. Therefore, the length is zero at the north pole.

But wait, maybe I need to consider the tangent space at the north pole. The tangent space at the north pole is 2-dimensional, but in the standard coordinates, the θ direction is not a valid direction there because all θ directions meet at the pole. So in the tangent space, the basis vectors are ∂/∂φ and ∂/∂θ, but at φ=0, ∂/∂θ becomes zero. Therefore, the length of ∂/∂θ is zero at φ=0.

Alternatively, maybe I can parameterize the sphere and compute the tangent vector. Let's consider a parameterization of the sphere using φ and θ. The north pole is at φ=0. If I take a curve approaching the north pole along a constant θ direction, say θ=0, then moving in the θ direction would require changing θ, but at the pole, θ is not defined. Wait, but in coordinates, even though θ is not defined, the coordinate system still has ∂/∂θ as a basis vector. But in reality, the coordinate θ is not valid at the pole, so the tangent vector ∂/∂θ there is not a valid tangent vector. Therefore, its length being zero makes sense because it's not a valid direction at that point.

But the problem states to calculate the length and verify if it's zero. According to the metric, yes, it is zero. So the answer should be zero, and it does verify that.

Wait, but maybe there's a confusion between the coordinate vectors and the actual tangent vectors. Let me recall that in Riemannian geometry, the length of a vector field X is defined as sqrt(g(X,X)). So if X is ∂/∂θ, then g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ) = g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ. At φ=0, that's zero. So yes, the length is zero.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole is zero, which matches the verification.

**Final Answer**
The length of the tangent vector at the north pole is \\boxed{0}.

\\[ g = r^2 \\, d\\varphi \\otimes d\\varphi + r^2 \\sin^2 \\varphi \\, d\\theta \\otimes d\\theta. \\]

","Okay, so I need to calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole N of the sphere S² with radius r, using the given metric. The metric is g = r² dφ⊗dφ + r² sin²φ dθ⊗dθ. Also, I have to check if the length is zero when φ = 0, which is the north pole.

First, let me recall how to compute the norm of a tangent vector in a Riemannian manifold. The norm squared of a vector field V is given by g(V, V). So, in this case, the tangent vector is ∂/∂θ, so its length squared should be g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ).

Looking at the metric, it's written in terms of dφ and dθ. The metric components are g_{φφ} = r², g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ, and the off-diagonal terms g_{φθ} and g_{θφ} should be zero since the metric is diagonal.

Therefore, the norm squared of ∂/∂θ is just g_{θθ} evaluated at the point where we're calculating the length. So, (∂/∂θ)^2 = g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ.

Wait, but the problem says to calculate the length at the north pole, where φ = 0. If φ = 0, then sinφ = 0, so g_{θθ} becomes zero. Therefore, the norm squared would be zero, so the length is zero. But that seems counterintuitive because at the north pole, the θ direction is just a point, right? Because at the north pole, the latitude is zero, and there's no meaningful direction in θ. So, the tangent vector in the θ direction collapses there, which makes sense why its length is zero.

But let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the indices. The metric is given in terms of dφ and dθ, but sometimes the standard spherical coordinates are (θ, φ) where θ is the polar angle and φ is the azimuthal angle. But here, the metric is written as g = r² dφ⊗dφ + r² sin²φ dθ⊗dθ. That suggests that φ is the polar angle and θ is the azimuthal angle. So, at the north pole, φ = 0, and as φ increases, we go towards the equator and then to the south pole.

In that case, the coordinate θ is the angle around the north-south axis, and φ is the angle from the north pole. So, at the north pole, φ = 0, so the circles of latitude (which are circles of constant φ) have radius zero. Therefore, moving in the θ direction doesn't change anything at the north pole because you can't move around a point. Hence, the tangent vector in the θ direction has zero length there.

But let me verify using the formula. The norm squared is g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ. At φ=0, sinφ=0, so the norm squared is zero, hence the length is zero. That checks out.

But just to make sure, maybe I should consider the general case. For a sphere, the metric in spherical coordinates (φ, θ) is usually written as r² dφ² + r² sin²φ dθ². So, the components are g_{φφ}=r², g_{θθ}=r² sin²φ. Therefore, the norm of ∂/∂θ is sqrt(g_{θθ}) = r sinφ. Then, at φ=0, sinφ=0, so the norm is zero. Similarly, the norm of ∂/∂φ is r, which is constant. So, that makes sense. At the north pole, the θ direction is degenerate, while the φ direction is still valid.

Therefore, the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole is indeed zero, as required.

But just to be thorough, let's go through the calculation step by step.

Given the metric:
g = r² dφ⊗dφ + r² sin²φ dθ⊗dθ.

Expressed in matrix form, the metric tensor is:
[ g_{φφ} g_{φθ} ]
[ g_{θφ} g_{θθ} ]

But since the metric is diagonal, g_{φθ} = g_{θφ} = 0.

Therefore, the norm squared of ∂/∂θ is g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ.

Therefore, the norm is sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ.

At φ = 0 (north pole), sinφ = 0, so the norm is zero.

Therefore, the length is zero at the north pole.

This seems consistent. The tangent vector in the θ direction collapses at the north pole because there's no circumference there, so moving in θ doesn't do anything. Hence, its length, which measures the ""size"" of the tangent space in that direction, is zero.

I don't see any errors in this reasoning. The key point is recognizing that the metric component g_{θθ} depends on sinφ, which vanishes at φ=0. Therefore, the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ is indeed zero at the north pole.

**Final Answer**
The length of the tangent vector \\( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\) at the north pole is \\boxed{0}.

","Okay, so I need to calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole N of the sphere S² with radius r. The metric given is g = r² dφ⊗dφ + r² sin²φ dθ⊗dθ. Also, I need to verify if the length is zero at the north pole, which is where φ = 0. 

First, let me recall how to compute the length of a tangent vector using a metric. The length squared of a vector is given by the inner product of the vector with itself using the metric. So, if I have a tangent vector V, then |V|² = g(V, V). 

In this case, the vector in question is ∂/∂θ. So, I need to compute g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ). From the given metric, the components of g in the coordinates φ and θ are:

g_{φφ} = r²

g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ

And the off-diagonal components g_{φθ} and g_{θφ} are zero because the metric is diagonal in these coordinates.

So, the inner product g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ) would be g_{θθ}*(dθ, dθ) evaluated on the vector ∂/∂θ. Wait, actually, since ∂/∂θ is a vector, the inner product is g_{θθ}*(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ). But since the metric is diagonal, it's just g_{θθ}. Therefore, the square of the length is g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ. 

Therefore, the length |∂/∂θ| = sqrt(g_{θθ}) = sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ. 

But at the north pole, φ = 0. So sinφ = sin0 = 0. Therefore, |∂/∂θ| = r*0 = 0. So the length is zero at the north pole. That matches the requirement of verifying if the length is zero there. 

Wait, but let me double-check. Is the metric correctly given? The metric is expressed in terms of φ and θ. On the sphere, typically, the coordinates are (θ, φ), but here it's written as (φ, θ). Maybe I need to confirm the coordinate system. 

In standard spherical coordinates, θ is the azimuthal angle (longitude) and φ is the polar angle (latitude). But here, the metric is written as dφ⊗dφ and dθ⊗dθ. Maybe φ is the polar angle and θ is the azimuthal angle. So in that case, the metric components would be as given. 

Assuming that φ is the polar angle (from the north pole downwards), then at the north pole, φ = 0. The tangent vector ∂/∂θ would correspond to moving along the azimuthal direction, which is a circle around the pole. However, at the pole (φ=0), moving along θ would trace a circle of zero radius, hence the length of ∂/∂θ should indeed be zero. 

But maybe there's an issue with the coordinate system. If φ is the polar angle, then near the pole, small changes in θ would correspond to points that are close together, but their distance depends on sinφ. As φ approaches 0, sinφ approaches 0, so the scaling factor for dθ becomes zero. Therefore, the length of ∂/∂θ would go to zero. 

Alternatively, if φ were the azimuthal angle, then the roles would be different, but the problem states it's the north pole where φ=0, so I think φ is the polar angle. 

Therefore, the calculation seems correct. The length is r sinφ, which is zero when φ=0. Therefore, the answer is zero. 

But let me check another way. The tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole is a vertical vector, but in the standard coordinates, at the pole, the ∂/∂θ direction becomes undefined or requires a different coordinate system. Wait, maybe there's a problem with the coordinate system at the pole. 

In standard spherical coordinates, the ∂/∂θ vectors are circles of latitude, which at the pole collapse to a point. Hence, their length should be zero. However, in the metric given, the coefficient for dθ is r² sin²φ, which is zero at φ=0. Therefore, the metric itself causes the ∂/∂θ vector to have zero length there. 

Therefore, even though the coordinate system might be singular at the pole (since φ=0 is a point, not a line), the metric components make sense. The metric tensor is diagonal with g_{θθ} zero at φ=0, so the inner product of ∂/∂θ with itself is zero. 

So, the conclusion is that the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole is zero. The verification is done by plugging φ=0 into the expression for the length, which indeed gives zero. 

Therefore, the final answer is zero, and the verification confirms it.

","Okay, so I need to calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole N of the sphere S² with radius r. The metric given is g = r² dφ ⊗ dφ + r² sin²φ dθ ⊗ dθ. Hmm, let's see. 

First, I remember that the length of a tangent vector at a point on a manifold can be found using the metric tensor. The formula for the length of a vector field X at a point is the square root of the inner product of X with itself, using the metric. So, if X is ∂/∂θ, then its length squared would be g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ), which is just the component of the metric tensor corresponding to θθ, right?

Looking at the metric, the components are g_φφ = r² and g_θθ = r² sin²φ. Since ∂/∂θ is a vector in the θ direction, the length squared should be g_θθ. So, ||∂/∂θ|| = sqrt(g_θθ) = sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ. 

Wait, but the question is specifically at the north pole where φ = 0. So, plugging in φ = 0, we get sin(0) = 0. Therefore, the length should be zero. But is that correct? Let me think again. 

Hold on, maybe I need to be careful here. The metric components are given in spherical coordinates, where φ is the polar angle (from the north pole) and θ is the azimuthal angle. At the north pole, φ = 0, which is the point where the polar angle is zero. In spherical coordinates, the coordinates are singular at the poles, meaning that the standard coordinate system breaks down there. 

But even so, the metric components are given explicitly here. The component g_θθ is r² sin²φ. So, at φ = 0, sinφ = 0, hence g_θθ = 0. Therefore, the length of the ∂/∂θ vector at the north pole should indeed be zero. 

But why is that? Intuitively, at the north pole, the direction of θ becomes undefined or degenerate. Because at the pole, all the longitude lines meet, so moving in the θ direction (which is like going around a longitude circle) from the north pole doesn't really move you in any direction; it's just the pole itself. So, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the pole should be zero because there's no actual direction to go in that case. 

But let me verify this with the metric. The metric tensor components are used to compute the inner product of vectors. Since g_θθ = 0 at φ = 0, the inner product of ∂/∂θ with itself is zero, so the length is zero. That seems consistent. 

However, I should also consider if the coordinate system is valid at the north pole. In standard spherical coordinates, the coordinates (φ, θ) are not regular at the poles because the coordinate lines become degenerate. But even if the coordinates are singular, the metric components can still be evaluated there. So, even though the coordinate system is singular, the metric components are still defined, and g_θθ is zero at φ = 0. 

Therefore, the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole is zero. That makes sense because at the pole, the θ direction collapses. 

Wait, but just to be thorough, maybe I should also consider the definition of the tangent vector in this context. The tangent space at a point on a manifold is made up of all possible tangent vectors at that point. In coordinates, the basis vectors are ∂/∂φ and ∂/∂θ. However, at the north pole, the coordinate φ is zero, and the coordinate θ is still present. But the problem is that θ is an angle around the pole, so as φ approaches zero, the circles of constant φ (which are latitude circles) shrink to a point at the pole. 

Therefore, the vector ∂/∂θ at the pole would be a vector that is tangent to a circle which has collapsed to a point, hence it must be zero. That aligns with the calculation from the metric. 

Alternatively, if I consider the sphere parameterized by φ and θ, then near the pole, the θ direction is along the longitude, but at the pole, all longitudes meet, so there's no unique direction for θ. Thus, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ is not defined or is zero at the pole. 

Therefore, both the metric calculation and the geometric interpretation lead to the conclusion that the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole is zero. So, the answer should be that the length is zero, confirming the statement that it is zero at the north pole.

**Final Answer**
The length of the tangent vector \\( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\) at the north pole is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, so I need to find the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole of the sphere S² with radius r, using the given metric. The metric is provided as g = r² dφ ⊗ dφ + r² sin²φ dθ ⊗ dθ. And then check if the length is zero at the north pole where φ = 0. Hmm, let me think step by step.

First, I remember that the length of a tangent vector on a Riemannian manifold is calculated using the metric tensor. For a vector field X, the length squared at a point is given by g(X, X). So in this case, the vector we're interested in is ∂/∂θ. So I need to compute g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ).

Looking at the metric, it's expressed in terms of coordinates φ and θ. The metric tensor components are g_φφ = r² and g_θθ = r² sin²φ. Since the metric is diagonal, the off-diagonal components g_φθ and g_θφ are zero. That simplifies things because then the inner product of ∂/∂θ with itself is just g_θθ. So, g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ) = g_θθ = r² sin²φ.

Therefore, the length should be the square root of that, which is r sinφ. Wait, but we're evaluating this at the north pole where φ = 0. Let me check: at φ = 0, sinφ = 0, so the length becomes r * 0 = 0. So does that mean the length is zero at the north pole?

But hold on, intuitively, the tangent vectors at the north pole... The sphere's tangent space at the north pole should have vectors that correspond to moving around the pole, right? But in spherical coordinates, θ is the azimuthal angle, like longitude, and φ is the polar angle, like latitude. So at the north pole, φ = 0, and the θ direction is undefined there because it's a point. So perhaps the coordinate system has a singularity at the north pole, similar to how θ is undefined at the poles in spherical coordinates.

But according to the metric given, the g_θθ component is r² sin²φ. So when φ = 0, sinφ = 0, so g_θθ = 0. Therefore, the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole is zero. But that seems counterintuitive. How can the tangent vector have zero length if it's a valid tangent vector?

Wait, maybe the issue is that at the north pole, the coordinate θ becomes degenerate. The standard spherical coordinates have a coordinate singularity at the poles, meaning that the coordinate system isn't valid there. So perhaps even though we have a tangent vector ∂/∂θ, in reality, at the north pole, the θ direction collapses, so the tangent vector has zero length. That might make sense. So the answer would be that the length is zero at the north pole.

But let me verify this with another approach. Suppose I parameterize the sphere using coordinates (φ, θ). The north pole is at φ = 0, θ arbitrary. The tangent vector ∂/∂θ at any point (φ, θ) corresponds to moving in the azimuthal direction. But as φ approaches 0, the radius of the latitude circles (which are circles of constant φ) shrinks to zero. The length of ∂/∂θ should correspond to the circumference of the latitude circle divided by 2π. The circumference at latitude φ is 2π r sinφ, so the length of ∂/∂θ should be (2π r sinφ)/(2π) = r sinφ. That matches the earlier calculation. Therefore, at φ = 0, the circumference is zero, so the length is zero. That seems consistent.

But then why do we say that there are tangent vectors at the north pole? Shouldn't the tangent space be non-trivial there? Oh, but in the standard sphere, the tangent space at any point is 2-dimensional. So even at the north pole, there should be two linearly independent tangent vectors. However, in the spherical coordinates (φ, θ), the coordinate system breaks down at the poles. So perhaps, even though there are tangent vectors, in the coordinate basis, ∂/∂θ becomes degenerate there.

Alternatively, maybe we need to change coordinates near the north pole to better understand the tangent vectors. For example, using polar coordinates with a different origin or something. But maybe that's complicating things. The problem is straightforward using the given metric.

Given that the metric is g = r² dφ ⊗ dφ + r² sin²φ dθ ⊗ dθ, the components are clear. So the length of ∂/∂θ is sqrt(g_θθ) = r sinφ. At φ = 0, it's zero. So the answer is zero. Therefore, the length is zero at the north pole.

Wait, but I need to make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Let me check with another example. For instance, on the unit sphere, the metric in spherical coordinates is dφ ⊗ dφ + sin²φ dθ ⊗ dθ. Then the length of ∂/∂θ is sqrt(sin²φ) = sinφ, which at φ = 0 is zero. So that's the same. So even if the sphere has radius r, it's multiplied by r², so sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ, which still goes to zero at φ = 0. So yes, the length is zero.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole is zero. Hence, verified.

**Final Answer**
The length of the tangent vector at the north pole is \\boxed{0}.

","Okay, let's try to figure out the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole of the sphere S² using the given metric. Hmm, first I need to recall how tangent vectors and their lengths work with a metric tensor. The metric is given by g = r² dφ ⊗ dφ + r² sin²φ dθ ⊗ dθ. So, this is the standard metric for a sphere in spherical coordinates, right? 

Wait, the coordinates here are φ and θ. I need to make sure I understand which coordinate corresponds to what. Typically, in spherical coordinates, φ is the polar angle from the north pole, and θ is the azimuthal angle around the pole. But sometimes people switch them. The problem mentions the north pole where φ = 0, so that must mean φ is the polar angle decreasing from the north pole. So, as φ increases, we move south from the north pole. And θ is the longitude, going around the pole.

Now, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ would be a vector that points in the direction of increasing θ at each point on the sphere. The length of this vector should depend on the metric. Since the metric has components g_{φφ} = r² and g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ, the length of ∂/∂θ should be sqrt(g_{θθ}) when evaluated at a particular point.

But wait, the length of a tangent vector is given by the square root of the inner product of the vector with itself, using the metric. So, for the vector ∂/∂θ, the inner product g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ) would be g_{θθ}, right? Because the metric applied to the vector and itself gives the component squared. Therefore, the length should be sqrt(g_{θθ}) = sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ.

But the question is asking about the length at the north pole where φ = 0. Plugging φ = 0 into that expression, we get r sin 0 = 0. So, the length should be zero at the north pole. But wait, is that correct? Because at the north pole, all the points with φ = 0 are just the single point, right? So, θ is not really defined there because there's no longitude at that point. So, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole might not be a well-defined vector. Hmm, this is confusing.

Maybe I need to think about how the coordinates behave at the north pole. In standard spherical coordinates, the coordinate φ = 0 is the north pole, and θ is the azimuthal angle. But in this metric, φ is the polar angle. So, as we approach the north pole, φ approaches 0, and sinφ approaches 0, which makes the g_{θθ} component go to zero. That suggests that the length of the ∂/∂θ vector becomes zero at the north pole. But does that mean the vector itself is zero? Or is it just that the coordinate system isn't well-defined there?

Wait, at the north pole, the coordinates are not regular. In other words, the point φ = 0 is a singular point for the coordinate system because θ doesn't have a unique value there. So, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ isn't really defined there. Therefore, even though the metric component g_{θθ} is zero, the vector ∂/∂θ isn't zero; rather, it's not part of the tangent space at that point because the coordinates are singular there.

But the problem is asking to calculate the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole. Maybe they expect us to compute it using the given metric components, even though in reality the tangent vector isn't defined there. If we proceed formally, then the length would be zero because g_{θθ} = 0 when φ = 0. So, perhaps the answer is zero, even though in a more rigorous sense, the vector doesn't exist there.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the limit as we approach the north pole. If we take a point approaching φ = 0, then the length of ∂/∂θ would approach zero. So, in that sense, the length is zero at the north pole. But again, in the tangent space at the north pole, the vector ∂/∂θ isn't present because θ isn't a valid coordinate there.

I'm a bit confused about this. Let me check with a different approach. Let's recall that on the sphere, the tangent space at any point is two-dimensional. For the north pole, the tangent space should consist of vectors that go around the pole, but θ is the azimuthal coordinate. However, since the north pole is a single point, the tangent vectors at that point can't have a θ component. Wait, but in reality, the tangent vectors at the north pole can be in any direction tangent to the sphere there. But in the coordinate system, θ is not defined there, so the coordinate basis vector ∂/∂θ isn't a valid tangent vector at the north pole. Therefore, it's not part of the tangent space, so its length isn't defined in the usual sense.

But the problem is still asking to calculate the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole. Maybe they expect us to use the metric expression directly. If we do that, then g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ, so at φ = 0, g_{θθ} = 0, so the length is zero. But strictly speaking, the vector ∂/∂θ isn't in the tangent space at φ = 0. So, perhaps the answer is zero, but with a caveat that the vector isn't actually present there.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is trying to trick us into thinking that even though the coordinate is singular, the metric still gives a length. But in reality, the tangent vectors at the north pole don't have θ components because θ isn't defined there. So, the length should be zero, but the vector itself isn't a valid tangent vector at that point.

I need to reconcile these thoughts. Let's see. If we use the formula for the length of a tangent vector, which is sqrt(g_{ij} v^i v^j), then for the vector ∂/∂θ, the components are v^φ = 0 and v^θ = 1. So, plugging into the formula, we get sqrt(g_{θθ} * 1^2) = sqrt(r² sin²φ). At φ = 0, that's sqrt(r² * 0) = 0. So, the calculation gives zero, but the vector ∂/∂θ isn't actually in the tangent space at the north pole. Therefore, the answer is zero, but the interpretation is a bit tricky.

Perhaps the problem is testing the understanding that even though the coordinate is singular, the metric still gives a length of zero. So, the answer is zero, and that's how it's verified.

Therefore, the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole is zero, as per the metric calculation, even though the vector isn't part of the tangent space there in a coordinate-independent way.

**Final Answer**
The length of the tangent vector at the north pole is \\boxed{0}.

","Okay, let me try to figure out how to calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole N of the sphere S² with radius r, given this metric. Hmm, first, I need to recall how the length of a tangent vector is determined using a metric. 

The metric provided is g = r² dφ ⊗ dφ + r² sin²φ dθ ⊗ dθ. So this is a diagonal metric tensor, right? The components are g_{φφ} = r² and g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ. The other components, like g_{φθ} and g_{θφ}, are zero because the metric is diagonal. 

Now, to find the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ, I think the formula is the square root of the inner product of the vector with itself. In terms of the metric, that would be sqrt(g_{ij} e^i e^j), where e^i are the components of the vector. Since ∂/∂θ is a standard basis vector, its components in the φ and θ directions are (0,1). So plugging into the metric, the inner product should be g_{θθ}*(1)^2 = r² sin²φ *1 = r² sin²φ. Then the length is sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ. 

But wait, the north pole is at φ = 0. So plugging φ = 0 into that expression gives r sin0 = 0. So the length is zero at the north pole. That makes sense because at the north pole, the direction of θ becomes a ""pointing"" direction, but in reality, it's a degenerate direction there since you can't move along θ at the pole. So the tangent vector ∂/∂θ collapses to zero length there. 

Let me double-check. The metric at φ=0 would have g_{θθ} = r² sin²0 = 0. So indeed, the component g_{θθ} is zero, which means that the inner product of ∂/∂θ with itself is zero. Hence, the length is zero. 

I think that's correct. Maybe I should also consider if there's any coordinate singularity at the north pole. The coordinates (φ, θ) are polar coordinates, so φ=0 is the north pole, and θ is the longitude. The tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the pole is indeed not a valid vector in the tangent space because moving in θ direction doesn't make sense there. Hence, its length being zero aligns with that. 

Another way to think about it: if you approach the north pole from a point with a small φ angle, the circumference in the θ direction is 2πr sinφ, which approaches zero as φ approaches zero. So the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ, which should correspond to an infinitesimal displacement along θ, would also approach zero. That confirms the calculation. 

I don't see any mistakes here. The key steps were identifying the metric components, applying the formula for the length of a vector, and evaluating at φ=0. Everything checks out.

","Okay, so I need to calculate the length of the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at the north pole of the sphere S², given the metric g. The metric is given as g = r² dφ⊗dφ + r² sin²φ dθ⊗dθ. And I also need to verify if the length is zero at the north pole where φ=0. Hmm, let's start by recalling some basic differential geometry concepts.

First, the length of a tangent vector in a Riemannian manifold is given by the square root of the metric tensor applied to the vector. So, if I have a vector X, its length is √(g(X,X)). In this case, the vector is ∂/∂θ, so I need to compute g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ). 

Looking at the metric, it's written in terms of dφ and dθ. The metric tensor components are g_{φφ} = r², g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ, and the off-diagonal components are zero because there are no cross terms like dφ⊗dθ or dθ⊗dφ. So, the inner product of ∂/∂θ with itself should just be g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ. Therefore, the length should be √(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ.

Now, at the north pole, φ=0. So plugging φ=0 into the expression, sin(0)=0. Therefore, the length is r*0=0. That seems straightforward. But wait, I should check if there are any subtleties here. For instance, is the coordinate system singular at the north pole? Yes, because in spherical coordinates, the φ angle is 0 at the north pole, and θ is the azimuthal angle. But the metric still makes sense there, right? The term sin²φ becomes zero, which makes the metric component g_{θθ} zero. So, the tangent vector ∂/∂θ at φ=0 has zero length according to this metric. 

But let me think deeper. Is there another way to see why the tangent vector at the north pole should have zero length? Well, at the north pole, the sphere's geometry becomes such that the θ direction is collapsed into a point. So, intuitively, moving in the θ direction at the north pole doesn't change your position, hence the tangent vector there should be zero-length. That makes sense. So the calculation checks out.

Wait, but what about the actual computation? Let's go through it step by step to be sure. The metric is g = r² dφ⊗dφ + r² sin²φ dθ⊗dθ. So, the components are g_{φφ} = r², g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ, and others zero. So, the inner product g(∂/∂θ, ∂/∂θ) is just g_{θθ} = r² sin²φ. Therefore, the length is sqrt(r² sin²φ) = r sinφ. At φ=0, sinφ=0, so the length is zero. Therefore, the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole is zero. 

Is there any alternative perspective? For example, using the standard sphere metric in spherical coordinates, which is usually written as ds² = r² dφ² + r² sin²φ dθ². So, the components are the same as given here. Therefore, yes, the length of ∂/∂θ is r sinφ, which is zero at φ=0. 

Another way to think about it is via parametrization. If we parametrize the sphere with φ and θ, then at φ=0, the point is the north pole. The coordinates θ are measured around the pole, so the θ direction is a circle that collapses to a point at the pole. Therefore, the tangent vectors in the θ direction at the pole are zero vectors because they don't correspond to any actual movement on the sphere. So, that's another confirmation.

Therefore, after considering different angles—metric components, intuitive understanding, parametrization—it seems consistent that the length of ∂/∂θ at the north pole is zero. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning here. The key point is that the metric component g_{θθ} vanishes at φ=0, leading to the zero length. So the answer should be that the length is zero at the north pole.

**Final Answer**
The length of the tangent vector \\( \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\theta} \\) at the north pole is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).
