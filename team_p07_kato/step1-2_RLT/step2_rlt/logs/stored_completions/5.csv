To evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) such that \\( n > m \\), we start by using the binomial coefficient identity:

\\[
\\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Substituting this into the original sum, we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

We can factor out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\):

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Next, we change the summation index by letting \\( j = k - m \\). This transforms the sum into:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

This simplifies to:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

The remaining sum is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero for \\( n - m > 0 \\). Since \\( n > m \\), this sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to zero.

Thus, the final answer is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the sum S = ∑_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k * C(n, k) * C(k, m), where n and m are positive integers with n > m. Hmm, let's see. I remember that there are some binomial coefficient identities that might help here. Maybe I can manipulate the terms or use generating functions?

First, let me recall that C(n, k) * C(k, m) can be simplified. There's an identity: C(n, k) * C(k, m) = C(n, m) * C(n - m, k - m). Let me check that. Yes, this is the identity for the product of two binomial coefficients. So, C(n, k) * C(k, m) = C(n, m) * C(n - m, k - m). That seems right because you're choosing m elements from n first, and then k - m from the remaining n - m.

So substituting that into the original sum, we get S = C(n, m) * ∑_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k * C(n - m, k - m). Let me adjust the summation index. Let j = k - m, so when k = m, j = 0, and when k = n, j = n - m. So the sum becomes ∑_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} * C(n - m, j). Which is (-1)^m * ∑_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j).

Now, the sum ∑_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j) is the binomial expansion of (1 - 1)^{n - m}, right? Because the binomial theorem states that (a + b)^r = ∑_{k=0}^r C(r, k) a^{r - k} b^k. If we set a = 1 and b = -1, then (1 - 1)^{n - m} = ∑_{j=0}^{n - m} C(n - m, j) (-1)^j. So this sum is (0)^{n - m} which is 0 when n - m > 0, which it is because n > m. Therefore, the entire sum is zero. So S = C(n, m) * (-1)^m * 0 = 0.

Wait, so is the sum zero? Let me test with some small numbers to check. Let's take n = 2, m = 1. Then the sum is from k=1 to 2. For k=1: (-1)^1 * C(2,1)*C(1,1) = -1 * 2 * 1 = -2. For k=2: (-1)^2 * C(2,2)*C(2,1) = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2. Sum is -2 + 2 = 0. Okay, that works. Another example: n=3, m=1. Sum from k=1 to 3. k=1: -C(3,1)*C(1,1) = -3*1 = -3. k=2: C(3,2)*C(2,1) = 3*2 = 6. k=3: -C(3,3)*C(3,1) = -1*3 = -3. Sum: -3 +6 -3 =0. Hmm, still zero. Another test case: n=4, m=2. Sum from k=2 to 4. For k=2: (-1)^2 * C(4,2)*C(2,2) =1 *6*1=6. k=3: (-1)^3 * C(4,3)*C(3,2)= -1*4*3= -12. k=4: (-1)^4 * C(4,4)*C(4,2)=1*1*6=6. Sum:6 -12 +6=0. Yep, still zero. So seems like the result is always zero. Therefore, the sum S is zero when n > m.

But wait, let me check if the identity I used is correct. The step where I replaced the product of binomial coefficients with C(n, m)*C(n - m, k - m). Let me verify with a small example. Take n=3, m=1, k=2. Then C(3,2)*C(2,1) should equal C(3,1)*C(2,1). Let's compute: C(3,2)=3, C(2,1)=2. So 3*2=6. On the other side, C(3,1)=3, C(2,1)=2. So 3*2=6. Same result. Another example: n=4, m=2, k=3. C(4,3)*C(3,2)=4*3=12. C(4,2)*C(2,1)=6*2=12. Yep, works. So the identity is correct.

Therefore, the steps are valid. So the sum reduces to (-1)^m multiplied by the sum which is (1 -1)^{n - m}, which is zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero. But let me check another approach to confirm.

Alternative approach: Generating functions. Consider the generating function for the sum. Let me see. The term is (-1)^k * C(n, k) * C(k, m). Let's think of generating functions. The generating function for C(k, m) is x^m / (1 - x)^{m + 1}, but I need to see how to combine this with the (-1)^k and C(n, k).

Alternatively, note that C(k, m) is the coefficient of x^m in (1 + x)^k. Then, the sum S is ∑_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n, k) * [x^m] (1 + x)^k. Interchanging sum and coefficient extraction: [x^m] ∑_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n, k) (1 + x)^k. The sum inside is ∑_{k=m}^n C(n, k) (- (1 + x))^k. Which is part of the binomial expansion of (1 - (1 + x))^n = (-x)^n. But our sum is only from k=m to n. So ∑_{k=m}^n C(n, k) (- (1 + x))^k = (1 - (1 + x))^n - ∑_{k=0}^{m - 1} C(n, k) (- (1 + x))^k. Therefore, [x^m] [ (-x)^n - ∑_{k=0}^{m - 1} C(n, k) (- (1 + x))^k ]. The first term is [x^m] (-x)^n. If n > m, this is zero. The second term is [x^m] ∑_{k=0}^{m - 1} C(n, k) (- (1 + x))^k. Let's expand this. Each term in the sum is C(n, k) (-1)^k (1 + x)^k. The coefficient of x^m in this sum is ∑_{k=0}^{m - 1} C(n, k) (-1)^k C(k, m). Wait, but this is similar to the original sum but with upper limit m - 1 instead of n. However, since the original problem has n > m, and here we have k up to m - 1, but m is at least 1, so k can be 0 up to m -1. But if m >=1, then m -1 >=0. However, in the original problem, the sum is from k=m to n. So unless m=0, but m is a positive integer. Therefore, in the generating function approach, the first term is zero, and the second term is the sum we are trying to compute. Wait, but this seems circular. Maybe this approach is more complicated.

Alternatively, let's think of the sum S as the coefficient of x^m in ∑_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n, k) (1 + x)^k. Let's write this as [x^m] ∑_{k=0}^n (-1)^k C(n, k) (1 + x)^k. Because for k < m, the coefficient of x^m is zero. So S = [x^m] (1 - (1 + x))^n = [x^m] (-x)^n. If n > m, then (-x)^n has degree n, which is higher than m, so the coefficient is zero. Therefore, S =0. That's a more straightforward generating function approach. So that confirms the result.

Therefore, the sum is zero. So the answer is zero. So I can conclude that the sum is zero for all positive integers n and m with n > m. Therefore, the final answer is 0.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate this sum: the sum from k equals m to n of (-1)^k times the binomial coefficient (n choose k) times (k choose m). Hmm, let's see. First, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have two binomial coefficients multiplied together, one is (n choose k) and the other is (k choose m), and each term is multiplied by (-1)^k. The sum starts at k = m and goes up to k = n, and n is greater than m. We need to find a closed-form expression for this sum.

Alright, let's start by writing down the sum again to make sure I have it right:

S = Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) * C(k, m)

Where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient ""n choose k"". So, the first thing I notice is that both binomial coefficients here have k as a variable. Maybe there's a way to simplify this expression by manipulating the binomial coefficients.

I remember that sometimes binomial coefficients can be related through identities. Let me recall some binomial coefficient identities. One thing I remember is the identity C(n, k) * C(k, m) = C(n, m) * C(n - m, k - m). Wait, is that right? Let me check. If I have C(n, k) * C(k, m), that's the number of ways to choose k elements from n and then choose m elements from those k. Alternatively, this can be thought of as first choosing m elements from the n, and then choosing the remaining k - m elements from the remaining n - m. So, yes, C(n, m) * C(n - m, k - m). That seems correct.

So, applying that identity, the original sum S can be rewritten as:

S = Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, m) * C(n - m, k - m)

Since C(n, m) is constant with respect to k, we can factor that out:

S = C(n, m) * Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n - m, k - m)

Now, let's make a substitution to simplify the summation index. Let j = k - m. Then when k = m, j = 0, and when k = n, j = n - m. So the sum becomes:

S = C(n, m) * Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} * C(n - m, j)

Which can be written as:

S = C(n, m) * (-1)^m * Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j)

Now, the sum Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j) is the binomial expansion of (1 - 1)^{n - m}, right? Because the binomial theorem tells us that Σ_{j=0}^N C(N, j) * (-1)^j = (1 - 1)^N = 0^N. So, if n - m > 0, this sum is zero. But wait, n > m, so n - m is at least 1. Therefore, the sum is zero. Therefore, S would be C(n, m) * (-1)^m * 0 = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. So, starting from the original sum, we used the identity C(n, k)*C(k, m) = C(n, m)*C(n - m, k - m). Then we factored out C(n, m) and made the substitution j = k - m. Then we recognized the sum as the binomial expansion of (1 - 1)^{n - m}, which is zero for n - m > 0. Since n > m, this sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire sum S is zero.

But let me test this with some small values to make sure. Let's take n = 2 and m = 1. Then the sum is from k=1 to 2 of (-1)^k * C(2, k) * C(k, 1).

Calculating each term:

For k=1: (-1)^1 * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = -1 * 2 * 1 = -2

For k=2: (-1)^2 * C(2,2) * C(2,1) = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2

Sum: -2 + 2 = 0. Which matches the result.

Another test case: n=3, m=1. Sum from k=1 to 3:

k=1: (-1)^1 * C(3,1)*C(1,1) = -3*1 = -3

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*C(2,1) = 1*3*2 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*C(3,1) = -1*1*3 = -3

Sum: -3 +6 -3 =0. Again, zero. Hmm.

Another test case: n=3, m=2.

Sum from k=2 to 3:

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*C(2,2) =1*3*1=3

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*C(3,2)= -1*1*3= -3

Sum: 3 -3=0. Still zero.

Wait, so according to these test cases, the sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the general formula seems to hold. Therefore, the sum S is zero for all n > m.

But let me try to see if there's another way to approach this, perhaps using generating functions or another combinatorial interpretation, just to confirm.

Alternatively, consider that the sum is similar to an inclusion-exclusion principle. The binomial coefficients with alternating signs often come up in inclusion-exclusion. But in this case, the double binomial coefficients complicate things. However, the identity we used earlier seems to handle it.

Alternatively, think of generating functions. The generating function for the binomial coefficients C(n, k) is (1 + x)^n. Then the generating function for C(k, m) is x^m/(1 - x)^{m + 1}. But I'm not sure how to combine these. Wait, maybe not the right approach.

Alternatively, consider that C(n, k)*C(k, m) is the number of ways to choose a subset of size k from n elements, and then a subset of size m from those k. The sum over k from m to n of (-1)^k times that. Hmm, perhaps inclusion-exclusion here? If we think of selecting subsets with certain properties and alternating signs.

But perhaps the first approach is the most straightforward. Using the identity C(n, k)*C(k, m) = C(n, m)*C(n - m, k - m), then factoring out C(n, m), and then recognizing the sum as (1 - 1)^{n - m} which is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there's a generating function approach. Let's consider generating functions.

The sum S is equal to the coefficient of x^m in the generating function Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) * C(k, m) * x^m. Wait, but actually, C(k, m) is the coefficient of x^m in (1 + x)^k. So, the sum can be written as the coefficient of x^m in Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) * (1 + x)^k.

Therefore, S is the coefficient of x^m in (1 + x)^n * Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k). Wait, but Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) is part of the expansion of (1 - 1)^n, but only up to k = n. However, (1 - 1)^n = 0, but if we sum only up to k = n, it's still zero. Wait, but actually, the sum from k=0 to n of (-1)^k C(n, k) is (1 - 1)^n = 0. So the sum from k=m to n is equal to the sum from k=0 to n minus the sum from k=0 to m-1. But since the total sum is zero, then the sum from k=m to n is equal to - sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (-1)^k C(n, k). But I'm not sure if this helps.

Alternatively, the generating function approach: Let's write S as the coefficient of x^m in (1 + x)^n multiplied by Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n, k). Wait, but Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n, k) is equal to (-1)^m C(n, m) + (-1)^{m+1} C(n, m+1) + ... + (-1)^n C(n, n). This is the same as the sum from k=m to n of (-1)^k C(n, k). Which is equal to (-1)^m Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j C(n, m + j). But I don't see a direct connection here.

Wait, but perhaps another way. Let me think. If we have the generating function for the binomial coefficients with alternating signs, that's (1 - 1)^n = 0. So, the sum S is a part of this expansion. But in our case, we have an extra factor of C(k, m). So, maybe the generating function is (1 + x)^k, and we need the coefficient of x^m in that. So, overall, S is the coefficient of x^m in (1 + x)^n * Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n, k). But Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n, k) is the same as the sum from k=0 to n of (-1)^k C(n, k) minus the sum from k=0 to m-1. But since the total sum is zero, this is equal to - sum_{k=0}^{m-1} (-1)^k C(n, k). But I don't see how that helps us here.

Alternatively, let's think of the original sum again. S = Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n, k) C(k, m). Let's use the identity C(n, k) C(k, m) = C(n, m) C(n - m, k - m). So, S = C(n, m) Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n - m, k - m). Let j = k - m, so S = C(n, m) Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} C(n - m, j) = C(n, m) (-1)^m Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j C(n - m, j). As before, the sum is (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0, so S = 0. Therefore, regardless of the test cases, the sum is zero.

Therefore, the answer should be 0. But let me check one more test case where n and m are larger. Let's take n=4, m=2.

Sum from k=2 to 4 of (-1)^k * C(4, k) * C(k, 2).

Calculating each term:

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(4,2)*C(2,2) = 1 * 6 * 1 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(4,3)*C(3,2) = -1 * 4 * 3 = -12

k=4: (-1)^4 * C(4,4)*C(4,2) = 1 * 1 * 6 = 6

Sum: 6 -12 +6 = 0. Yep, still zero. Seems consistent.

Another test case: n=5, m=3.

Sum from k=3 to 5:

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(5,3)*C(3,3) = -1 * 10 * 1 = -10

k=4: (-1)^4 * C(5,4)*C(4,3) = 1 *5 *4 = 20

k=5: (-1)^5 * C(5,5)*C(5,3) = -1 *1 *10 = -10

Sum: -10 +20 -10=0. Still zero. Hmm.

Therefore, all test cases confirm that the sum is zero. Therefore, the general formula is zero. So, the answer is 0.

But just to be thorough, let me try to think if there's any possible mistake in the reasoning. For example, the identity C(n, k) C(k, m) = C(n, m) C(n - m, k - m). Let me verify this identity with some numbers.

Take n=3, k=2, m=1. Then C(3,2)*C(2,1) = 3*2=6. C(3,1)*C(2,1)=3*2=6. Correct. Another example: n=4, k=3, m=2. C(4,3)*C(3,2)=4*3=12. C(4,2)*C(2,1)=6*2=12. Correct. So the identity holds. Therefore, the substitution is valid.

Therefore, the steps are correct. The sum S is equal to C(n, m) times the sum over j of (-1)^{j + m} C(n - m, j), which is C(n, m)*(-1)^m*(1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0. Hence, the sum is zero.

Therefore, the answer is zero. All test cases and the general proof via binomial identities and substitution lead to the conclusion that the sum is zero for all n > m. Therefore, the final answer is 0.

First, the binomial coefficients \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) and \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\). I know that binomial coefficients often appear in combinatorial identities, so maybe there's a way to simplify this expression using known identities. Let me recall some binomial coefficient properties.

One thing that comes to mind is the identity that relates the product of two binomial coefficients. Specifically, \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). There's a identity that says \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me verify that. If I think of choosing \\( k \\) elements from \\( n \\), and then choosing \\( m \\) elements from those \\( k \\), it's equivalent to first choosing \\( m \\) elements from \\( n \\), and then choosing \\( k - m \\) elements from the remaining \\( n - m \\). That seems right. So yes, \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\).

So substituting this into the original sum, we get:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

Since \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\) is a constant with respect to \\( k \\), we can factor it out of the sum:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

Now, let's make a substitution to simplify the summation. Let \\( j = k - m \\). Then when \\( k = m \\), \\( j = 0 \\), and when \\( k = n \\), \\( j = n - m \\). So the sum becomes:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

We can factor out \\( (-1)^m \\) from the sum:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

Now, the remaining sum is \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\). This looks familiar. It's the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), right? Because \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{m} \\binom{m}{j} (-1)^j = (1 - 1)^m = 0^m \\). So, applying that here, if \\( n - m > 0 \\), then the sum is zero. But if \\( n - m = 0 \\), then the sum is \\( (-1)^0 \\binom{0}{0} = 1 \\).

But wait, the problem states that \\( n > m \\), which means \\( n - m \\geq 1 \\). Therefore, the sum \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} = 0 \\).

Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\times 0 = 0 \\)

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Let me check again. If \\( n - m \\geq 1 \\), then \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0^{n - m} = 0 \\), so the sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire expression is zero.

But let me verify this with a small example to ensure I didn't make a mistake. Let's take \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\). Then the sum is from \\( k = 1 \\) to \\( 2 \\):

For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( (-1)^1 \\binom{2}{1} \\binom{1}{1} = -1 * 2 * 1 = -2 \\)

For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{1} = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2 \\)

Adding them up: -2 + 2 = 0. Which matches our result.

Another example: \\( n = 3 \\), \\( m = 1 \\). Sum from \\( k=1 \\) to 3:

\\( k=1 \\): (-1)^1 * 3 * 1 = -3

\\( k=2 \\): (-1)^2 * 3 * 2 = 6

\\( k=3 \\): (-1)^3 * 1 * 3 = -3

Total: -3 + 6 -3 = 0. Again, it works.

Another example: \\( n=3 \\), \\( m=2 \\). Then sum from \\( k=2 \\) to 3:

\\( k=2 \\): (-1)^2 * 3 * 1 = 3

\\( k=3 \\): (-1)^3 * 1 * 3 = -3

Total: 0. Yep.

So the conclusion seems to be that the sum is zero. Therefore, the evaluated sum is zero for all positive integers \\( n > m \\).

But wait, let me check if there's another approach. Maybe using generating functions or inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, the original sum can be written as a combination of binomial coefficients with alternating signs. Let's think of generating functions.

The sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). Let's consider generating functions for both binomial coefficients.

We know that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k x^k = (1 - x)^n \\).

But here, we have an extra \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) term. So perhaps we can use generating functions with an additional factor.

Alternatively, recall that \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{k}{m} x^k = \\frac{x^m}{(1 - x)^{m + 1}}} \\).

But maybe combining these ideas. Let me see. If we consider generating functions, the term \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) can be represented as the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in \\( (1 + x)^k \\). Wait, actually, \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in \\( (1 + x)^k \\). So perhaps we can write the sum as:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} [x^m] (1 + x)^k \\)

Then interchange the sum and the coefficient extraction:

\\( [x^m] \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k \\)

But \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k (1 + x)^k = (1 - (1 + x))^n = (-x)^n \\)

But since we start the sum at \\( k = m \\), we can write:

\\( [x^m] \\left( (-x)^n - \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k (1 + x)^k \\right) \\)

But this seems complicated. However, if \\( n > m \\), then the term \\( (-x)^n \\) will have a coefficient of \\( [x^m] (-x)^n = 0 \\) if \\( n > m \\). Therefore, the entire expression would be \\( - [x^m] \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k (1 + x)^k \\).

But this seems messy. Maybe this approach isn't the easiest.

Alternatively, let's consider the original identity we used. We transformed the sum using the binomial coefficient identity and found that the sum is zero. The examples also confirm this. Therefore, unless there's a mistake in the steps, the answer should be zero.

Wait, but let me check another case where \\( n = m + 1 \\). Let's take \\( n = 2 \\), \\( m = 1 \\). As before, we get 0. If \\( n = 4 \\), \\( m = 1 \\), sum from k=1 to 4:

k=1: (-1)^1 * 4 * 1 = -4

k=2: (-1)^2 * 6 * 2 = 12

k=3: (-1)^3 * 4 * 3 = -12

k=4: (-1)^4 * 1 * 4 = 4

Total: -4 +12 -12 +4 = 0. Yep.

Another check with \\( n = 3 \\), \\( m = 2 \\):

k=2: (-1)^2 * 3 * 1 = 3

k=3: (-1)^3 * 1 * 3 = -3

Total: 0.

So seems consistent. Therefore, the conclusion is that the sum is zero.

But wait, let me see if there's a general proof. The identity we used earlier:

\\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} = 0 \\) for \\( n > 0 \\).

In our problem, after substitution, the sum reduces to this identity. Therefore, the sum is zero.

Alternatively, using inclusion-exclusion. Suppose we have a set of size \\( n \\), and we want to count the number of subsets of size \\( k \\) (from \\( n \\)), then subtract subsets of size \\( m \\) from each of those. But the alternating signs might complicate things. However, the inclusion-exclusion principle often relies on such alternating sums, but it's not straightforward here.

Alternatively, think combinatorially: the sum is the inclusion-exclusion over subsets of size \\( k \\), each contributing \\( (-1)^k \\), multiplied by the number of ways to choose a subset of size \\( m \\) from each subset of size \\( k \\). But since \\( n > m \\), the net result cancels out, leading to zero.

Therefore, after multiple approaches and checks, the sum evaluates to zero.

We can factor out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\):

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m}

Next, we change the summation index by letting \\( j = k - m \\). This transforms the sum into:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j}

This simplifies to:

\\[

The remaining sum is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero for \\( n - m > 0 \\). Since \\( n > m \\), this sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to zero.

Thus, the final answer is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) where \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) are positive integers with \\( n > m \\). Hmm, let's see. I remember that binomial coefficients often appear in combinatorial identities, and sometimes generating functions or inclusion-exclusion principles can help here. Let me start by breaking down the problem.

First, the sum is from \\( k = m \\) to \\( k = n \\). Each term is \\( (-1)^k \\) multiplied by \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). Let me write out the first few terms to see if I can spot a pattern. Let's take small values for \\( n \\) and \\( m \\). Suppose \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\). Then the sum becomes:

For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( (-1)^1 \\binom{3}{1} \\binom{1}{1} = -3 * 1 = -3 \\)

For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{2}{1} = 3 * 2 = 6 \\)

For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( (-1)^3 \\binom{3}{3} \\binom{3}{1} = -1 * 3 = -3 \\)

Adding these up: -3 + 6 -3 = 0. Hmm, interesting. Let's try another example. Let \\( n = 4 \\), \\( m = 2 \\):

Sum from \\( k = 2 \\) to \\( 4 \\):

k=2: (-1)^2 * 6 * 1 = 6*1 =6

k=3: (-1)^3 *4 *3= -12

k=4: (-1)^4 *1 *6=6

Total: 6 -12 +6=0. Again, zero. Maybe the sum is always zero? Let's check another one. \\( n=2 \\), \\( m=1 \\):

k=1: (-1)^1 *2*1= -2

k=2: (-1)^2 *1*2=2

Sum: -2 +2=0. Still zero. Hmm, so maybe the sum is always zero when \\( n > m \\). But wait, let's check \\( n=1 \\), \\( m=0 \\). Wait, but the problem states \\( m \\) is a positive integer, so maybe \\( m=0 \\) isn't considered. So perhaps for all \\( n > m \\geq 1 \\), the sum is zero. But why?

Alternatively, maybe there's a general identity here. Let me think. The term \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) can be simplified. There's an identity that says \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me verify that.

Yes, that's a standard identity. The idea is that choosing \\( k \\) elements from \\( n \\), and then \\( m \\) elements from those \\( k \\), is the same as first choosing \\( m \\) elements from \\( n \\), and then choosing the remaining \\( k - m \\) elements from the remaining \\( n - m \\). So,

\\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\).

Therefore, substituting into the original sum:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\).

Let’s adjust the summation index by letting \\( j = k - m \\). Then when \\( k = m \\), \\( j = 0 \\), and when \\( k = n \\), \\( j = n - m \\). So the sum becomes:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\).

Factor out \\( (-1)^m \\):

\\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\).

Now, the sum \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\) is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is \\( 0^{n - m} \\). Since \\( n > m \\), \\( n - m \\geq 1 \\), so this sum is zero. Therefore, the entire expression is zero.

Wait, so that's the case. Therefore, the sum is zero for all \\( n > m \\geq 1 \\). But let me check again with another example where \\( n = 5 \\), \\( m = 2 \\):

Original sum: sum from k=2 to 5 of (-1)^k * C(5,k)*C(k,2)

Compute each term:

k=2: (-1)^2 * 10 * 1 = 10

k=3: (-1)^3 *10 *3 = -30

k=4: (-1)^4 *5 *6 =30

k=5: (-1)^5 *1 *10 =-10

Total: 10 -30 +30 -10=0. Yep, works. So according to the identity, the sum is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

But let me think again. The key step was using the identity for the product of binomial coefficients. Let me confirm that again. So \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Yes, this is correct because you can think of first choosing m elements out of n, then choosing k - m elements out of the remaining n - m. So that's a standard combinatorial identity.

Therefore, the sum simplifies to \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\), which factors into \\( (-1)^m \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\). The sum here is the expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero when \\( n - m \\geq 1 \\). Therefore, the entire expression is zero.

Therefore, regardless of the values of \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) (as long as \\( n > m \\geq 1 \\)), the sum is always zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

","Alright, so I need to evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) where \\( n > m \\) are positive integers. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this sum represents. It involves binomial coefficients multiplied by alternating signs. Maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation or a generating function approach here?

First, let's recall that \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) can be simplified using the identity \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me verify that. If I choose \\( k \\) elements out of \\( n \\), and then \\( m \\) elements out of those \\( k \\), it's equivalent to first choosing \\( m \\) elements out of \\( n \\), and then \\( k - m \\) elements out of the remaining \\( n - m \\). So yes, that identity holds. Therefore, the sum becomes:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

We can factor out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\) since it doesn't depend on \\( k \\):

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

Now, let's change the summation index to make it simpler. Let \\( j = k - m \\). Then when \\( k = m \\), \\( j = 0 \\), and when \\( k = n \\), \\( j = n - m \\). So the sum becomes:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

Which simplifies to:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

The sum \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\) is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is \\( 0^{n - m} \\). However, since \\( n > m \\), \\( n - m \\) is at least 1, so \\( 0^{n - m} = 0 \\). Therefore, the entire sum should be zero. Wait, but hold on, if \\( n - m = 0 \\), which would mean \\( n = m \\), but the problem states \\( n > m \\), so \\( n - m \\geq 1 \\). Hence, the sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the original sum is \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\times (-1)^m \\times 0 = 0 \\).

But wait, let me check if I did everything correctly. Let's test with a small example. Let \\( m = 1 \\), \\( n = 2 \\). Then the sum is \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{2} (-1)^k \\binom{2}{k} \\binom{k}{1} \\).

Calculating each term:

For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( (-1)^1 \\times \\binom{2}{1} \\times \\binom{1}{1} = -1 \\times 2 \\times 1 = -2 \\)

For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\times \\binom{2}{2} \\times \\binom{2}{1} = 1 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\)

Total sum: -2 + 2 = 0. That matches the result.

Another example: \\( m = 2 \\), \\( n = 3 \\).

Sum over \\( k = 2, 3 \\):

For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\times \\binom{3}{2} \\times \\binom{2}{2} = 1 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\)

For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( (-1)^3 \\times \\binom{3}{3} \\times \\binom{3}{2} = -1 \\times 1 \\times 3 = -3 \\)

Total sum: 3 - 3 = 0. Again, zero.

So the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the sum is zero for any \\( n > m \\).

But wait, let me think again. Maybe there's another way to approach this. Let's consider generating functions. The sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\).

We can write \\( \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{k}{k - m} \\), so the sum is \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{k - m} \\).

This resembles the coefficient extraction. Let's consider the generating function for \\( \\binom{k}{k - m} \\). Alternatively, note that \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in \\( (1 + x)^k \\). Therefore, the sum can be written as the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k \\).

So, let's write:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} (- (1 + x))^k \\)

This is a partial sum of the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - (1 + x))^n \\), but truncated at \\( k = n \\). However, since \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} (- (1 + x))^k = (1 - (1 + x))^n = (-x)^n \\). But our sum is from \\( k = m \\) to \\( n \\). Therefore, the sum is equal to \\( (-x)^n - \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\binom{n}{k} (- (1 + x))^k \\).

But we need the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in this expression. So, the original sum we want is the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in \\( (-x)^n - \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\binom{n}{k} (- (1 + x))^k \\).

The coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in \\( (-x)^n \\) is zero if \\( n \\neq m \\), and \\( (-1)^n \\) if \\( n = m \\). But since \\( n > m \\), this term contributes zero. Therefore, the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in the entire expression is equal to the negative of the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\binom{n}{k} (- (1 + x))^k \\).

But since \\( k \\) goes up to \\( m - 1 \\), and we are looking for \\( x^m \\), each term \\( \\binom{n}{k} (- (1 + x))^k \\) will have a maximum degree of \\( k \\), which is less than \\( m \\). Therefore, the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in the sum is zero. Hence, the entire expression is zero. Therefore, the original sum is zero.

Alternatively, another approach: using inclusion-exclusion or combinatorial interpretations. Suppose we have a set of \\( n \\) elements, and we want to count something with inclusion-exclusion. The term \\( (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) might be related to inclusion-exclusion where we subtract and add counts based on subsets.

But perhaps the first method is sufficient. Both the algebraic manipulation and the generating function approach lead to the conclusion that the sum is zero. Also, testing with examples confirms it. Therefore, the answer should be zero.

To evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) such that \\( n > m \\), we start by using the binomial coefficient identity:

\\[
\\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Substituting this into the original sum, we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

We can factor out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\):

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Next, we change the summation index by letting \\( j = k - m \\). This transforms the sum into:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

This simplifies to:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

The remaining sum is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero for \\( n - m > 0 \\). Since \\( n > m \\), this sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to zero.

Thus, the final answer is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) where \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) are positive integers with \\( n > m \\). Hmm, let's see. I remember that binomial coefficients often come up in combinatorial identities, and sums involving alternating signs can sometimes be tackled using generating functions or inclusion-exclusion principles. Let me start by understanding the components of this sum.

First, the term \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) elements from a set of \\( n \\). Then, \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is the number of ways to choose \\( m \\) elements from those \\( k \\). Multiplying them together gives the number of ways to first choose \\( k \\) elements from \\( n \\), and then choose \\( m \\) elements from those \\( k \\). But then we have the alternating sign \\( (-1)^k \\). So the entire sum is an alternating sum of these products.

Maybe there's a way to interpret this combinatorially. Let me think. Suppose we have a set of \\( n \\) elements. We pick a subset of size \\( k \\), then pick a subset of size \\( m \\) from that subset. But then we alternate the sign based on \\( k \\). So perhaps this is related to inclusion-exclusion where we are subtracting and adding contributions from different subsets.

Alternatively, maybe generating functions can help here. Let me recall that generating functions can be used to evaluate sums involving binomial coefficients. Let's consider the generating function for the inner binomial coefficient. The term \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in the expansion of \\( (1 + x)^k \\). Wait, but here we have \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\), so maybe combining these?

Let me write out the sum again:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\)

I need to find a closed-form expression for this sum. Let me see if I can manipulate the binomial coefficients here. There's an identity that relates \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). I remember that \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me check that.

Yes, the left-hand side is choosing \\( k \\) elements out of \\( n \\), then \\( m \\) elements out of those \\( k \\). The right-hand side is choosing \\( m \\) elements directly out of \\( n \\), then \\( k - m \\) elements out of the remaining \\( n - m \\). Since \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\), this identity holds. So substituting this into the original sum:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

We can factor out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\) since it doesn't depend on \\( k \\):

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

Now, let's make a substitution in the sum. Let \\( j = k - m \\). Then when \\( k = m \\), \\( j = 0 \\), and when \\( k = n \\), \\( j = n - m \\). So the sum becomes:

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

Factor out \\( (-1)^m \\):

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

The remaining sum is \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\), which is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\). Since \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0^{n - m} \\). But \\( n > m \\), so \\( n - m \\geq 1 \\), hence \\( 0^{n - m} = 0 \\). Therefore, the entire sum is zero.

Wait, that can't be right. If the sum is zero, then \\( S = 0 \\). But let me check this with a small example. Let's take \\( n = 2 \\), \\( m = 1 \\). Then the sum is from \\( k=1 \\) to \\( 2 \\):

For \\( k=1 \\): \\( (-1)^1 \\binom{2}{1} \\binom{1}{1} = -1 * 2 * 1 = -2 \\)

For \\( k=2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{1} = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2 \\)

Total sum: -2 + 2 = 0. Hmm, that works. Let's try another example: \\( n = 3 \\), \\( m = 1 \\).

Sum from \\( k=1 \\) to 3:

k=1: (-1)^1 * 3 * 1 = -3

k=2: (-1)^2 * 3 * 2 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3 * 1 * 3 = -3

Sum: -3 +6 -3 = 0. Also works. What about \\( n=3 \\), \\( m=2 \\):

Sum from k=2 to 3:

k=2: (-1)^2 * 3 * 1 = 3

k=3: (-1)^3 * 3 * 3 = -9

Sum: 3 -9 = -6. Wait, but according to the formula above, it should be zero. Wait, but here \\( n - m = 1 \\), so the sum would be \\( \\binom{3}{2} (-1)^2 * (1 -1)^1 = 3*1*0=0 \\). But in reality, the sum is -6. So that contradicts the previous result. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, let's check the steps again. So I started with the identity \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me verify that with n=3, m=2, k=2:

Left-hand side: \\( \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{2}{2} = 3 * 1 = 3 \\)

Right-hand side: \\( \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{1}{0} = 3 * 1 = 3 \\). So that works. For k=3:

Left-hand side: \\( \\binom{3}{3} \\binom{3}{2} = 1 * 3 = 3 \\)

Right-hand side: \\( \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{1}{1} = 3 * 1 = 3 \\). Okay, so the identity holds. Then substituting into the sum:

\\( S = \\binom{3}{2} \\sum_{k=2}^3 (-1)^k \\binom{1}{k - 2} \\)

So sum over k=2 and 3:

For k=2: (-1)^2 * \\binom{1}{0} = 1*1 =1

For k=3: (-1)^3 * \\binom{1}{1} = -1*1 = -1

Sum: 1 -1 = 0. Therefore, S = 3 * 0 = 0. But wait, when I actually computed the original sum, I got -6. So there's a contradiction here. Therefore, my reasoning must be wrong.

Wait, but in the original problem, when n=3 and m=2, the sum is:

k=2: (-1)^2 * 3 choose 2 * 2 choose 2 = 1 * 3 * 1 = 3

k=3: (-1)^3 * 3 choose 3 * 3 choose 2 = -1 * 1 * 3 = -3

Total sum: 3 -3 = 0. Wait, but earlier I thought the sum was -6. Wait, no, hold on. Let me recalculate.

Wait, in the case of n=3, m=2:

Original sum is \\( \\sum_{k=2}^{3} (-1)^k \\binom{3}{k} \\binom{k}{2} \\)

For k=2: (-1)^2 * 3 * 1 = 1 * 3 * 1 = 3

For k=3: (-1)^3 * 1 * 3 = -1 * 1 * 3 = -3

Sum: 3 -3 = 0. So actually, the sum is zero. But earlier, when I thought it was -6, I must have made a mistake. Let me check again.

Wait, if n=3, m=2, then:

\\( \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{2}{2} = 3*1=3 \\)

\\( \\binom{3}{3} \\binom{3}{2} =1*3=3 \\)

So the sum is 3 + (-1)^3*3 = 3 -3=0. So it's zero. So my initial calculation was wrong. So maybe the formula is correct.

Wait, so in this case, the substitution gives 0, which matches the original sum. So maybe the formula is correct. Let me check another example where n=4, m=2.

Original sum: k=2 to 4.

k=2: (-1)^2 * 4C2 * 2C2 =1*6*1=6

k=3: (-1)^3 *4C3*3C2=-1*4*3=-12

k=4: (-1)^4*4C4*4C2=1*1*6=6

Sum:6 -12 +6=0. Hmm, again zero. So seems like the sum is always zero when n > m. But wait, in the original problem statement, the user wrote ""for all positive integers n and m such that n > m"". So is the sum always zero?

Wait, but let's try n=1, m=0. Wait, no, m must be positive. Let's try n=5, m=3.

Sum from k=3 to 5:

k=3: (-1)^3 *5C3*3C3= -1*10*1=-10

k=4: (-1)^4*5C4*4C3=1*5*4=20

k=5: (-1)^5*5C5*5C3=-1*1*10=-10

Sum: -10 +20 -10=0. Again zero.

So it seems like the sum is always zero when n > m. Then, perhaps the answer is zero. But let me check with n=2, m=1:

Sum from k=1 to 2:

k=1: (-1)^1*2*1=-2

k=2: (-1)^2*1*2=2

Sum: -2 +2=0. Correct.

So all examples give zero. Then why does my previous step-by-step lead to a general zero?

But according to the steps, after substituting the identity, we have:

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

Which is \\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\). Since \\( n - m \\geq 1 \\), this is zero. So the entire sum is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

But wait, let me check n=1, m=0. Wait, but m must be positive. So n > m ≥1. Then n - m ≥1, so (1 -1)^{n -m}=0. Therefore, the sum is zero. Therefore, regardless of n and m (as long as n > m), the sum is zero.

Therefore, the final answer is zero.

But let me verify once more with n=4, m=1:

Sum from k=1 to 4:

k=1: (-1)^1 *4*1=-4

k=2: (-1)^2 *6*2=12

k=3: (-1)^3 *4*3=-12

k=4: (-1)^4 *1*4=4

Sum: -4 +12 -12 +4=0. Correct.

Therefore, the sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) where \\( n > m \\) are positive integers. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that binomial coefficients often come up in combinatorial problems, and sometimes generating functions or inclusion-exclusion principles can be useful. But here, there's an alternating sign \\( (-1)^k \\), which suggests that inclusion-exclusion might be involved. Let me write down the sum again:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\)

I wonder if there's a way to simplify the product of binomial coefficients \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). Let me recall the identity for multiplying binomial coefficients. There's an identity that says \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me verify that:

Yes, because choosing k elements from n and then m elements from those k is the same as first choosing m elements from n, then choosing k - m elements from the remaining n - m. So, that identity holds. Therefore, we can rewrite the sum S as:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

Since \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\) is a constant with respect to k, we can factor it out:

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

Now, let's make a substitution to simplify the sum. Let j = k - m. Then, when k = m, j = 0, and when k = n, j = n - m. So the sum becomes:

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

Factor out \\( (-1)^m \\):

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

Now, the sum \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\) is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero if \\( n - m > 0 \\). Since \\( n > m \\), \\( n - m \\) is at least 1, so this sum is zero. Therefore, the entire expression S becomes zero. 

Wait, but let me double-check. If \\( n - m = 0 \\), then the sum is just 1, but in our case, since \\( n > m \\), \\( n - m \\geq 1 \\), so the sum is indeed zero. Therefore, S = 0. 

But hold on, let me confirm this with a small example. Let's take n = 2 and m = 1. Then the sum is:

\\( \\sum_{k=1}^{2} (-1)^k \\binom{2}{k} \\binom{k}{1} \\)

Calculating each term:

For k=1: (-1)^1 * \\binom{2}{1} * \\binom{1}{1} = -1 * 2 * 1 = -2

For k=2: (-1)^2 * \\binom{2}{2} * \\binom{2}{1} = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2

Total sum: -2 + 2 = 0. Okay, that works. Another example: n=3, m=1.

Sum from k=1 to 3:

k=1: -1 * \\binom{3}{1} * \\binom{1}{1} = -3 * 1 = -3

k=2: +1 * \\binom{3}{2} * \\binom{2}{1} = 3 * 2 = 6

k=3: -1 * \\binom{3}{3} * \\binom{3}{1} = -1 * 1 * 3 = -3

Total sum: -3 + 6 -3 = 0. Yep, still zero. So seems like the answer is zero. 

But let me think again. The key step was using the identity \\( \\binom{n}{k}\\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m}\\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Is that identity correct? Let me check with numbers. Take n=3, k=2, m=1. Then LHS is \\(\\binom{3}{2}\\binom{2}{1} = 3*2=6\\). RHS is \\(\\binom{3}{1}\\binom{2}{1}=3*2=6\\). Correct. Another example: n=4, k=3, m=2. LHS: \\(\\binom{4}{3}\\binom{3}{2}=4*3=12\\). RHS: \\(\\binom{4}{2}\\binom{2}{1}=6*2=12\\). Correct again. So the identity holds. Therefore, the substitution is valid. 

Therefore, the sum S simplifies to zero because the inner sum is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. 

Wait, but let me check another example where n - m is 1. Let's take n=1, m=0. Wait, but m must be less than n, so m=0 is allowed here. Then the sum is from k=0 to 1:

k=0: (-1)^0 * \\binom{1}{0} * \\binom{0}{0} = 1*1*1=1

k=1: (-1)^1 * \\binom{1}{1} * \\binom{1}{0}= -1*1*1=-1

Sum: 1 -1 =0. So even when m=0, n=1, it's zero. But m=0 is allowed here. 

Alternatively, take n=3, m=2. Then the sum is from k=2 to 3:

k=2: (-1)^2 * \\binom{3}{2} * \\binom{2}{2} =1*3*1=3

k=3: (-1)^3 * \\binom{3}{3} * \\binom{3}{2} =-1*1*3=-3

Sum: 3 -3=0. Still zero. 

Therefore, based on these examples and the algebraic manipulation, the sum S is zero. 

But let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe using generating functions. The sum S can be considered as the coefficient extraction. Let me recall that \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the coefficient of x^k in (1 + x)^n, and \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is the coefficient of y^{k - m} in (1 + y)^k. But this seems more complicated. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions with two variables. 

Alternatively, think of the sum as the inclusion-exclusion principle. The term \\( (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\) suggests that we are subtracting and adding subsets of size k, and multiplied by \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\). Maybe interpreting this as selecting a subset of size k from n elements, then selecting m elements from those k, and alternating signs. But I'm not sure how to interpret the alternating signs here. 

Alternatively, consider the identity for finite differences. The operator \\( \\Delta f(x) = f(x + 1) - f(x) \\), and higher differences involve alternating sums. But I'm not sure if that directly applies here. 

Alternatively, maybe using generating functions for the sum. Let me consider generating functions. The generating function for \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is \\( (1 + x)^n \\), and the generating function for \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is \\( x^m (1 + x)^{k - m} \\). But combining these is tricky. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. 

Alternatively, note that \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\), which we already established. Then the sum becomes \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\). Then, as before, that inner sum is \\( (-1)^m (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero for n - m > 0. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the sum is zero. 

But let me confirm once again with another example where n - m is 2. Let n=4, m=2. Then the sum is from k=2 to 4:

k=2: (-1)^2 * \\binom{4}{2} * \\binom{2}{2} =1*6*1=6

k=3: (-1)^3 * \\binom{4}{3} * \\binom{3}{2} =-1*4*3=-12

k=4: (-1)^4 * \\binom{4}{4} * \\binom{4}{2} =1*1*6=6

Sum: 6 -12 +6 =0. Yep, still zero. 

Therefore, all these examples and the algebraic approach lead to the conclusion that the sum is zero.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) where \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) are positive integers with \\( n > m \\). Hmm, let me start by understanding what each part of this sum represents.

First, the binomial coefficients here are \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) and \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\). The term \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) looks familiar. I remember that there's an identity that connects these two binomial coefficients. Let me recall... Oh, right! The identity is \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me verify that.

Yes, if I think about choosing \\( k \\) elements out of \\( n \\), and then choosing \\( m \\) elements out of those \\( k \\), it's equivalent to first choosing \\( m \\) elements out of \\( n \\), and then choosing the remaining \\( k - m \\) elements out of the remaining \\( n - m \\). So, the identity holds. That simplifies the original sum because now I can factor out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\) since it doesn't depend on \\( k \\).

So, substituting that identity into the sum, the original expression becomes:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\).

Let me make a substitution to simplify the sum. Let \\( j = k - m \\). Then, when \\( k = m \\), \\( j = 0 \\), and when \\( k = n \\), \\( j = n - m \\). So, changing the index of summation:

\\( = \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\).

Factor out \\( (-1)^m \\):

\\( = \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\).

Now, the remaining sum is \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\). Wait, that looks like the expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\) by the binomial theorem. Right? Because \\( (1 + (-1))^{n - m} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} \\binom{n - m}{j} (-1)^j \\).

Therefore, that sum is \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0^{n - m} \\).

But \\( 0^{n - m} \\) is 0 if \\( n - m > 0 \\), which is true because \\( n > m \\). So, the entire sum becomes:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\times 0 = 0 \\).

Wait, but hold on. Let me check that again. If \\( n - m > 0 \\), then \\( 0^{n - m} = 0 \\), so the sum is zero. Therefore, the entire expression is zero. But let me verify this with some small examples to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Take \\( n = 2 \\), \\( m = 1 \\). Then the sum is from \\( k = 1 \\) to \\( 2 \\).

For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( (-1)^1 \\binom{2}{1} \\binom{1}{1} = -1 \\times 2 \\times 1 = -2 \\).

For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{1} = 1 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\).

Adding them together: -2 + 2 = 0. That matches the result.

Another example: \\( n = 3 \\), \\( m = 1 \\).

Sum from \\( k = 1 \\) to \\( 3 \\).

For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( (-1)^1 \\binom{3}{1} \\binom{1}{1} = -1 \\times 3 \\times 1 = -3 \\).

For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{2}{1} = 1 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\).

For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( (-1)^3 \\binom{3}{3} \\binom{3}{1} = -1 \\times 1 \\times 3 = -3 \\).

Sum: -3 + 6 -3 = 0. Again, zero.

How about \\( n = 3 \\), \\( m = 2 \\).

Sum from \\( k = 2 \\) to \\( 3 \\).

For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\binom{3}{2} \\binom{2}{2} = 1 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\).

For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( (-1)^3 \\binom{3}{3} \\binom{3}{2} = -1 \\times 1 \\times 3 = -3 \\).

Sum: 3 - 3 = 0. Still zero.

Hmm, seems consistent. But let me try \\( n = 1 \\), \\( m = 0 \\). Wait, but the problem states \\( m \\) is a positive integer. So \\( m \\geq 1 \\). So maybe that case isn't considered.

Wait, but even if \\( m = 0 \\), the sum would be from \\( k = 0 \\) to \\( n \\), but \\( m = 0 \\) is allowed in the identity? Wait, the problem states \\( m \\) is a positive integer. So, maybe the answer is always zero when \\( n > m \\geq 1 \\).

Alternatively, let me check another case where \\( n = 4 \\), \\( m = 2 \\).

Sum from \\( k = 2 \\) to \\( 4 \\).

For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\binom{4}{2} \\binom{2}{2} = 1 \\times 6 \\times 1 = 6 \\).

For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( (-1)^3 \\binom{4}{3} \\binom{3}{2} = -1 \\times 4 \\times 3 = -12 \\).

For \\( k = 4 \\): \\( (-1)^4 \\binom{4}{4} \\binom{4}{2} = 1 \\times 1 \\times 6 = 6 \\).

Sum: 6 -12 +6 = 0. Yep, zero.

Therefore, based on the examples and the algebraic manipulation using the binomial coefficient identity and the binomial theorem, it seems that the sum is indeed zero whenever \\( n > m \\geq 1 \\).

But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe combinatorially?

Suppose we consider the inclusion-exclusion principle. The term \\( (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) could represent something like choosing a subset of size \\( k \\) from \\( n \\), then choosing a subset of size \\( m \\) from that subset, and alternating signs. But how does that relate to inclusion-exclusion?

Alternatively, think of generating functions. The generating function for \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is \\( (1 + x)^n \\), and the generating function for \\( (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\) is \\( (1 - 1)^n = 0 \\), but here we have another binomial coefficient multiplied by \\( (-1)^k \\).

Wait, maybe consider the generating function for the entire sum. Let me try that.

The sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) can be considered as the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in the expansion of \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k \\).

Wait, because \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in \\( (1 + x)^k \\). So, the entire sum is the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k \\).

But \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k - \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k \\).

But the first sum is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k = (1 - (1 + x))^n = (-x)^n \\).

The second sum is \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k \\). However, since we're taking the coefficient of \\( x^m \\), which is in \\( (-x)^n \\), but \\( n > m \\), so \\( (-x)^n \\) has a term \\( x^n \\), whose coefficient is \\( (-1)^n \\). However, when we subtract the second sum, which is a polynomial of degree \\( (m - 1) \\), so when we take the coefficient of \\( x^m \\), only the first sum contributes. But \\( (-x)^n \\) is \\( (-1)^n x^n \\), so the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) is zero because \\( n > m \\). Therefore, the entire sum is zero.

Wait, that's another way to see it. So, regardless of the method, the sum is zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero.

But let me check with yet another example. Let's take \\( n = 5 \\), \\( m = 3 \\).

Compute the sum from \\( k = 3 \\) to \\( 5 \\):

For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( (-1)^3 \\binom{5}{3} \\binom{3}{3} = -1 \\times 10 \\times 1 = -10 \\).

For \\( k = 4 \\): \\( (-1)^4 \\binom{5}{4} \\binom{4}{3} = 1 \\times 5 \\times 4 = 20 \\).

For \\( k = 5 \\): \\( (-1)^5 \\binom{5}{5} \\binom{5}{3} = -1 \\times 1 \\times 10 = -10 \\).

Sum: -10 +20 -10 = 0. Yep, still zero.

So, after multiple examples and two different algebraic approaches (using binomial coefficient identities and generating functions), the result consistently comes out to zero. Therefore, I can confidently conclude that the sum evaluates to zero for all positive integers \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) with \\( n > m \\).

To evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) such that \\( n > m \\), we start by using the binomial coefficient identity:

\\[
\\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Substituting this into the original sum, we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

We can factor out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\):

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Next, we change the summation index by letting \\( j = k - m \\). This transforms the sum into:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

This simplifies to:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

The remaining sum is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero for \\( n - m > 0 \\). Since \\( n > m \\), this sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to zero.

Thus, the final answer is:

","Alright, let's try to figure out how to evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) where \\( n > m \\) are positive integers. Hmm, okay, so first, I need to understand what this sum is asking. It's a sum over \\( k \\) from \\( m \\) to \\( n \\) of \\( (-1)^k \\) times the product of two binomial coefficients: \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) and \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\). 

Let me start by recalling some binomial coefficient properties. The binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) represents the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) elements from \\( n \\), and \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is the number of ways to choose \\( m \\) elements from \\( k \\). So, their product \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) might have a combinatorial interpretation. Maybe there's a way to simplify this product first?

Wait, I remember that there's a identity that connects two binomial coefficients. Specifically, \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me check if that's correct. 

Yes, because if you first choose \\( m \\) elements from \\( n \\), which is \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\), and then choose \\( k - m \\) elements from the remaining \\( n - m \\), which is \\( \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\), then the total number of ways should be \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). That seems right. So, substituting this into the original sum, we can rewrite the sum as:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\).

Since \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\) is a constant with respect to \\( k \\), we can factor that out:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\).

Now, let's make a substitution to simplify the summation. Let \\( j = k - m \\). Then, when \\( k = m \\), \\( j = 0 \\), and when \\( k = n \\), \\( j = n - m \\). So the sum becomes:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\).

Which simplifies to:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\).

Hmm, the sum \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\) is a familiar one. That's the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), right? Because the binomial theorem says \\( (a + b)^d = \\sum_{j=0}^d \\binom{d}{j} a^{d - j} b^j \\). So if we set \\( a = 1 \\) and \\( b = -1 \\), then \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} \\binom{n - m}{j} (-1)^j \\).

But \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\) is \\( 0^{n - m} \\). Since \\( n > m \\), \\( n - m \\) is at least 1, so \\( 0^{n - m} = 0 \\). Therefore, the entire sum \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\) equals zero. 

Putting this back into the expression, we have:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\times 0 = 0 \\).

Wait, so does that mean the original sum is zero? That seems too straightforward, but let's verify with some small values. Let's take \\( n = 2 \\) and \\( m = 1 \\). Then the sum is:

\\( \\sum_{k=1}^{2} (-1)^k \\binom{2}{k} \\binom{k}{1} \\).

Calculating each term:

For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( (-1)^1 \\binom{2}{1} \\binom{1}{1} = -1 \\times 2 \\times 1 = -2 \\).

For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{1} = 1 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\).

Adding them up: -2 + 2 = 0. Okay, so that works.

Another test case: \\( n = 3 \\), \\( m = 1 \\). The sum is:

\\( \\sum_{k=1}^{3} (-1)^k \\binom{3}{k} \\binom{k}{1} \\).

Calculating each term:

k=1: \\( -1 \\times 3 \\times 1 = -3 \\)

k=2: \\( 1 \\times 3 \\times 2 = 6 \\)

k=3: \\( -1 \\times 1 \\times 3 = -3 \\)

Total: -3 + 6 -3 = 0. Hmm, that also works. Let me try \\( m = 2 \\), \\( n = 3 \\):

Sum is \\( \\sum_{k=2}^{3} (-1)^k \\binom{3}{k} \\binom{k}{2} \\).

k=2: \\( (-1)^2 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 1 \\times 3 \\times 1 = 3 \\)

k=3: \\( (-1)^3 \\times 1 \\times 3 = -1 \\times 1 \\times 3 = -3 \\)

Sum: 3 -3 = 0. Okay, that's also zero. So the pattern seems to hold. Therefore, the sum is indeed zero for all \\( n > m \\).

But let me check another case where \\( n - m = 1 \\), say \\( n = 2 \\), \\( m = 1 \\). As before, sum is zero. If \\( n = 4 \\), \\( m = 3 \\). Then the sum is:

\\( \\sum_{k=3}^{4} (-1)^k \\binom{4}{k} \\binom{k}{3} \\).

k=3: \\( (-1)^3 \\times 4 \\times 1 = -4 \\)

k=4: \\( (-1)^4 \\times 1 \\times 4 = 4 \\)

Sum: -4 +4 = 0. Yep, still zero. 

So all these test cases confirm that the sum is zero. Therefore, the original sum is zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero. 

But wait, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe generating functions? Let's see. The original sum is \\( \\sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). Let me see if generating functions can be applied here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the principle of inclusion-exclusion. But since the sum is zero, maybe it's a combinatorial identity that cancels out. Alternatively, we can think of generating functions. Let's see.

Consider the generating function for \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). Alternatively, note that \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\), as we did before. Then, the sum becomes \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Then, substituting \\( j = k - m \\), we get \\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\), which is \\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0 \\). So that's the same result. 

Alternatively, is there a generating function approach without using the binomial coefficient identity? Let's see. Let's consider the generating function for \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). The generating function for \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is \\( (1 + x)^n \\), and the generating function for \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is \\( x^m (1 + x)^{k - m} \\). But since \\( k \\) is involved in both, maybe not straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps using generating functions in two variables, but that might complicate things. 

Alternatively, think of the sum as \\( \\sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). Let's note that \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\), which we already used. So that's the key step. Then, the sum becomes \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\), which leads to \\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\), and since that sum is zero, the entire expression is zero. 

Therefore, all approaches lead to the conclusion that the sum is zero. So, the final answer is zero.

","Okay, let me try to figure out how to evaluate this sum: the sum from k = m to n of (-1)^k times the binomial coefficient n choose k times k choose m. So the expression is Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n,k) * C(k,m). Hmm. Alright, let's break this down.

First, I remember that binomial coefficients have some properties. Maybe I can manipulate the terms here. Let's see. The sum starts at k = m, which is important because if k were less than m, then C(k,m) would be zero. So the sum is effectively from k = m to n. That's good.

Let me recall that C(n,k) * C(k,m) is equal to C(n,m) * C(n - m, k - m). Wait, is that right? Let me check. If I have n choose k multiplied by k choose m, is there a way to combine these? Yes, using the identity C(n,k)*C(k,m) = C(n,m)*C(n - m, k - m). Let me verify this with a small example. Let n = 5, k = 3, m = 2. Then C(5,3)*C(3,2) = 10*3 = 30. On the other side, C(5,2)*C(3,1) = 10*3 = 30. Yeah, that works. So this identity seems correct. So maybe I can use this here.

So substituting that into the original sum, the expression becomes C(n,m) * Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n - m, k - m). Let's write that out:

Sum = C(n,m) * Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n - m, k - m).

Now, let's make a substitution. Let j = k - m. Then when k = m, j = 0, and when k = n, j = n - m. So the sum becomes:

Sum = C(n,m) * Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} * C(n - m, j).

Factor out (-1)^m:

Sum = C(n,m) * (-1)^m * Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j).

Now, the sum Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j) is the binomial expansion of (1 - 1)^{n - m}, which is (0)^{n - m}. But wait, if n - m > 0, then this sum is zero. However, if n - m = 0, which would mean n = m, then the sum would be (-1)^0 * C(0,0) = 1. But in the problem statement, n > m, so n - m > 0. Therefore, the entire sum Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j) is zero. Therefore, the entire expression becomes C(n,m) * (-1)^m * 0 = 0.

Wait, but let me check this again. If n > m, then n - m ≥ 1, so (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0^{n - m} = 0. Therefore, the sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to zero. Is that correct?

But let me test this with a small example. Let's take n = 3, m = 1. Then the sum is from k=1 to 3 of (-1)^k * C(3,k) * C(k,1).

Compute each term:

For k=1: (-1)^1 * C(3,1)*C(1,1) = -1 * 3 * 1 = -3.

For k=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*C(2,1) = 1 * 3 * 2 = 6.

For k=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*C(3,1) = -1 * 1 * 3 = -3.

Adding them up: -3 + 6 -3 = 0. So it works here.

Another example: n=4, m=2. Then the sum is from k=2 to 4:

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(4,2)*C(2,2) = 1 * 6 * 1 = 6.

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(4,3)*C(3,2) = -1 * 4 * 3 = -12.

k=4: (-1)^4 * C(4,4)*C(4,2) = 1 * 1 * 6 = 6.

Sum: 6 -12 +6 = 0. Hmm, again zero. So that seems to hold.

Wait, but let's check another case where n - m is 1. Let's take n=2, m=1. Then sum from k=1 to 2:

k=1: (-1)^1 * C(2,1)*C(1,1) = -1*2*1 = -2.

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(2,2)*C(2,1) = 1*1*2 = 2.

Sum: -2 +2 = 0. Yep, still zero.

But let's check when n = m + 1. So n = m +1. Let's take m=1, n=2. Wait, that's the previous example.

Alternatively, take m=2, n=3. Wait, n=3, m=2. Then sum from k=2 to 3:

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*C(2,2) = 1 * 3 * 1 = 3.

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*C(3,2) = -1 * 1 * 3 = -3.

Sum: 3 -3 = 0. Yep.

So in all these cases, the sum is zero. Therefore, it seems that the answer is zero.

But wait, let's see if there's another approach. Suppose I consider generating functions. Let me think.

The sum is Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n,k) C(k,m). Let me write this as C(n,k) C(k,m) = C(n,m) C(n - m, k - m), as before. So substituting that in, we get C(n,m) Σ_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n - m, k - m). Then changing variables to j = k - m, as before, gives C(n,m) (-1)^m Σ_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j C(n - m, j). The sum is the expansion of (1 - 1)^{n - m} which is zero when n - m > 0. Therefore, the sum is zero.

Alternatively, maybe using inclusion-exclusion principle. But perhaps the initial approach is the most straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation. Let's see. The term C(n,k) C(k,m) is the number of ways to choose a subset of size k from n elements, and then choose a subset of size m from those k elements. Alternatively, this is the same as choosing a subset of size m first from the n elements, and then choosing a subset of size k - m from the remaining n - m elements. But the (-1)^k factor complicates things. Maybe inclusion-exclusion?

Alternatively, think of the sum as evaluating a generating function. Let me consider the generating function for (-1)^k C(n,k) C(k,m). Let's see. Let me fix m, then the sum over k of (-1)^k C(n,k) C(k,m). Let me think of generating functions.

First, C(k,m) is the coefficient of x^m in (1 + x)^k. So maybe:

Sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n,k) C(k,m) = Sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n,k) [x^m] (1 + x)^k.

Interchanging sum and coefficient extraction:

[x^m] Sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n,k) (1 + x)^k.

Which is [x^m] Sum_{k=m}^n C(n,k) (-1)^k (1 + x)^k.

But the sum Sum_{k} C(n,k) (-1)^k (1 + x)^k is the binomial expansion of (1 - (1 + x))^n = (-x)^n. So the sum is (-x)^n. Therefore, the coefficient of x^m in (-x)^n is:

If m = n, then coefficient is (-1)^n.

If m ≠ n, then coefficient is zero.

But in our case, the original sum is from k = m to n, but in the generating function approach, we have considered the entire sum from k=0 to n, but with the C(k,m) term. Wait, but since C(k,m) is zero when k < m, the sum from k=0 to n is the same as from k=m to n. So the generating function approach gives that the sum is equal to [x^m] (-x)^n. Therefore, if m = n, then it's (-1)^n, but if m < n, then it's zero. But in our problem statement, n > m, so m < n, hence the sum is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

Wait, but that seems conflicting with the previous examples where n > m and the sum was zero. But in the generating function approach, we have that the sum is zero when m < n, which matches our examples. But in the case when m = n, the sum would be (-1)^n. But since in the problem, n > m, the answer is zero.

Therefore, regardless of the method, the conclusion is that the sum is zero when n > m. So the answer should be zero.

But let me check once again with another example where n - m is greater than 1. Let's take n=4, m=1. Then the sum is from k=1 to 4:

k=1: (-1)^1 * C(4,1)*C(1,1) = -1 * 4 * 1 = -4.

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(4,2)*C(2,1) = 1 * 6 * 2 = 12.

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(4,3)*C(3,1) = -1 * 4 * 3 = -12.

k=4: (-1)^4 * C(4,4)*C(4,1) = 1 * 1 * 4 = 4.

Sum: -4 +12 -12 +4 = 0. Yep, still zero.

So all these examples confirm that the sum is zero when n > m.

Therefore, the final answer should be zero. So the sum evaluates to zero for all positive integers n and m with n > m.

To evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) such that \\( n > m \\), we start by using the binomial coefficient identity:

\\[
\\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Substituting this into the original sum, we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

We can factor out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\):

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Next, we change the summation index by letting \\( j = k - m \\). This transforms the sum into:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

This simplifies to:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

The remaining sum is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero for \\( n - m > 0 \\). Since \\( n > m \\), this sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to zero.

Thus, the final answer is:

","Alright, let's try to tackle this sum: \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). Hmm, okay. So we need to evaluate this sum for positive integers n and m where n is greater than m. Hmm, let's see. 

First, I remember that binomial coefficients can often be manipulated using combinatorial identities. Maybe there's a way to simplify this expression. Let me write down the sum again:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\)

I know that \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is the number of ways to choose m elements from k, and \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the number of ways to choose k elements from n. So maybe there's a combinatorial interpretation here. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for the product of binomial coefficients. I recall that \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me check that. 

Yes, that's a standard identity. The idea is that first you choose m elements out of n, and then k - m elements out of the remaining n - m. So multiplying those gives the total number of ways to choose k elements from n with a specified m elements. Therefore, the product \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) simplifies to \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\).

So substituting that into the original sum, we get:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

Since \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\) is a constant with respect to k, we can factor it out:

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

Now, let me make a substitution in the summation index. Let j = k - m. Then when k = m, j = 0, and when k = n, j = n - m. So the sum becomes:

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

Because k = j + m, so (-1)^k = (-1)^{j + m} = (-1)^j * (-1)^m. Therefore, factoring out (-1)^m:

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

Now, the sum \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\) is a standard binomial expansion. It's equal to (1 - 1)^{n - m} by the binomial theorem. Because the binomial theorem states that \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{N} \\binom{N}{j} (-1)^j = (1 - 1)^N = 0^N \\).

So, if n - m > 0, which it is since n > m, then this sum is zero. Therefore, the entire expression becomes:

\\( S = \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m * 0 = 0 \\)

Wait, so does this mean the sum is zero? That seems too straightforward. Let me verify this with a small example. Let's take n = 2 and m = 1. Then the sum is:

k runs from 1 to 2. So terms are:

For k=1: (-1)^1 * C(2,1)*C(1,1) = -1 * 2 * 1 = -2

For k=2: (-1)^2 * C(2,2)*C(2,1) = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2

Sum is -2 + 2 = 0. Okay, that works. Let's try another example: n=3, m=1.

Sum over k=1 to 3:

k=1: (-1)^1 * C(3,1)*C(1,1) = -1 * 3 * 1 = -3

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*C(2,1) = 1 * 3 * 2 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*C(3,1) = -1 * 1 * 3 = -3

Sum: -3 + 6 -3 = 0. Hmm, still zero. Let's try m=2 and n=3.

Sum over k=2 to 3:

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*C(2,2) = 1 * 3 * 1 = 3

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*C(3,2) = -1 * 1 * 3 = -3

Sum: 3 -3 = 0. Okay, still zero. Seems like the identity holds. But wait, is this always the case? Let me check n=4, m=2.

Sum over k=2 to 4:

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(4,2)*C(2,2) = 1 * 6 * 1 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(4,3)*C(3,2) = -1 * 4 * 3 = -12

k=4: (-1)^4 * C(4,4)*C(4,2) = 1 * 1 * 6 = 6

Sum: 6 -12 +6 = 0. Yep, still zero. So maybe the sum is always zero when n > m. But why?

Looking back at the algebra, we transformed the sum into a binomial expansion which is (1 -1)^{n - m} = 0^{n - m}, which is zero when n - m > 0. Since n > m, this is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire sum S is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

But let me check another way. Maybe using generating functions. Let's consider the generating function for the binomial coefficients. The sum S can be written as:

\\( S = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\)

We can think of this as the coefficient of x^m in the generating function:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} x^m \\binom{k}{m} \\)

Wait, but maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, since we already have the identity that the product of binomial coefficients equals \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\), and then the sum over k reduces to the binomial expansion which cancels out. 

Alternatively, perhaps there's an inclusion-exclusion interpretation. Let me think. Suppose we are trying to count the number of subsets with certain properties, and the inclusion-exclusion principle gives us alternating sums. But in this case, the sum S is similar to inclusion-exclusion but with binomial coefficients. However, since the inclusion-exclusion sum here ends up being zero, maybe there's a cancellation happening.

Alternatively, perhaps using the principle of Möbius inversion. But given that we already have an algebraic proof that the sum is zero, and verified with examples, perhaps it's safe to conclude that the sum is zero whenever n > m. 

Wait, but what if n = m? Then the sum would be from k = m to n = m, so only one term: (-1)^m * C(n, m) * C(m, m) = (-1)^m * C(n, m). Since n = m, this is (-1)^m * 1. But in our case, n > m, so that case isn't considered here. 

Therefore, after all these checks and algebra, the sum evaluates to zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) where \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) are positive integers with \\( n > m \\). Hmm, let's see. I remember that binomial coefficients often have identities or generating functions that can simplify such sums. Let me start by recalling some binomial coefficient properties.

First, the term \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). Maybe I can simplify this product. I know that \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me verify that. 

Yes, because choosing \\( k \\) elements out of \\( n \\) and then \\( m \\) out of those \\( k \\) is the same as first choosing \\( m \\) elements out of \\( n \\), and then choosing the remaining \\( k - m \\) elements out of the remaining \\( n - m \\). So, that identity holds. So, substituting that into the original sum, we get:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

Since \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\) is a constant with respect to \\( k \\), I can factor that out:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\)

Now, changing the summation index. Let me set \\( j = k - m \\). Then when \\( k = m \\), \\( j = 0 \\), and when \\( k = n \\), \\( j = n - m \\). So the sum becomes:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

Which simplifies to:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\)

Now, the sum \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\) is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\). Because \\( (1 + (-1))^{n - m} = \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} \\binom{n - m}{j} (-1)^j \\). So that sum is equal to \\( 0^{n - m} \\).

But wait, \\( 0^{n - m} \\) is 0 if \\( n - m > 0 \\), which is true here because \\( n > m \\). So the entire sum becomes \\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\times 0 = 0 \\). Therefore, the original sum is zero?

Wait, but let me double-check that. Let me test with some small values. Let's take \\( n = 2 \\), \\( m = 1 \\). Then the sum is from \\( k=1 \\) to \\( 2 \\):

For \\( k=1 \\): \\( (-1)^1 \\binom{2}{1} \\binom{1}{1} = -2 \\times 1 = -2 \\)

For \\( k=2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\binom{2}{2} \\binom{2}{1} = 1 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\)

Total sum: -2 + 2 = 0. Okay, that works.

Another test: \\( n = 3 \\), \\( m = 1 \\). Sum from \\( k=1 \\) to 3.

k=1: (-1)^1 * C(3,1)*C(1,1) = -3*1 = -3

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*C(2,1) = 1*3*2 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*C(3,1) = -1*1*3 = -3

Total: -3 +6 -3 = 0. Hmm, still zero.

Wait, another test: n=3, m=2. Then sum from k=2 to 3.

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*C(2,2) = 1*3*1=3

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*C(3,2) = -1*1*3=-3

Total sum: 3 -3 = 0. Again zero. So maybe this is a general result.

But let me try n=4, m=2.

Sum from k=2 to 4:

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(4,2)*C(2,2) = 1*6*1=6

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(4,3)*C(3,2) = -1*4*3=-12

k=4: (-1)^4 * C(4,4)*C(4,2) = 1*1*6=6

Sum: 6 -12 +6 =0. So again zero. Hmm. So seems like the sum is always zero when n > m.

But according to the previous derivation, that's because the sum over j is zero. So the answer is zero. But wait, let me check another way. Maybe via generating functions.

Alternatively, consider generating functions. The original sum is \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). Let me write it as:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) (since binom(k,m)=0 when k < m)

Then, exchanging the order of summation:

\\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{k} \\binom{k - \\ell}{m - 1} } \\) Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, using generating functions.

Alternatively, note that \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\) is the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in \\( (1 + x)^k \\). So maybe we can write:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} [x^m] (1 + x)^k \\)

Then swap sum and coefficient operator:

\\( [x^m] \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} (1 + x)^k \\)

The sum is \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} (-1)^k (1 + x)^k = \\sum_{k=m}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} [ - (1 + x) ]^k \\)

Which is the same as \\( \\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} [ - (1 + x) ]^k - \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\binom{n}{k} [ - (1 + x) ]^k \\)

The first sum is \\( (1 - (1 + x))^n = (-x)^n \\), and the second sum is the tail. So:

\\( (-x)^n - \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\binom{n}{k} (-1 - x)^k \\)

Therefore, the original expression is the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in this expression.

So, \\( [x^m] [ (-x)^n - \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\binom{n}{k} (-1 - x)^k ] \\)

Let's compute each part:

First term: \\( [x^m] (-x)^n \\). If \\( n > m \\), this is zero unless \\( n = m \\), but since \\( n > m \\), this term is zero.

Second term: \\( - [x^m] \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\binom{n}{k} (-1 - x)^k \\)

Let me compute \\( [x^m] \\sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} \\binom{n}{k} (-1 - x)^k \\). Each term in the sum is \\( \\binom{n}{k} (-1 - x)^k \\), and the coefficient of \\( x^m \\) in each term is zero because \\( k \\leq m - 1 \\), so the maximum degree of x in each term is \\( k \\), which is less than m. Therefore, the entire sum contributes zero. Therefore, the second term is zero. Therefore, the entire expression is zero. So, the coefficient is zero. Therefore, the original sum is zero.

Alternatively, another approach: using inclusion-exclusion. But maybe the first method is sufficient.

Alternatively, think combinatorially. The sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) can be interpreted as inclusion-exclusion over subsets. But I'm not sure. Let me think.

Suppose we want to count the number of subsets of {1, ..., n} that have at least m elements, but with some inclusion-exclusion signs. Wait, but the signs are alternating, so perhaps it's counting with inclusion-exclusion the number of subsets that have exactly m elements? Wait, not sure. Alternatively, maybe the sum is zero because it's an alternating sum that cancels out.

But given that all test cases worked and the algebraic manipulation leads to zero, I think the answer is zero. So the final answer is zero, boxed.

\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Next, we change the summation index by letting \\( j = k - m \\). This transforms the sum into:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

This simplifies to:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

The remaining sum is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero for \\( n - m > 0 \\). Since \\( n > m \\), this sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to zero.

Thus, the final answer is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the sum S = ∑_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n,k) * C(k,m), where n > m are positive integers. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this. 

First, I remember that binomial coefficients can sometimes be manipulated using identities. Let me recall some relevant binomial identities. One that comes to mind is the identity involving the product of two binomial coefficients. Specifically, C(n,k) * C(k,m) is equal to C(n,m) * C(n - m, k - m). Wait, is that right? Let me verify.

Yes, the identity is: C(n,k) * C(k,m) = C(n,m) * C(n - m, k - m). That's because choosing k elements from n, then m elements from those k is the same as first choosing m elements from n, then choosing the remaining k - m elements from the remaining n - m. So that identity should hold. Let me check with a small example. Suppose n=5, k=3, m=2. Then C(5,3)*C(3,2) = 10 * 3 = 30. On the other side, C(5,2)*C(3,1) = 10 * 3 = 30. Yep, that works. So the identity seems correct.

So if I apply this identity to the original sum, the sum becomes:

S = ∑_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n,m) * C(n - m, k - m).

Since C(n,m) doesn't depend on k, I can factor it out of the sum:

S = C(n,m) * ∑_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n - m, k - m).

Now, let's adjust the summation index. Let j = k - m. Then when k = m, j = 0, and when k = n, j = n - m. So the sum becomes:

S = C(n,m) * ∑_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} * C(n - m, j).

Which simplifies to:

S = C(n,m) * (-1)^m * ∑_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j).

The sum here is a standard binomial expansion. Remember that ∑_{j=0}^{N} (-1)^j * C(N,j) = (1 - 1)^N = 0^N. Which is 0 if N > 0 and 1 if N = 0. 

In our case, N = n - m. Since n > m, N is at least 1 (since n and m are positive integers with n > m). Therefore, the sum ∑_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j) = 0. Therefore, S = C(n,m) * (-1)^m * 0 = 0.

Wait, so the entire sum is zero? Let me check with an example. Let's take n=2, m=1. Then the original sum is:

k=1: (-1)^1 * C(2,1) * C(1,1) = -1 * 2 * 1 = -2

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(2,2) * C(2,1) = 1 * 1 * 2 = 2

Sum: -2 + 2 = 0. Okay, that works. Let's try n=3, m=1:

k=1: (-1)^1 * C(3,1)*C(1,1) = -3*1 = -3

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*C(2,1) = 3*2 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*C(3,1) = -1*3 = -3

Sum: -3 +6 -3 = 0. Hmm, still zero. How about n=3, m=2:

k=2: (-1)^2*C(3,2)*C(2,2) = 3*1 = 3

k=3: (-1)^3*C(3,3)*C(3,2) = -1*3 = -3

Sum: 3 -3 = 0. Yep, works again. Another example: n=4, m=2.

k=2: (-1)^2*C(4,2)*C(2,2) = 6*1 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3*C(4,3)*C(3,2) = -4*3 = -12

k=4: (-1)^4*C(4,4)*C(4,2) = 1*6 = 6

Sum: 6 -12 +6 = 0. Still zero. Hmm, seems consistent.

Therefore, according to the identity and the examples, the sum is zero. But let me think again if there's any case where this might not hold. Suppose m=0? Wait, but the problem states m is a positive integer, so m ≥1. So n > m ≥1.

Wait, but what if n = m +1? Let's test n=1, m=0. But m must be positive, so not allowed. Let's take n=2, m=1 as before. The sum is zero. If n=1, m=0, but m is positive, so not in the problem's scope.

Another angle: perhaps using generating functions. Let's see. The generating function for the binomial coefficients C(n,k) is (1 + x)^n. But the sum involves (-1)^k * C(n,k) * C(k,m). Let me see if I can express this as a coefficient in a product.

Alternatively, note that C(k,m) is the coefficient of x^m in (1 + x)^k. So the sum S can be written as the sum over k from m to n of (-1)^k * C(n,k) * [x^m] (1 + x)^k.

Interchanging sum and coefficient extraction (if allowed), we get [x^m] ∑_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n,k) * (1 + x)^k.

But the sum ∑_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n,k) * (1 + x)^k is equal to ∑_{k=0}^n (-1)^k * C(n,k) * (1 + x)^k - ∑_{k=0}^{m-1} (-1)^k * C(n,k) * (1 + x)^k.

But the first sum is ∑_{k=0}^n (-1)^k * C(n,k) * (1 + x)^k = (1 - (1 + x))^n = (-x)^n.

The second sum is ∑_{k=0}^{m-1} (-1)^k * C(n,k) * (1 + x)^k. However, unless m-1 = n, which it's not since n > m, so the second sum is just part of the expansion. However, since we are taking the coefficient of x^m in the difference, perhaps there's a way to relate this.

But this seems complicated. Alternatively, since we already have an identity approach that gives zero, and the examples check out, maybe the answer is zero. But let me check another example where n=4, m=1.

Original sum:

k=1: (-1)^1*C(4,1)*C(1,1) = -4*1 = -4

k=2: (-1)^2*C(4,2)*C(2,1) = 6*2 = 12

k=3: (-1)^3*C(4,3)*C(3,1) = -4*3 = -12

k=4: (-1)^4*C(4,4)*C(4,1) = 1*4 = 4

Sum: -4 +12 -12 +4 = 0. Yep, still zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a generating function approach. Let me think. Let's consider the generating function for the sum S. Let me define the generating function G(x) = ∑_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n,k) * C(k,m) * x^k. Then evaluating S is G(1). But perhaps we can find a closed-form for G(x) and then substitute x=1.

But using the identity again, C(n,k)*C(k,m) = C(n,m)*C(n - m, k - m). So G(x) = C(n,m) * ∑_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n - m, k - m) * x^k.

Let j = k - m, so G(x) = C(n,m) * ∑_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} * C(n - m, j) * x^{j + m}.

Which is C(n,m) * (-1)^m * x^m * ∑_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j) * x^j.

The sum is ∑_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j) * x^j = (1 - x)^{n - m} by the binomial theorem. Therefore, G(x) = C(n,m) * (-1)^m * x^m * (1 - x)^{n - m}.

Therefore, evaluating at x=1, G(1) = C(n,m) * (-1)^m * 1^m * (1 - 1)^{n - m} = C(n,m) * (-1)^m * 0^{n - m}.

But since n > m, n - m ≥1, so 0^{n - m} =0. Therefore, G(1) =0. Hence, the sum S is zero. So this confirms the result again.

Therefore, regardless of the approach—using binomial identities directly or generating functions—the sum evaluates to zero. The examples also support this conclusion. Therefore, the answer should be zero.

To evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) such that \\( n > m \\), we start by using the binomial coefficient identity:

\\[
\\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Substituting this into the original sum, we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

We can factor out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\):

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Next, we change the summation index by letting \\( j = k - m \\). This transforms the sum into:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

This simplifies to:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

The remaining sum is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero for \\( n - m > 0 \\). Since \\( n > m \\), this sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to zero.

Thus, the final answer is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate this sum: the sum from k equals m to n of (-1)^k times the binomial coefficient n choose k times k choose m. And n and m are positive integers with n greater than m. Hmm, let's see. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me write down the sum again to make sure I have it right:

S = sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) * C(k, m)

where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient ""n choose k"". So, the problem is asking for the value of this sum when n > m. Hmm. Let me think about possible approaches.

I remember that binomial coefficients often have identities that can simplify sums like this. Maybe generating functions could help here? Or perhaps there's a combinatorial interpretation. Alternatively, maybe inclusion-exclusion principle? Let me try to recall some relevant identities.

First, the binomial coefficient C(n, k) * C(k, m) can be rewritten. Let me see: C(n, k) * C(k, m) is equal to C(n, m) * C(n - m, k - m). Wait, is that right? Let me check. If I first choose m elements out of n, then choose k - m elements out of the remaining n - m, that should be the same as first choosing k elements out of n and then choosing m elements out of those k. So yes, C(n, k)*C(k, m) = C(n, m)*C(n - m, k - m). That's a useful identity. So maybe I can use that here.

So substituting that into the sum, we get:

S = sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, m) * C(n - m, k - m)

Then, since C(n, m) is a constant with respect to k, we can factor that out:

S = C(n, m) * sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n - m, k - m)

Now, let's change the index of summation. Let j = k - m. Then when k = m, j = 0, and when k = n, j = n - m. So the sum becomes:

sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} * C(n - m, j)

Which simplifies to:

(-1)^m * sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j)

But the sum here is the binomial expansion of (1 - 1)^{n - m}, right? Because sum_{j=0}^m C(m, j) * (-1)^j * x^j = (1 - x)^m. So if we set x = 1, then the sum becomes (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0^{n - m}.

But wait, 0^{n - m} is 0 when n - m > 0, which is true here because n > m. So the entire sum becomes 0. Therefore, S = C(n, m) * (-1)^m * 0 = 0.

Wait, so does that mean the entire sum is zero? But let me check if I applied the identity correctly. Let me verify each step.

First, the identity C(n, k)*C(k, m) = C(n, m)*C(n - m, k - m). Yes, that's correct. It's a standard combinatorial identity where you first choose m elements out of n, then k - m out of the remaining n - m, which is equivalent to first choosing k elements out of n and then m out of those k. So that step is okay.

Then changing the index of summation from k to j = k - m is also correct. The limits change accordingly: when k = m, j = 0; when k = n, j = n - m. So the sum becomes from j = 0 to j = n - m. Then factoring out (-1)^m and C(n, m) is okay because they are constants with respect to j.

Then the sum sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j) is indeed (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0^{n - m}, which is 0 when n - m > 0. Since n > m, n - m is a positive integer, so 0^{n - m} is 0. Therefore, the entire expression is zero. So S = 0.

But wait, let me test this with some small values to make sure. Let's take n = 2 and m = 1. Then the sum is from k = 1 to 2 of (-1)^k * C(2, k) * C(k, 1).

Calculating each term:

For k = 1: (-1)^1 * C(2,1)*C(1,1) = (-1)*2*1 = -2

For k = 2: (-1)^2 * C(2,2)*C(2,1) = (1)*1*2 = 2

Sum is -2 + 2 = 0. Okay, works here.

Another example: n = 3, m = 1. Sum from k=1 to 3.

k=1: (-1)^1*C(3,1)*C(1,1) = -3*1 = -3

k=2: (-1)^2*C(3,2)*C(2,1) = 3*2 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3*C(3,3)*C(3,1) = -1*3 = -3

Sum: -3 + 6 -3 = 0. Hmm, still zero.

Another example: n = 4, m = 2. Sum from k=2 to 4.

k=2: (-1)^2*C(4,2)*C(2,2) = 1*6*1 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3*C(4,3)*C(3,2) = -4*3 = -12

k=4: (-1)^4*C(4,4)*C(4,2) = 1*1*6 = 6

Sum: 6 -12 +6 = 0. Hmm, again zero. Seems like it's working. So perhaps the general formula is zero.

But let me try another one where maybe the result is not zero. Wait, according to the identity we derived, it should always be zero when n > m. Let me try m = n -1. Let n=3, m=2. Then sum from k=2 to 3.

k=2: (-1)^2*C(3,2)*C(2,2) = 1*3*1 = 3

k=3: (-1)^3*C(3,3)*C(3,2) = -1*1*3 = -3

Sum: 3 -3 = 0. Still zero. Okay.

But wait, what if m = n? But the problem states n > m, so m cannot be n. So maybe in all cases where n > m, the sum is zero.

But let me check for n=1 and m=0. Wait, m must be a positive integer, so m=0 is not allowed here. So the problem specifies positive integers n and m with n > m, so m is at least 1. Therefore, according to the identity and the examples, the sum is zero.

But wait, let me think again. The identity we used was C(n, k)*C(k, m) = C(n, m)*C(n - m, k - m). Is that always true? Let me confirm.

Yes, this is the identity for the binomial coefficients: the number of ways to choose k elements from n and then m elements from those k is equal to the number of ways to first choose m elements from n and then k - m elements from the remaining n - m. So that identity is correct.

Therefore, the steps are valid, leading to the conclusion that the sum is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. Let me try using generating functions.

The original sum is S = sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) * C(k, m). Let's think of C(k, m) as the coefficient of x^m in (1 + x)^k. Then, perhaps we can express the sum as the coefficient of x^m in sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) * (1 + x)^k.

So, S is the coefficient of x^m in sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) * (1 + x)^k. Let's see:

sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) * (1 + x)^k = sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) * (1 + x)^k - sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^k * C(n, k) * (1 + x)^k

But the first sum is sum_{k=0}^n C(n, k) * (-1)^k * (1 + x)^k = [1 + (-1)(1 + x)]^n = [1 - (1 + x)]^n = (-x)^n.

The second sum is sum_{k=0}^{m - 1} (-1)^k * C(n, k) * (1 + x)^k. But we can write this as the sum from k=0 to m - 1 of C(n, k) * (- (1 + x))^k. However, since we need the coefficient of x^m in the entire expression, and the second sum only goes up to k = m - 1, the coefficient of x^m in the second sum would be zero because there are no terms with x^m in the sum from k=0 to m - 1. Therefore, the coefficient of x^m in the original expression is the coefficient of x^m in (-x)^n.

But (-x)^n is (-1)^n x^n. So the coefficient of x^m in this is zero unless n = m. But since n > m, the coefficient is zero. Therefore, S = 0. So this confirms the previous result.

Therefore, both methods lead to the conclusion that the sum is zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero.

But let me check with another approach, maybe using inclusion-exclusion.

Alternatively, think of the sum as sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, k) * C(k, m). Let's interpret this combinatorially. Suppose we have a set of n elements. We want to count the number of ways to choose a subset of k elements, then choose a subset of m elements from those k, with a sign of (-1)^k. So the sum is like an inclusion-exclusion count.

But how can we interpret this? Maybe it's counting something with inclusion-exclusion, but the presence of (-1)^k complicates things. Alternatively, maybe the sum can be thought of as the inclusion-exclusion principle applied to some set.

Alternatively, consider generating functions. If we consider that C(k, m) is the number of ways to choose m elements from k, then perhaps we can model this as follows: imagine that we have n elements, and we want to count the number of ways to choose a subset of size k, then choose a subset of size m from that, but with inclusion-exclusion signs. Wait, but how does that relate to something?

Alternatively, think of the sum as the coefficient of x^m in the generating function sum_{k=0}^n (-1)^k C(n, k) (1 + x)^k. Which, as we saw earlier, is (-x)^n. Therefore, the coefficient of x^m is zero unless m = n, but m < n, so zero. Therefore, this gives the same result.

Alternatively, maybe using calculus or differentiation, but that might complicate things.

Alternatively, use induction. Let's suppose that for all n > m, the sum is zero. Let's test base cases. For n = m + 1, the sum would be from k = m to m + 1. Let's compute:

For k = m: (-1)^m C(m + 1, m) C(m, m) = (-1)^m (m + 1) * 1 = (-1)^m (m + 1)

For k = m + 1: (-1)^{m + 1} C(m + 1, m + 1) C(m + 1, m) = (-1)^{m + 1} * 1 * (m + 1) = (-1)^{m + 1} (m + 1)

Sum: (-1)^m (m + 1) + (-1)^{m + 1} (m + 1) = (m + 1)[(-1)^m - (-1)^m] = 0. So yes, it works for n = m + 1.

Assume it's true for some n > m. Then consider n + 1. Hmm, but induction might be tricky here because the relationship between n and m isn't straightforward. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, use generating functions in another way. Let me think. If I set f(x) = sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n, k) C(k, m) x^k. Then evaluate f(1). But we already saw that f(1) is zero. Alternatively, use generating functions to model the problem.

But given that multiple methods lead to the conclusion that the sum is zero, and the examples confirm this, I can be confident that the sum is zero for all positive integers n and m with n > m.

Therefore, the final answer is zero.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) where \\( n > m \\) are positive integers. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this sum represents. 

First, let me parse the terms. The sum is from \\( k = m \\) to \\( n \\), and each term is \\( (-1)^k \\) multiplied by the product of two binomial coefficients: \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) and \\( \\binom{k}{m} \\). 

I remember that binomial coefficients can often be manipulated using identities. Maybe there's a way to simplify the product \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\). Let me think. 

There's an identity that says \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\). Let me verify that. 

Yes, this is a standard binomial coefficient identity. It's like choosing a subset of size \\( k \\) from \\( n \\), and then a subset of size \\( m \\) from that, which is equivalent to first choosing the \\( m \\) elements and then choosing the remaining \\( k - m \\) elements from the remaining \\( n - m \\). So, the identity holds: 

\\( \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\).

So substituting this into the original sum, we get:

\\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\).

Since \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\) is a constant with respect to \\( k \\), we can factor it out of the summation:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m} \\).

Now, let's change variables to make the summation index start at 0. Let \\( j = k - m \\). Then, when \\( k = m \\), \\( j = 0 \\), and when \\( k = n \\), \\( j = n - m \\). So, the summation becomes:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j} \\).

Simplifying the exponent on \\( (-1) \\):

\\( (-1)^{j + m} = (-1)^m (-1)^j \\).

Therefore, the sum becomes:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\).

Now, the remaining sum is \\( \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j} \\). I recognize this as the binomial expansion of \\( (1 + (-1))^{n - m} \\), which is \\( (0)^{n - m} \\). 

But \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0^{n - m} \\). Since \\( n > m \\), \\( n - m \\) is a positive integer. Therefore, \\( 0^{n - m} = 0 \\). 

Thus, the entire sum becomes:

\\( \\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\times 0 = 0 \\).

Wait, so the sum is zero? That seems too straightforward. Let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Applied the binomial coefficient identity: correct.
2. Factored out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\): correct.
3. Changed variables to \\( j = k - m \\): correct.
4. Expressed \\( (-1)^k \\) as \\( (-1)^m (-1)^j \\): correct.
5. Recognized the sum as the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\): correct.
6. Concluded that the sum is zero because \\( n - m > 0 \\): correct.

Therefore, the sum is indeed zero. But let me test this with a small example to verify.

Take \\( n = 2 \\), \\( m = 1 \\). Then the sum is:

\\( \\sum_{k=1}^{2} (-1)^k \\binom{2}{k} \\binom{k}{1} \\).

Calculating each term:

For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( (-1)^1 \\times \\binom{2}{1} \\times \\binom{1}{1} = -1 \\times 2 \\times 1 = -2 \\).

For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( (-1)^2 \\times \\binom{2}{2} \\times \\binom{2}{1} = 1 \\times 1 \\times 2 = 2 \\).

Sum: -2 + 2 = 0. Which matches the result.

Another example: \\( n = 3 \\), \\( m = 1 \\). The sum is:

\\( \\sum_{k=1}^{3} (-1)^k \\binom{3}{k} \\binom{k}{1} \\).

Calculating each term:

k=1: (-1)^1 * 3 * 1 = -3

k=2: (-1)^2 * 3 * 2 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3 * 1 * 3 = -3

Sum: -3 +6 -3 = 0. Again zero.

Another test case: n=3, m=2. Sum from k=2 to 3:

k=2: (-1)^2 * 3 * 1 = 3

k=3: (-1)^3 * 1 * 3 = -3

Sum: 3 -3 = 0. Yep.

So the pattern holds. Therefore, the sum is indeed zero for all n > m.

But wait, the problem statement says ""for all positive integers n and m such that n > m"". So the answer is zero? That seems correct based on the algebraic manipulation and the test cases.

Therefore, the final answer should be zero, which is \\boxed{0}.

To evaluate the sum \\( \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} \\) for all positive integers \\( n \\) and \\( m \\) such that \\( n > m \\), we start by using the binomial coefficient identity:

\\[
\\binom{n}{k} \\binom{k}{m} = \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Substituting this into the original sum, we get:

\\[
\\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n}{m} \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

We can factor out \\( \\binom{n}{m} \\):

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{k=m}^{n} (-1)^k \\binom{n - m}{k - m}
\\]

Next, we change the summation index by letting \\( j = k - m \\). This transforms the sum into:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

This simplifies to:

\\[
\\binom{n}{m} (-1)^m \\sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j \\binom{n - m}{j}
\\]

The remaining sum is the binomial expansion of \\( (1 - 1)^{n - m} \\), which is zero for \\( n - m > 0 \\). Since \\( n > m \\), this sum is indeed zero. Therefore, the entire expression evaluates to zero.

Thus, the final answer is:

\\[

","Okay, so I need to evaluate this sum: the sum from k equals m to n of (-1)^k times the binomial coefficient n choose k times k choose m. Hmm, let's see. All right, let's start by understanding what each part of this sum represents. 

First, the binomial coefficient n choose k is the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n. Then, k choose m is the number of ways to choose m elements from those k. So together, n choose k times k choose m would be the number of ways to first choose k elements from n, and then choose m elements from those k. But maybe there's a way to simplify this product?

Wait, there's a binomial coefficient identity that might help here. I remember that n choose k times k choose m is equal to n choose m times n - m choose k - m. Let me check that. If I have n elements, first choosing m and then choosing k - m from the remaining n - m, that should be the same as choosing k elements first and then m. But since multiplication is commutative, the order doesn't matter? Wait, actually, the identity is:

C(n, k) * C(k, m) = C(n, m) * C(n - m, k - m)

Yes, that's correct. So maybe we can use that here. Let me verify with small numbers. Suppose n = 5, k = 3, m = 2. Then C(5, 3) is 10, C(3, 2) is 3, so 10*3 = 30. On the other side, C(5, 2) is 10, and C(3, 1) is 3, so 10*3 = 30. Yep, that works. So the identity holds.

Therefore, substituting this identity into the original sum, we can rewrite the sum as:

Sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n, m) * C(n - m, k - m)

Since C(n, m) doesn't depend on k, we can factor that out of the sum:

C(n, m) * Sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k * C(n - m, k - m)

Now, let's make a substitution in the summation. Let j = k - m. When k = m, j = 0, and when k = n, j = n - m. So the sum becomes:

C(n, m) * Sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} * C(n - m, j)

Which simplifies to:

C(n, m) * (-1)^m * Sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j)

Now, the sum Sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j * C(n - m, j) is the binomial expansion of (1 - 1)^{n - m}, which is the same as evaluating the binomial theorem at x = -1. So that sum is equal to (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0^{n - m}.

But 0^{n - m} is 0 when n - m > 0, which is given because n > m. Therefore, the entire sum becomes:

C(n, m) * (-1)^m * 0 = 0

Wait, so does that mean the original sum is zero? That seems straightforward, but let me check with some examples to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Take n = 3 and m = 1. Then the sum is from k=1 to 3 of (-1)^k * C(3, k) * C(k, 1). Let's compute each term:

For k=1: (-1)^1 * C(3,1)*C(1,1) = -1 * 3 * 1 = -3

For k=2: (-1)^2 * C(3,2)*C(2,1) = 1 * 3 * 2 = 6

For k=3: (-1)^3 * C(3,3)*C(3,1) = -1 * 1 * 3 = -3

Adding them up: -3 + 6 - 3 = 0. Okay, that works.

Another example: n = 4, m = 2. The sum is from k=2 to 4 of (-1)^k * C(4, k)*C(k, 2).

Compute each term:

k=2: (-1)^2 * C(4,2)*C(2,2) = 1 * 6 * 1 = 6

k=3: (-1)^3 * C(4,3)*C(3,2) = -1 * 4 * 3 = -12

k=4: (-1)^4 * C(4,4)*C(4,2) = 1 * 1 * 6 = 6

Sum: 6 - 12 + 6 = 0. Yep, still zero.

Another test: n=2, m=1. Sum from k=1 to 2:

k=1: -1 * 2 * 1 = -2

k=2: 1 * 1 * 2 = 2

Sum: -2 + 2 = 0. Hmm, works again.

So all my test cases give zero. Therefore, the general formula seems to hold. Therefore, the sum is zero.

But let me think again why this identity works. The key step was using the binomial coefficient identity and then recognizing the binomial expansion. So by rewriting the product of binomial coefficients, we were able to factor out a term and leave a sum that's a binomial expansion of (1 - 1)^{n - m}, which is zero. Therefore, the entire expression is zero.

Is there another way to think about this? Maybe combinatorially? Let's see. The original sum is alternating in sign, with terms that count some sort of inclusion-exclusion. But perhaps it's difficult to see combinatorially. The algebraic approach seems straightforward here.

Alternatively, generating functions could be used. Let's try that. The sum Sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n, k) C(k, m). Let's consider generating functions for each term.

First, note that C(n, k) C(k, m) is the same as C(n, m) C(n - m, k - m), as before. So we have C(n, m) Sum_{k=m}^n (-1)^k C(n - m, k - m). Let me define j = k - m, so the sum is Sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^{j + m} C(n - m, j). Which is (-1)^m Sum_{j=0}^{n - m} (-1)^j C(n - m, j). The sum here is the evaluation of (1 - 1)^{n - m}, which is zero. So again, the same result.

Alternatively, think of the generating function for C(n - m, j) (-1)^j is (1 - 1)^{n - m} = 0. So that's why the sum is zero.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the sum is zero. The key insight is recognizing the binomial coefficient identity and then applying the binomial theorem to the resulting sum. Since n > m, the exponent n - m is positive, hence the sum is zero. If n = m, then the sum would be from k = m to m (only k = m), so (-1)^m C(n, m) C(m, m) = (-1)^m C(n, m). But in our case, n > m, so the sum is zero.

Therefore, after careful consideration and verification with examples, the sum evaluates to zero.

","Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the integral of (f''(x))² from 0 to 1 for functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0,1], with the boundary conditions f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. Hmm, this seems like a calculus of variations problem. Let me recall how calculus of variations works for minimizing functionals involving derivatives.

The functional here is ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. Since the integrand involves the second derivative of f, I think the Euler-Lagrange equation will be of fourth order. The standard Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional ∫ F(x, f, f', f'') dx is F_{f''}'' - F_{f'}' + F_f = 0. But in our case, there are no explicit f or f' terms in the integrand, only f''. So maybe the equation simplifies.

Wait, the integrand is F(x, f, f', f'') = (f''(x))². Then, F_{f''} is 2f''(x). Then, the Euler-Lagrange equation would be the derivative of F_{f''} with respect to x, which is 2f'''(x) = 0. Wait, but that would imply f''''(x) = 0. So integrating that, f''''(x) = 0 implies f'''(x) is constant, f''(x) is linear, f'(x) is quadratic, and f(x) is cubic. So the general solution would be a cubic polynomial.

But we have boundary conditions: f(0) = 0, f(1) = 0, and f'(0) = 2. Let me write out the cubic polynomial. Let’s assume f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. But since f(0) = 0, d = 0. Then f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx. Then f'(x) = 3ax² + 2bx + c. Given f'(0) = 2, so c = 2. Then f'(x) = 3ax² + 2bx + 2. Then f''(x) = 6ax + 2b. Then f''''(x) = 0, which is consistent with the Euler-Lagrange equation.

So our function is a cubic polynomial: f(x) = ax³ + bx² + 2x. Now, we need to apply the boundary condition f(1) = 0. Plugging x = 1 into f(x): a(1)³ + b(1)² + 2(1) = a + b + 2 = 0. So a + b = -2. So we have one equation here.

But we also need to consider the natural boundary conditions for the fourth-order Euler-Lagrange equation. Wait, when dealing with higher-order derivatives, the boundary conditions can be a bit more involved. For the Euler-Lagrange equation of fourth order, we might need to specify conditions on f, f', f'', and f''' at the endpoints. However, in our problem, the only boundary conditions given are f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. But we also need to consider what happens at x = 1 for the higher derivatives. Let me recall that in calculus of variations, when you have a functional involving higher derivatives, the natural boundary conditions are obtained by considering the variations at the endpoints. For a fourth-order equation, the natural boundary conditions would be the values of f'''(0) and f'''(1) or something like that? Wait, maybe I need to check the derivation.

Alternatively, maybe I can proceed by assuming that the function is a cubic polynomial and use the given conditions. Let's see. We have f(x) = ax³ + bx² + 2x. Then f(1) = a + b + 2 = 0 => a + b = -2. So that's one equation. But we need another condition to solve for a and b. However, in the original problem, there are only three conditions: f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2. But since the Euler-Lagrange equation is fourth order, we might need four conditions. But in our case, we have three conditions. Hmm, maybe we need to consider the natural boundary conditions as well.

Wait, perhaps the natural boundary conditions here would be that the second derivatives at the endpoints are zero? Wait, not sure. Let me think. When we do calculus of variations for functionals involving higher derivatives, the natural boundary conditions are obtained by considering the variation at the endpoints. For example, for the functional ∫ F(x, f, f') dx, the natural boundary condition is F_{f'} = 0 at the endpoints. For higher derivatives, the natural boundary conditions involve the higher derivatives of f.

In our case, the functional is ∫ (f''(x))² dx. So F = (f'')², which doesn't depend on f or f'. The Euler-Lagrange equation is F_{f''}'' - F_{f'}' + F_f = 0. But F_{f''} = 2f'', and F_{f'} = 0, F_f = 0. So the Euler-Lagrange equation is (2f'')'' = 0 => f'''' = 0. So f''(x) is linear, f'(x) is quadratic, f(x) is cubic.

But when applying boundary conditions, for the fourth-order equation, we need four conditions. However, we are given three: f(0) = 0, f(1) = 0, and f'(0) = 2. The fourth condition is missing. So perhaps the natural boundary conditions here would be f''(0) and f''(1) or something else? Wait, let me recall that in the calculus of variations, the natural boundary conditions are the ones that arise when you impose the variation to be zero at the endpoints. For a fourth-order equation, the natural boundary conditions would involve the third derivatives. Let me check.

Alternatively, perhaps since the integrand is (f'')², the natural boundary conditions would be f'''(0) = 0 and f'''(1) = 0? Wait, not sure. Let's try to derive the natural boundary conditions properly.

Suppose we consider a family of functions f(x) + εη(x), where η(x) is a test function that satisfies η(0) = η(1) = 0 (since f(0) = f(1) = 0 are fixed), but η'(0) can be non-zero. Wait, but we also have f'(0) = 2. Wait, actually, in the problem statement, the conditions are f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. So when varying the function, we need to preserve these conditions. So the variations η(x) must satisfy η(0) = η(1) = 0 and η'(0) = 0. Therefore, the natural boundary conditions would be those that are not specified in the problem. Let me think.

In the calculus of variations, the natural boundary conditions are the ones that arise when you don't have specified boundary conditions for the higher derivatives. In our case, the problem specifies f(0) = 0, f(1) = 0, and f'(0) = 2. So when performing the variation, we need η(0) = η(1) = 0 and η'(0) = 0. Then, the remaining boundary conditions would be the natural ones, which in this case might be f''(1) = 0 or something else. Wait, perhaps integrating the Euler-Lagrange equation with the given boundary conditions.

Alternatively, maybe I can proceed by assuming that the function is a cubic polynomial, as derived earlier, and then use the given conditions to solve for a and b. Wait, but we have only two equations: a + b = -2 from f(1) = 0, and f''(x) = 6ax + 2b. But we need another condition to determine a and b. However, in the calculus of variations, when you have a fourth-order equation, you need four conditions. Since we have three given (f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2), perhaps the fourth condition is natural, like f''(1) = 0? Let me check.

If we consider the natural boundary condition at x=1, perhaps it's related to the derivative of the integrand with respect to f''. The integrand is (f'')², so the derivative with respect to f'' is 2f''. Then, the natural boundary condition would be 2f''(1) = 0 => f''(1) = 0. Similarly, at x=0, since we already have f(0) = 0 and f'(0) = 2, maybe f''(0) is not specified? Wait, but f''(0) can be determined from the cubic polynomial.

Wait, let me see. If we have f(x) = ax³ + bx² + 2x, then f''(x) = 6ax + 2b. So f''(0) = 2b. If we don't have a condition on f''(0), then perhaps the natural boundary condition is f''(1) = 0. Let's assume that. Then, f''(1) = 6a + 2b = 0. So now we have two equations: a + b = -2 and 6a + 2b = 0. Let's solve these.

From the first equation: a = -2 - b. Substitute into the second equation: 6(-2 - b) + 2b = 0 => -12 -6b + 2b = 0 => -12 -4b = 0 => -4b = 12 => b = -3. Then a = -2 - (-3) = 1. So a = 1, b = -3. Therefore, the function is f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 2x. Let's check the boundary conditions: f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0. f'(x) = 3x² - 6x + 2, so f'(0) = 0 - 0 + 2 = 2. Correct. Then f''(x) = 6x - 6, so f''(1) = 6 - 6 = 0, which satisfies the natural boundary condition. So this seems to work.

Now, we can compute the integral ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. f''(x) = 6x - 6, so (f''(x))² = (6x - 6)² = 36(x - 1)². Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ 36(x - 1)² dx = 36 ∫₀¹ (x² - 2x + 1) dx = 36 [ (x³/3 - x² + x ) ] from 0 to 1.

Calculating that: At x=1, (1/3 - 1 + 1) = 1/3. At x=0, it's 0. So 36*(1/3 - 0) = 36*(1/3) = 12. So the integral is 12. Is this the minimum value?

Wait, but I need to verify if this is indeed the minimum. Since the Euler-Lagrange equation gives a necessary condition for extrema, and since the functional is convex (the integrand is (f'')², which is a positive definite quadratic form), the solution should be the global minimum. Therefore, the minimum value is 12.

But let me double-check the calculations. The function f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 2x. Let's compute f''(x):

f'(x) = 3x² - 6x + 2

f''(x) = 6x - 6

Yes, so (f''(x))² = (6x - 6)^2 = 36(x - 1)^2. Integrate from 0 to 1:

∫₀¹ 36(x - 1)^2 dx = 36 ∫₀¹ (x² - 2x + 1) dx = 36 [ (x³/3 - x² + x ) ] from 0 to 1.

At x=1: (1/3 - 1 + 1) = 1/3

At x=0: 0 - 0 + 0 = 0

So 36*(1/3) = 12. Correct.

Therefore, the minimum value of the integral is 12. Hmm, but wait, the problem statement mentions ""for functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on the interval [0, 1], satisfying the conditions f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2."" So our solution satisfies all these conditions, and the integral evaluates to 12. Therefore, the answer should be 12.

But let me consider if there could be a lower value. Suppose someone suggests a different function that is not cubic. However, since the Euler-Lagrange equation leads us to a cubic polynomial, and the functional is convex, the cubic solution should indeed give the minimum. Therefore, I think 12 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value is \\boxed{12}.

The Euler-Lagrange equation for the functional \\( \\int_0^1 (f''(x))^2 \\, dx \\) is \\( f''''(x) = 0 \\), implying \\( f(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial. 

We assume \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\). Applying the boundary conditions:
1. \\( f(0) = 0 \\) gives \\( d = 0 \\).
2. \\( f(1) = 0 \\) gives \\( a + b + c = 0 \\).
3. \\( f'(0) = 2 \\) gives \\( c = 2 \\).

The natural boundary condition \\( f''(1) = 0 \\) (derived from the variational principle) gives \\( 6a + 2b = 0 \\).

Solving these equations:
1. \\( a + b + 2 = 0 \\) implies \\( a + b = -2 \\).
2. \\( 6a + 2b = 0 \\).

Substituting \\( b = -2 - a \\) into \\( 6a + 2b = 0 \\):

\\[ 4a - 4 = 0 \\]
\\[ a = 1 \\]

Thus, the cubic polynomial is \\( f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x \\). Calculating \\( f''(x) \\):
\\[ f''(x) = 6x - 6 \\]
\\[ (f''(x))^2 = (6x - 6)^2 = 36(x - 1)^2 \\]

","Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the integral from 0 to 1 of (f''(x))² dx for functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0,1], with f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. Hmm, let's see. This sounds like a calculus of variations problem. Maybe I should recall how those work. 

In calculus of variations, to find an extremum (minimum or maximum) of a functional, we use the Euler-Lagrange equation. The functional here is the integral of (f''(x))² dx. But wait, the Euler-Lagrange equation is usually for functionals depending on f and f', but here it's depending on f''. So, how does that work?

Let me think. The general Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional J[f] = ∫ L(x, f, f', f'') dx is given by:

d²/dx² ( ∂L/∂f'' ) - d/dx ( ∂L/∂f' ) + ∂L/∂f = 0

But in our case, the Lagrangian L is (f'')², which doesn't depend on f or f'. So, ∂L/∂f = 0, ∂L/∂f' = 0, and ∂L/∂f'' = 2f''. Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation simplifies to:

d²/dx² (2f'') = 0

Which means d⁴f/dx⁴ = 0. So, the fourth derivative of f is zero. That implies that f is a cubic polynomial, because integrating four times would give a polynomial of degree at most 3.

So, f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. But since f(0) = 0, plugging x=0 gives d=0. So, f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx. Then f'(x) = 3ax² + 2bx + c, and f''(x) = 6ax + 2b.

Given the boundary conditions f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 0, let's check f(1): a(1)^3 + b(1)^2 + c(1) = a + b + c = 0. So, a + b + c = 0. Also, f'(0) = 2: c = 2. So, c = 2. Then from a + b + c = 0, substituting c=2 gives a + b = -2. So, a = -2 - b.

Now, the fourth derivative is zero, so our general solution is f(x) = ax³ + bx² + 2x. But we need to satisfy the other boundary conditions? Wait, the problem only specifies f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2. However, in the calculus of variations, when we have a functional involving higher derivatives, we need to consider natural boundary conditions. Wait, but here the problem doesn't specify any conditions on f''(0) or f''(1), right? So maybe we don't need to impose those?

But hold on, the Euler-Lagrange equation here gives us that f is a cubic polynomial, but we need to satisfy the given boundary conditions. However, since the problem only specifies f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2, perhaps we can proceed by expressing f in terms of these coefficients and then using the remaining conditions?

Wait, but if the Euler-Lagrange equation gives us that f is a cubic, then we can write f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, but with d=0, so f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx. Then, f'(0) = c = 2. So c=2. Then f(1) = a + b + c = 0, so a + b = -2. So, f(x) = ax³ + bx² + 2x, with a + b = -2. Then, f''(x) = 6ax + 2b. So, the integral we need to minimize is ∫₀¹ (6ax + 2b)² dx.

But since a and b are related by a + b = -2, we can write b = -2 - a. So substituting into f''(x), we get f''(x) = 6ax + 2(-2 - a) = 6ax - 4 - 2a. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (6ax - 4 - 2a)² dx.

Wait, but this seems a bit messy. Let me check my steps again. Maybe I made a mistake in the Euler-Lagrange equation. Let me rederive it properly.

Given the functional J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. The Euler-Lagrange equation for this is derived by considering a perturbation f + εη, where η is a function that satisfies the boundary conditions. Wait, but in this case, the perturbation η would need to satisfy η(0) = η(1) = 0, because f(0) and f(1) are fixed. But also, the derivative conditions: f'(0) = 2 is fixed, so the perturbation η'(0) = 0. However, there are no conditions on η''(0) or η''(1), so the natural boundary conditions would be that the derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to f'' evaluated at the boundaries are zero. But since the Lagrangian is (f'')², the derivative with respect to f'' is 2f''. Therefore, at the boundaries x=0 and x=1, we have 2f''(0) * η''(0) + 2f''(1) * η''(1) = 0. But since η''(0) and η''(1) are arbitrary, this implies that f''(0) = 0 and f''(1) = 0. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, in the calculus of variations, when you have higher derivatives, the natural boundary conditions are that the derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to the highest derivatives vanish at the boundaries. So, in this case, since the functional depends on f''(x), the natural boundary conditions would be that ∂L/∂f'' evaluated at x=0 and x=1 are zero. But ∂L/∂f'' = 2f'', so this gives 2f''(0) = 0 and 2f''(1) = 0. Therefore, f''(0) = 0 and f''(1) = 0. But wait, the problem didn't specify these conditions. So do we need to impose them?

But the problem only specifies f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2. So, perhaps in the calculus of variations, even though the problem doesn't specify f''(0) and f''(1), the Euler-Lagrange equation requires those to be zero? Let me confirm this.

Yes, in the calculus of variations, when you have a functional depending on higher derivatives, the extremum is found by solving the Euler-Lagrange equation and also satisfying the natural boundary conditions. In this case, since the Lagrangian is (f'')², the natural boundary conditions are f''(0) = 0 and f''(1) = 0. Therefore, even though the problem didn't specify them, we have to include them in our solution.

Therefore, our function f must satisfy f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, f''(0)=0, and f''(1)=0. Wait, but the problem only specifies f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2. So, where do these natural boundary conditions come from? Are they part of the problem's requirements, or are they derived from the calculus of variations?

In this case, since the problem is to minimize the integral of (f'')², the natural boundary conditions arise from the variational principle. Therefore, even though they weren't stated in the problem, they are necessary for the solution. So, we have to consider f''(0)=0 and f''(1)=0 as part of the constraints.

Therefore, now we have five conditions: f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, f''(0)=0, f''(1)=0. But wait, f is a cubic polynomial, which has four coefficients. So, five conditions? That seems overdetermined. Wait, let's check.

Wait, earlier I thought f(x) is a cubic polynomial, so degree 3, which has four coefficients. But if we have five conditions, that seems impossible unless some conditions are redundant.

Wait, let's recap. If the Euler-Lagrange equation gives f''''(x)=0, then f(x) is a cubic polynomial. So, f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Then f(0)=0 gives d=0. So, f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx. Then f'(0) = c = 2. So, c=2. Then f(1) = a + b + c = 0, so a + b = -2. Then f''(x) = 6ax + 2b. The natural boundary conditions are f''(0)=0 and f''(1)=0. So, f''(0) = 2b = 0 implies b=0. Then, from a + b = -2, since b=0, a = -2. Therefore, f(x) = -2x³ + 0x² + 2x = -2x³ + 2x. Then f''(x) = -12x + 0 = -12x. But wait, f''(1) = -12(1) = -12 ≠ 0. But according to the natural boundary condition, f''(1) should be zero. So, contradiction.

This suggests that the system is overdetermined, meaning there is no function f that satisfies all these conditions. But that can't be, because the problem states that such functions exist. Therefore, perhaps my assumption that the natural boundary conditions are f''(0)=0 and f''(1)=0 is incorrect here.

Wait, maybe in this problem, since we are dealing with a minimization over functions that satisfy f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2, but not specifying f'(1) or f''(0) and f''(1), the natural boundary conditions would be different. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I should approach this problem using integration by parts or another method to handle the integral of (f'')². Let's see. Let me denote f''(x) as g(x). Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ g(x)² dx. We need to minimize this integral given that f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, and f is twice continuously differentiable.

But how does g relate to f? Well, g = f''. So, integrating g once gives f'(x) = ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt + f'(0) = ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt + 2. Integrating again gives f(x) = ∫₀ˣ [∫₀ˣ g(t) dt + 2] dx = ∫₀ˣ ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt dx + 2x. Then, applying the boundary conditions f(0)=0 and f(1)=0.

So, f(1) = ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ g(t) dt dx + 2(1) = 0. Therefore, ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ g(t) dt dx = -2. Let me compute that double integral. Changing the order of integration, ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ g(t) dt dx = ∫₀¹ [∫₀¹ dt] g(t) dx = ∫₀¹ (1) g(t) dt = ∫₀¹ g(t) dt. So, ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = -2. But f'(x) = ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt + 2, so f'(1) = ∫₀¹ g(t) dt + 2 = -2 + 2 = 0. So, f'(1) = 0. Therefore, another boundary condition is f'(1) = 0, which wasn't specified in the problem, but arises from the fact that f(1) = 0.

Therefore, in addition to f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, we have f'(1)=0. Therefore, the conditions are:

1. f(0) = 0
2. f(1) = 0
3. f'(0) = 2
4. f'(1) = 0

So, these are four conditions. Since f is a cubic polynomial, which has four coefficients (a, b, c, d) but with d=0 from f(0)=0, so a, b, c. Then, f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx. Then:

1. f(0) = 0: satisfied.
2. f(1) = a + b + c = 0
3. f'(0) = c = 2
4. f'(1) = 3a + 2b + c = 0

From condition 3, c=2. Then, from condition 2, a + b = -2. From condition 4, 3a + 2b + 2 = 0 => 3a + 2b = -2.

So, we have two equations:

1. a + b = -2
2. 3a + 2b = -2

Let me solve this system. Let's solve the first equation for b: b = -2 - a. Substitute into the second equation:

3a + 2(-2 - a) = -2

3a -4 -2a = -2

a -4 = -2

a = 2

Then, b = -2 -2 = -4

Therefore, the cubic polynomial is f(x) = 2x³ -4x² + 2x.

Now, let's check the natural boundary conditions for the calculus of variations. Earlier, I thought that f''(0) and f''(1) should be zero, but let's check.

Compute f''(x): f'(x) = 6x² -8x + 2, so f''(x) = 12x -8. Then, f''(0) = -8, f''(1) = 12 -8 = 4. Neither of these are zero. But according to the natural boundary conditions derived from the variational principle, they should be zero. But in our case, they are not. So, this suggests a contradiction.

Wait, but perhaps the natural boundary conditions here are different. Let me think again. In the calculus of variations, when you have a functional that depends on higher derivatives, the natural boundary conditions are determined by the variation. Let's suppose we vary f by εη, where η satisfies η(0)=η(1)=0 and η'(0)=0 because f'(0) is fixed. Then, the first variation of the functional J is:

δJ = ∫₀¹ 2f''(x) η''(x) dx

Integrate by parts twice:

First integration by parts:

Let u = 2f''(x), dv = η''(x) dx

Then du = 2f'''(x) dx, v = η'(x)

So, δJ = [2f''(x) η'(x)]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ 2f'''(x) η'(x) dx

Second integration by parts on the remaining integral:

u = -2f'''(x), dv = η'(x) dx

Then du = -2f''''(x) dx, v = η(x)

So, δJ = [2f''(x) η'(x)]₀¹ - [ -2f'''(x) η(x) ]₀¹ + ∫₀¹ 2f''''(x) η(x) dx

But since we are looking for an extremum, the first variation must be zero for all admissible η, which leads to the Euler-Lagrange equation:

2f''''(x) = 0 => f''''(x) = 0

And the natural boundary conditions come from the boundary terms:

At x=0: 2f''(0) η'(0) - (-2f'''(0) η(0)) = 0. But η(0)=0 and η'(0)=0, so no contribution.

At x=1: 2f''(1) η'(1) - (-2f'''(1) η(1)) = 0. But η(1)=0, so only the term 2f''(1) η'(1) remains. However, η'(1) is arbitrary because η'(0)=0 but η'(1) is not necessarily zero. Wait, but η is arbitrary subject to η(0)=η(1)=0 and η'(0)=0. So, η'(1) can be any value. Therefore, to have δJ=0 for all such η, the coefficient of η'(1) must be zero, which gives 2f''(1) = 0. Similarly, at x=0, the term 2f''(0) η'(0) = 0 because η'(0)=0. So, the natural boundary conditions are f''(1) = 0. Wait, only f''(1) = 0? And f''(0) can be anything? But in our case, we have f''(1) = 4, which is not zero. Therefore, our solution f(x) = 2x³ -4x² + 2x does not satisfy the natural boundary condition f''(1)=0. Therefore, this suggests that our solution is not valid?

But wait, we derived f(x) by satisfying f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, and f'(1)=0, which are four conditions. But according to the calculus of variations, the natural boundary condition is f''(1)=0. So, why is there a discrepancy?

Ah, perhaps because in the problem, we are not only minimizing the integral but also have additional constraints: f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2. These are fixed boundary conditions, and the natural boundary condition f''(1)=0 is derived from the variational principle. Therefore, in order for the solution to satisfy all these, we need to have both f'(1)=0 (from the fixed condition) and f''(1)=0 (from the natural condition). But in our case, f'(1)=0 and f''(1)=4, which violates the natural boundary condition. Therefore, the problem is inconsistent? But the problem statement says ""functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0,1], satisfying the conditions f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2"". It does not mention f''(1)=0, so perhaps the natural boundary condition is not part of the problem's requirements. Therefore, maybe I need to ignore the natural boundary conditions and just minimize the integral given the fixed boundaries.

But that contradicts the calculus of variations, which requires natural boundary conditions when the problem doesn't specify them. So, confusion arises here. Let me check the problem statement again: it says ""functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0,1], satisfying the conditions f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2"". There's no mention of f'(1) or f''(0) or f''(1). Therefore, perhaps we are to minimize the integral without considering the natural boundary conditions, but just the fixed boundary conditions. However, according to calculus of variations, to find an extremum, we need to satisfy both the Euler-Lagrange equation and the natural boundary conditions. Therefore, there must be an error in my approach.

Wait, but the problem is to find the minimum of the integral given the fixed boundary conditions f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2. The natural boundary conditions (f''(0)=0 and f''(1)=0) are derived from the variational principle and are necessary for the solution. Therefore, the correct solution must satisfy all these conditions: f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, f''(0)=0, f''(1)=0. But earlier, when I tried to include these, the system was overdetermined.

Wait, let's try to solve it again, considering the natural boundary conditions.

So, f''(0) = 0 and f''(1) = 0. Since f is a cubic polynomial, f''(x) = 6ax + 2b. Therefore, f''(0) = 2b = 0 => b=0. Then, f''(1) = 6a + 2b = 6a = 0 => a=0. Therefore, f''(x)=0, which implies f'(x)=c, a constant. Then, f'(0)=c=2, so f'(x)=2. Therefore, f(x)=2x + d. Applying f(0)=0 gives d=0, so f(x)=2x. But then f(1)=2*1=2 ≠0. Therefore, this does not satisfy f(1)=0. Therefore, there is no cubic polynomial that satisfies f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, f''(0)=0, f''(1)=0. Therefore, this suggests that the problem as stated has no solution, which cannot be the case. Therefore, my approach must be wrong.

Alternatively, perhaps the natural boundary conditions are different. Let me recall that in some cases, for functionals involving higher derivatives, the natural boundary conditions are not just on f''(0) and f''(1), but also involve lower derivatives. Wait, let me check a reference.

In general, for a functional depending on f''(x), the Euler-Lagrange equation is f''''(x) = 0, leading to f(x) being a cubic polynomial. The natural boundary conditions are obtained by considering the variation of the functional. When we perform integration by parts, we end up with boundary terms involving f''(x) and f'''(x). For the variation to be zero for arbitrary η, these boundary terms must vanish. Therefore, the natural boundary conditions are f''(0) = 0, f''(1) = 0, f'''(0) = 0, f'''(1) = 0. Wait, but f'''(x) is a constant if f''''(x)=0, right? Because f''''(x)=0 implies f'''(x)=constant. Therefore, f'''(0) = f'''(1) = C. Therefore, the natural boundary conditions would be f''(0)=0, f''(1)=0, and C=0. But since f'''(x)=C, having C=0 would imply f''(x)=0, which as before leads to a contradiction with f(1)=0.

This suggests that there is no solution unless the problem's conditions are incompatible. But the problem states that such functions exist, so I must be missing something.

Wait, perhaps the key is that in this problem, even though we have natural boundary conditions from the variational principle, the problem only specifies certain boundary conditions, and we need to find the function that minimizes the integral under those constraints. However, in the calculus of variations, when you have fixed boundary conditions, the natural boundary conditions are automatically satisfied if the Euler-Lagrange equation is satisfied. Wait, no. The natural boundary conditions are separate from the fixed ones. If you have fixed boundary conditions, you don't impose the natural ones. Wait, this is confusing.

Let me try to approach this differently. Let's consider that the problem is to minimize the integral of (f'')² over all functions f that satisfy f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2. We don't impose any conditions on f''(0) or f''(1). So, in this case, the calculus of variations tells us to solve the Euler-Lagrange equation f''''(x)=0 with the given boundary conditions. But since the boundary conditions are f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, and no conditions on f'(1) or f''(0), f''(1), we can proceed.

Wait, but the Euler-Lagrange equation for the functional J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f'')² dx is f''''(x)=0, leading to f(x) = cubic polynomial. Then, applying the given boundary conditions:

1. f(0) = 0: d=0
2. f(1) = 0: a + b + c = 0
3. f'(0) = 2: c = 2

So, f(x) = ax³ + bx² + 2x. Then, f(1) = a + b + 2 = 0 => a + b = -2. Therefore, f(x) = ax³ + (-2 -a)x² + 2x. Then, f''(x) = 6ax + 2(-2 -a) = 6ax -4 -2a. The integral to minimize is ∫₀¹ (6ax -4 -2a)² dx.

But since a is a parameter, we can compute this integral as a function of a and find the minimum. Let's compute the integral:

I(a) = ∫₀¹ (6a x -4 -2a)^2 dx

Let me expand the integrand:

(6a x -4 -2a)^2 = (6a x -2a -4)^2 = [ (6a x -2a) -4 ]² = (6a x -2a)^2 - 8(6a x -2a)(4) + 4². Wait, no, more straightforwardly:

Let me denote u = 6a x -2a -4. Then, u² = (6a x -2a -4)^2. Let me compute this as:

= (6a x -2a)^2 - 2*(6a x -2a)*4 + 4²

= (36a² x² -24a² x +4a²) - 8*(6a x -2a) + 16

= 36a² x² -24a² x +4a² -48a x +16a +16

Now, integrate term by term from 0 to 1:

∫₀¹ 36a² x² dx = 36a² [x³/3]₀¹ = 36a² (1/3) = 12a²

∫₀¹ -24a² x dx = -24a² [x²/2]₀¹ = -24a² (1/2) = -12a²

∫₀¹ 4a² dx = 4a² [x]₀¹ = 4a² (1) = 4a²

∫₀¹ -48a x dx = -48a [x²/2]₀¹ = -48a (1/2) = -24a

∫₀¹ 16a dx = 16a [x]₀¹ = 16a (1) = 16a

∫₀¹ 16 dx = 16 [x]₀¹ = 16 (1) = 16

Adding all these up:

12a² -12a² +4a² -24a +16a +16 = (12a² -12a² +4a²) + (-24a +16a) +16 = 4a² -8a +16

Therefore, I(a) = 4a² -8a +16. To find the minimum, take derivative with respect to a:

dI/da = 8a -8 = 0 => 8a =8 => a=1

Therefore, the minimum occurs at a=1. Then, b = -2 -a = -3. Therefore, the function is f(x) = 1x³ -3x² +2x. Let's check the boundary conditions:

f(0) = 0: yes.

f(1) = 1 -3 +2 =0: yes.

f'(0) = 3*1*(0)^2 -2*3*(0) +2 =2: yes.

Now, compute the integral:

I(a=1) =4*(1)^2 -8*(1) +16=4 -8 +16=12.

But wait, according to this calculation, the minimum value is 12. However, earlier when I considered the natural boundary conditions, there was a contradiction. But here, by treating a as a parameter and minimizing I(a), we get a valid function that satisfies the given boundary conditions and yields the integral value 12.

But let's verify this function's second derivative:

f(x) = x³ -3x² +2x

f'(x) =3x² -6x +2

f''(x) =6x -6

Therefore, f''(x) =6x -6, so (f''(x))² = (6x -6)^2 =36(x -1)^2

Then, ∫₀¹ 36(x -1)^2 dx =36 ∫₀¹ (x^2 -2x +1) dx =36 [ (x^3/3 -x^2 +x ) ]₀¹ =36 [ (1/3 -1 +1) -0 ] =36*(1/3)=12. Yes, that's correct. So the minimum value is 12.

But earlier, when I considered natural boundary conditions, there was a contradiction, but here, since we didn't impose those, we got a valid solution. Therefore, perhaps the natural boundary conditions are not required here because we are only minimizing the integral under the given fixed boundary conditions, and the Euler-Lagrange equation combined with those conditions gives a valid solution. The natural boundary conditions (f''(0)=0 and f''(1)=0) are not part of the problem's constraints, so even though the calculus of variations usually requires them, in this case, since the problem doesn't specify them, we don't need to impose them. However, the solution we found does not satisfy f''(0)=0 and f''(1)=0. Specifically, f''(0)= -6 and f''(1)=0. So f''(1)=0, which coincides with the natural boundary condition, but f''(0)= -6 ≠0. Therefore, why is this possible?

Ah, because in this problem, we have a fixed boundary condition on f'(0)=2, which affects the solution. The natural boundary condition f''(1)=0 is satisfied here, but f''(0) is not zero. This is because the fixed condition on f'(0) overpowers the natural boundary condition on f''(0). Therefore, the solution is valid even though it doesn't satisfy the natural boundary condition on f''(0). This is because the fixed condition on f'(0) takes precedence.

Therefore, the minimum value of the integral is 12.

But let me check once more. The function f(x) =x³ -3x² +2x. Let's compute f''(x)=6x -6. Then, (f''(x))²=36(x -1)^2. Integrating from 0 to1 gives 36*(1/3)=12. Yes, correct.

Therefore, the answer is 12, which is \\boxed{12}.

","Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the integral of (f''(x))² from 0 to 1, where f is a twice continuously differentiable function on [0,1], with boundary conditions f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. Hmm, let's see. This seems like a calculus of variations problem. I remember that in these problems, we try to find functions that extremize a functional, which in this case is the integral of (f''(x))². 

First, I should recall the general approach. For a functional of the form ∫ L(x, f, f', f'') dx, the Euler-Lagrange equation would give the differential equation that the extremal function satisfies. But here, the functional is just ∫ (f''(x))² dx, so maybe the Euler-Lagrange equation for this specific case is straightforward. 

Wait, the standard Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional ∫ L(x, f, f', f'') dx is:

∂L/∂f - d/dx (∂L/∂f') + d²/dx² (∂L/∂f'') = 0

But in our case, L = (f'')². So let's compute the derivatives:

∂L/∂f = 0 (since L doesn't depend on f)

∂L/∂f' = 0 (since L doesn't depend on f')

∂L/∂f'' = 2f''

Then plugging into the Euler-Lagrange equation:

0 - d/dx (0) + d²/dx² (2f'') = 0

Simplifying, that's d²/dx² (2f'') = 0, so 2f'''' = 0, which implies f''''(x) = 0.

Therefore, the fourth derivative of f is zero. Integrating four times, f(x) would be a cubic polynomial. Let me check that. If f''''(x) = 0, then f'''(x) = C (constant), f''(x) = Cx + D, f'(x) = (C/2)x² + Dx + E, and f(x) = (C/6)x³ + (D/2)x² + Ex + F.

But wait, the function is cubic. However, we have boundary conditions at 0 and 1. Let's see. Let's write f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Then f(0) = 0 gives d = 0. f(1) = a + b + c + d = a + b + c = 0. f'(x) = 3ax² + 2bx + c, so f'(0) = c = 2. Then we have c = 2. So f(x) = ax³ + bx² + 2x. Then f(1) = a + b + 2 = 0, so a + b = -2. 

But we also need to satisfy the natural boundary conditions from the calculus of variations. Wait, in the standard calculus of variations with fixed boundary conditions, sometimes you have natural boundary conditions when the variations are not fixed. But in this problem, the boundary conditions are fixed: f(0) = f(1) = 0, and f'(0) = 2. Wait, but f'(1) isn't specified. Hmm. 

Wait, actually, in calculus of variations, when you have fixed boundary conditions, you don't need to worry about natural boundary conditions. But in this case, the functional is ∫ (f''(x))² dx, and the Euler-Lagrange equation gives f''''(x) = 0, so f(x) is a cubic. But we have four constants in the cubic: a, b, c, d. But from the boundary conditions, we have three conditions: f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2. That's three equations, but a cubic has four coefficients. Wait, but in our case, d=0 because f(0)=0, and then f(1)=0 gives a + b + c = 0, and f'(0)=2 gives c=2. So that's three equations: d=0, a + b + c = 0, c=2. So substituting c=2 into a + b + c = 0 gives a + b = -2. But then we still have two free variables, a and b. So how do we determine them? 

Wait, but if the Euler-Lagrange equation is satisfied by any cubic polynomial with those conditions, but in the calculus of variations, we need to extremize the functional. But if the Euler-Lagrange equation is satisfied by all cubics that satisfy the boundary conditions, then perhaps the functional is minimized by any of these cubics? But that can't be, since the integral of (f''(x))² would depend on a and b. So maybe I'm missing something here. 

Wait, perhaps there are more conditions. Let's think. Since the functional is ∫ (f''(x))² dx, and we have a cubic polynomial f(x) = ax³ + bx² + 2x. Then f''(x) = 6ax + 2b. So (f''(x))² = (6ax + 2b)². Then the integral from 0 to 1 is ∫₀¹ (6ax + 2b)² dx. Let's compute that:

∫₀¹ (36a²x² + 24abx + 4b²) dx = 36a² ∫₀¹ x² dx + 24ab ∫₀¹ x dx + 4b² ∫₀¹ dx

= 36a²*(1/3) + 24ab*(1/2) + 4b²*(1)

= 12a² + 12ab + 4b²

So the integral is 12a² + 12ab + 4b². We need to minimize this expression with the constraint that a + b = -2 (from f(1)=0). Because a + b = -2, we can express a = -2 - b. Substitute into the expression:

12(-2 - b)² + 12(-2 - b)b + 4b²

First compute (-2 - b)² = 4 + 4b + b²

So:

12(4 + 4b + b²) + 12(-2b - b²) + 4b²

= 48 + 48b + 12b² -24b -12b² +4b²

Combine like terms:

48 + (48b -24b) + (12b² -12b² +4b²)

= 48 + 24b + 4b²

So the expression simplifies to 4b² +24b +48. To find the minimum of this quadratic in b, take derivative with respect to b:

8b +24 = 0 => 8b = -24 => b = -3

Then a = -2 - (-3) = 1

Therefore, the minimal occurs at a=1, b=-3. So the function is f(x) = 1x³ -3x² +2x. Let's check if this satisfies all boundary conditions:

f(0)=0, f(1)=1 -3 +2=0, f'(0)=2. Correct.

Then f''(x)=6x + 2*(-3)=6x -6. So (f''(x))²=(6x -6)^2=36(x -1)^2. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ 36(x -1)^2 dx. Let's compute that:

36 ∫₀¹ (x² - 2x +1) dx = 36 [ (x³/3 - x² + x) ]₀¹ = 36 [ (1/3 -1 +1) -0 ] = 36*(1/3) = 12

So the minimal value is 12? Wait, but the problem says ""Find the minimum value of ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx"", and according to this, it's 12. But let me check if this is correct.

Wait, but maybe I made a mistake in the calculations. Let me verify each step.

First, f(x) is a cubic polynomial: f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Boundary conditions:

f(0) = 0 => d=0.

f(1) = a + b + c = 0.

f'(0) = 2 => c=2.

So f(x) = ax³ + bx² + 2x. Then f(1) = a + b + 2 = 0 => a + b = -2. Correct.

f''(x) = 6ax + 2b. Then (f''(x))² = (6ax + 2b)^2. Then integrating from 0 to1:

∫₀¹ (6ax + 2b)^2 dx = 12a² + 12ab +4b². Correct.

Expressed in terms of a and b, with a = -2 -b. Then substituting into the expression:

12(-2 -b)^2 +12(-2 -b)b +4b². Which simplifies to 12(4 +4b +b²) +12(-2b -b²) +4b² = 48 +48b +12b² -24b -12b² +4b² = 48 +24b +4b². Correct.

Then taking derivative: 8b +24 =0 => b=-3. Then a=1. So f(x)=x³ -3x² +2x. Then f''(x)=6x -6. Squared is 36(x-1)^2. Integral over [0,1] is 36*(1/3)=12. So the minimal value is 12. 

But wait, the problem statement mentions ""functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0,1]"". But our solution is a cubic, which is infinitely differentiable, so that's okay. So maybe 12 is the correct answer. 

But let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using integration by parts or some other method?

Alternatively, since the functional is the integral of (f'')², perhaps we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some other inequality to find the minimum. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe using the method of Lagrange multipliers for the calculus of variations. Let me try that.

We can set up the problem as minimizing ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx subject to the constraints f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2. But since the constraints are fixed, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation as before. But in the standard calculus of variations, when you have fixed boundary conditions, you don't need Lagrange multipliers. So perhaps the approach I took earlier is correct.

Alternatively, maybe there is a way to express the integral in terms of f'' and then find the minimal. For example, if we think of the integral as the squared norm of f'' in the space L²[0,1], then the minimal norm would be achieved by the orthogonal projection. But since we have boundary conditions, maybe the minimal is achieved by a certain function. But in this case, since we derived the minimal as 12, maybe that's correct.

Wait, but let me check with another approach. Suppose we let g(x) = f''(x). Then the functional becomes ∫₀¹ g(x)² dx, and we need to find the minimal under certain boundary conditions on f. But f is related to g via f'' = g. Then f' = ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt + C, and f = ∫₀ˣ ∫₀ᵗ g(s) ds dt + Cx + D. Applying boundary conditions:

f(0) = 0 => D = 0.

f'(0) = 2 => C = 2.

f(1) = 0 => ∫₀¹ ∫₀ᵗ g(s) ds dt + 2*1 = 0 => ∫₀¹ ∫₀ᵗ g(s) ds dt = -2.

So we have the problem: minimize ∫₀¹ g(x)² dx subject to ∫₀¹ ∫₀ᵗ g(s) ds dt = -2.

This is a constrained optimization problem. Let's denote the constraint as ∫₀¹ ∫₀ᵗ g(s) ds dt = -2. Let's denote F(g) = ∫₀¹ g(s)² ds and the constraint is G(g) = ∫₀¹ ∫₀ᵗ g(s) ds dt + 2 = 0.

Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we can set up the functional J(g) = F(g) + λ (G(g)) = ∫₀¹ g(s)² ds + λ ( ∫₀¹ ∫₀ᵗ g(s) ds dt + 2 )

Taking variation δg, the variation of J is:

δJ = 2 ∫₀¹ g(s) δg(s) ds + λ ∫₀¹ ∫₀ᵗ δg(s) ds dt

Integrate the second term by parts over t first:

∫₀¹ ∫₀ᵗ δg(s) ds dt = ∫₀¹ δg(s) ( ∫ₛ¹ dt ) ds = ∫₀¹ δg(s) (1 - s) ds

Therefore, δJ = 2 ∫₀¹ g(s) δg(s) ds + λ ∫₀¹ (1 - s) δg(s) ds

Setting δJ = 0 for all δg, we get:

[2g(s) + λ(1 - s)] δg(s) = 0 for all s in [0,1]

Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation is 2g(s) + λ(1 - s) = 0 => g(s) = -λ(1 - s)/2

But g(s) = f''(s), so f''(s) = -λ(1 - s)/2. Integrating once:

f'(s) = -λ/2 ∫ (1 - s) ds + C = -λ/2 (s - s²/2) + C

But we have f'(0) = 2, so when s=0:

f'(0) = -λ/2 (0 - 0) + C = C = 2 => C=2

So f'(s) = -λ/2 (s - s²/2) + 2

Integrate again to get f(s):

f(s) = -λ/2 ∫ (s - s²/2) ds + 2s + D

= -λ/2 [ s²/2 - s³/6 ] + 2s + D

Applying f(0) = 0:

f(0) = -λ/2 (0 - 0) + 0 + D = D = 0 => D=0

Then f(s) = -λ/2 (s²/2 - s³/6 ) + 2s = -λ/4 s² + λ/12 s³ + 2s

Now apply the constraint f(1) = 0:

f(1) = -λ/4 (1) + λ/12 (1) + 2(1) = (-λ/4 + λ/12 + 2) = (-λ/6 + 2) = 0

Solving for λ:

-λ/6 + 2 = 0 => λ = 12

Therefore, λ=12. Then f(s) = -12/4 s² + 12/12 s³ + 2s = -3s² + s³ + 2s = s³ -3s² +2s, which is the same cubic as before. Then f''(s) = 6s -6, so ∫₀¹ (6s -6)^2 ds = 12, as computed earlier. So this confirms the result.

Therefore, the minimal value is 12. But wait, the problem statement says ""Find the minimum value of ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx for functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0,1]... and f'(0)=2. 2/3"". Wait, is there a typo here? The original problem says ""f'(0)=2. 2/3"". Maybe that's a formatting error, and the actual condition is f'(0)=2, and the answer is 12. But 12 seems high. Let me check again.

Wait, when I calculated the integral, I got 12. Let me verify the integral computation again:

f''(x)=6x -6. Then (f''(x))²=36(x -1)^2. Integral from 0 to1 is 36 ∫₀¹ (x -1)^2 dx = 36 ∫₀¹ (1 -2x +x²) dx = 36 [x -x² +x³/3] from 0 to1 = 36 [1 -1 +1/3 -0] = 36*(1/3)=12. So yes, 12 is correct.

But the problem mentions ""functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0,1]"", which is satisfied by our cubic. So unless there's a mistake in the calculations, 12 is the answer. However, I recall that sometimes in such problems, the minimal value is achieved by a specific function, like a quadratic or something else. Wait, but in this case, the Euler-Lagrange equation gives a cubic. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, consider expanding f(x) in terms of basis functions that satisfy the boundary conditions. For example, since f(0)=f(1)=0, we can write f(x) = x(1 -x)g(x), where g(0)=g(1)=0. But not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, use Fourier series or something. But that might complicate things. 

Alternatively, think of the integral ∫ (f'')² dx as the energy of the second derivative, so the minimal energy would correspond to the function with the least ""curvature"". But with the given boundary conditions, the minimal seems to be achieved by the cubic polynomial found earlier.

Alternatively, check some references or similar problems. For example, in calculus of variations, the problem of minimizing the integral of (f'')² with fixed f(0), f(1), f'(0) is standard and leads to a cubic solution, as here. 

Therefore, after multiple approaches and checks, I think the minimal value is indeed 12. So the answer should be \\boxed{12}

","Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the integral ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx for functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0, 1], with boundary conditions f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this problem is asking. It's an optimization problem where the objective is to minimize the integral of the square of the second derivative of f. The constraints are the boundary conditions on f and its derivative at 0 and 1.

First, I recall that when you need to minimize an integral of a function involving higher derivatives, calculus of variations might be the way to go. In calculus of variations, we look for functions that extremize (minimize or maximize) a functional. Here, the functional is ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. To find the extremum, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation. But wait, the Euler-Lagrange equation is typically applied to functionals that depend on f and its first derivative. Here, the integrand is f''(x) squared, so maybe we need to adjust the Euler-Lagrange approach for higher derivatives.

Let me recall the general form of the Euler-Lagrange equation for higher-order derivatives. If the functional is ∫ L(x, f, f', f'', ..., f^{(n)}) dx, then the Euler-Lagrange equation involves the derivatives up to the nth order. But in this case, our integrand is (f''(x))², which only depends on the second derivative. So perhaps the Euler-Lagrange equation for this case is derived by considering the variations of the functional.

Alternatively, maybe we can reduce the problem by considering substitutions. Let me think. If we let g(x) = f'(x), then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (g'(x))² dx, and the boundary conditions become f(0) = 0, f(1) = 0, and g(0) = 2. But f(x) is the integral of g(x). So f(x) = ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt. Therefore, the boundary conditions f(0) = 0 is automatically satisfied, f(1) = 0 implies that ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0, and g(0) = 2. So now, the problem is to minimize ∫₀¹ (g'(x))² dx subject to ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0 and g(0) = 2. Hmm, but g(0) = 2 is a boundary condition on g, and ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0 is a constraint. So maybe this is a constrained optimization problem now.

Wait, but how do we handle the constraint ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0? Maybe using Lagrange multipliers? Let's consider the functional to minimize is ∫₀¹ (g'(x))² dx, and the constraint is ∫₀¹ g(x) dx = 0. So, the Lagrangian would be ∫₀¹ (g'(x))² dx + λ ∫₀¹ g(x) dx. Then, taking variations with respect to g, we would get the Euler-Lagrange equation for this combined functional.

But the Euler-Lagrange equation here would involve the second derivative of g. Let's compute that. The functional is ∫₀¹ (g'(x))² dx + λ ∫₀¹ g(x) dx. The integrand is L = (g')² + λ g. The Euler-Lagrange equation is d²/dx² (dL/dg') - dL/dg = 0. So, d²/dx² (2g') - λ = 0. That simplifies to 2g''(x) - λ = 0, so g''(x) = λ/2. Integrating twice, we get g'(x) = (λ/2)x + C, and g(x) = (λ/4)x² + Cx + D. But we have boundary conditions on g. Specifically, we know that g(0) = 2. Let's plug in x = 0 into g(x): g(0) = D = 2. Also, since the original problem had f(1) = 0, which translates to ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0. So, ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = ∫₀¹ [(λ/4)t² + Ct + 2] dt = 0. Let's compute that integral:

∫₀¹ (λ/4 t² + C t + 2) dt = (λ/4)(1/3) + C(1/2) + 2(1) = λ/12 + C/2 + 2 = 0.

So, λ/12 + C/2 + 2 = 0. Also, from the Euler-Lagrange equation, we had g''(x) = λ/2. But we need to determine λ and C such that the boundary conditions are satisfied. Wait, but we also have another boundary condition on g. Wait, originally, f(1) = 0 implies that ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0, which we already used. But what about the other boundary condition? The original problem had f'(1) = something? Wait, no, the original problem only specified f(0) = 0, f(1) = 0, and f'(0) = 2. There's no condition on f'(1). So, in terms of g, which is f', we have g(0) = 2, and ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0. But there is no condition on g(1). So perhaps g(1) is free? But since we're dealing with the Euler-Lagrange equation, which is 2g''(x) - λ = 0, leading to g''(x) = λ/2. So integrating twice, we get g(x) = (λ/4)x² + Cx + D. As before, D = 2. Then, g(x) = (λ/4)x² + Cx + 2. Then, the integral condition ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0 gives λ/12 + C/2 + 2 = 0. So we have one equation with two variables, λ and C. However, we need another condition to solve for λ and C. But wait, what is the other condition? The original problem doesn't specify a condition on f'(1), so maybe g(1) is free. But in the calculus of variations, when you have a free endpoint, you need to consider natural boundary conditions. Wait, but in this case, we have a constraint ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0, which is a global constraint, not a local one. Hmm, maybe the natural boundary condition here is that the variation at x=1 is zero? Wait, perhaps I need to consider the variation of the functional with the constraint.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that when we introduced the Lagrange multiplier λ for the constraint ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0, the Euler-Lagrange equation gives us g''(x) = λ/2, but we have two constants, λ and C, and one equation from the integral condition. Therefore, unless there is another boundary condition, we might have a one-parameter family of solutions. But since we need a specific solution, maybe we need to use the fact that the original problem had no condition on f'(1), so g(1) is free. Therefore, perhaps the natural boundary condition is that the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to the highest derivative is zero at the boundaries. Wait, the Lagrangian here is (g')² + λ g. The highest derivative is g', so the natural boundary condition would be that the derivative of the Lagrangian with respect to g' is zero at x=1. So, dL/dg' = 2g' = 0 at x=1. Therefore, g'(1) = 0. So, in addition to the integral condition and g(0)=2, we have g'(1)=0. Let's check that.

Wait, if the original problem didn't specify a condition on f'(1), then when we perform the variation, the boundary terms at x=1 would involve g'(1). If we don't have a condition on g'(1), then the variation must be zero there, leading to g'(1)=0. Therefore, the natural boundary condition is g'(1)=0. So now, we have three conditions:

1. g(0) = 2
2. ∫₀¹ g(t) dt = 0
3. g'(1) = 0

But let's check. The Euler-Lagrange equation is g''(x) = λ/2. So, integrating, we get g'(x) = (λ/2)x + C. Then, applying the natural boundary condition at x=1: g'(1) = (λ/2)(1) + C = 0 => λ/2 + C = 0. Also, from the integral condition: ∫₀¹ [(λ/4)x² + Cx + 2] dx = 0 => λ/12 + C/2 + 2 = 0. And from g(0)=2, which gives D=2. So, now we have two equations:

1. λ/2 + C = 0
2. λ/12 + C/2 + 2 = 0

Let me solve these equations. From equation 1: C = -λ/2. Substitute into equation 2:

λ/12 + (-λ/2)/2 + 2 = 0 => λ/12 - λ/4 + 2 = 0.

Compute λ/12 - λ/4 = (λ - 3λ)/12 = (-2λ)/12 = -λ/6. So, -λ/6 + 2 = 0 => -λ/6 = -2 => λ = 12.

Then, C = -λ/2 = -12/2 = -6.

Therefore, the function g(x) is:

g(x) = (λ/4)x² + Cx + D = (12/4)x² + (-6)x + 2 = 3x² -6x + 2.

Therefore, f(x) is the integral of g(x):

f(x) = ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt = ∫₀ˣ (3t² -6t + 2) dt = x³ -3x² + 2x + C. But since f(0) = 0, the constant is zero. So, f(x) = x³ -3x² + 2x.

But wait, let's check if this satisfies all the conditions. First, f(0) = 0. Yes. f(1) = 1 -3 + 2 = 0. Good. f'(x) = 3x² -6x + 2, so f'(0) = 0 -0 + 2 = 2. Correct. Then, f''(x) = 6x -6. Then, the integral ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx = ∫₀¹ (6x -6)^2 dx = ∫₀¹ 36(x -1)^2 dx = 36 ∫₀¹ (x² - 2x + 1) dx = 36 [ (x³/3 - x² + x ) ] from 0 to1 = 36 [ (1/3 -1 +1) - 0 ] = 36*(1/3) = 12. So the integral is 12. But is this the minimum?

Wait, but let's verify if this is indeed the minimal solution. Since we applied the Euler-Lagrange equation with the Lagrange multiplier for the constraint and the natural boundary condition, this should give the extremum. But since we are minimizing a positive definite integral, this should be the minimum. However, let's check if there are any other possible solutions or if maybe the natural boundary condition was correctly applied.

But let's think again. The original problem didn't specify a condition on f'(1), so when we converted it into a problem for g(x), we had a constraint on the integral of g and a natural boundary condition on g'(1). By using the Lagrange multiplier method with the integral constraint and the natural boundary condition, we arrived at a specific solution. Therefore, this should be the minimal solution.

But wait, let me check the calculations again. Let's compute f''(x) = 6x -6, so (f''(x))² = (6x -6)^2 = 36(x-1)^2. Then, integrating from 0 to1:

∫₀¹ 36(x-1)^2 dx = 36 ∫₀¹ (x² - 2x +1) dx = 36 [ (x³/3 - x² + x ) ] from 0 to1. At x=1: 1/3 -1 +1 = 1/3. At x=0: 0. So the integral is 36*(1/3) = 12. So yes, 12. Therefore, the minimum value is 12. But let me check if this is correct.

Wait, but let me consider another approach. Suppose we didn't use Lagrange multipliers and instead considered the problem as an optimal control problem, where we want to minimize the integral of (f''(x))² dx, with f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2. Maybe we can set up the problem using calculus of variations directly for f.

The functional to minimize is ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. The Euler-Lagrange equation for this functional would be obtained by taking variations of f. Let's consider a variation f(x) + εη(x), where η(x) is a function that satisfies η(0) = η(1) = 0 (since f(0) and f(1) are fixed) and η'(0) = 0 (since f'(0) is fixed). Wait, but actually, the boundary conditions are f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2. So, variations must satisfy δf(0) = 0, δf(1) = 0, δf'(0) = 0. Therefore, the admissible variations are functions η(x) such that η(0) = η(1) = 0 and η'(0) = 0.

Therefore, when we compute the variation of the functional, we have:

δ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx = ∫₀¹ 2f''(x) δf''(x) dx.

Integrating by parts twice:

First integration by parts:

∫₀¹ 2f''(x) δf''(x) dx = 2f''(x) δf'(x) |₀¹ - 2∫₀¹ f'''(x) δf'(x) dx.

But δf'(0) = 0 and δf'(1) is free? Wait, no, because the boundary conditions on f are f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2. So, variations must satisfy δf(0)=0, δf(1)=0, δf'(0)=0. Therefore, δf'(1) can be non-zero, but δf'(0)=0. Therefore, at x=0, the term 2f''(x) δf'(x) evaluates to 2f''(0) δf'(0) = 0. At x=1, it's 2f''(1) δf'(1). Therefore, the first integration by parts gives:

= 2f''(1) δf'(1) - 2∫₀¹ f'''(x) δf'(x) dx.

Now, integrating the second term by parts again:

∫₀¹ f'''(x) δf'(x) dx = f'''(x) δf(x) |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ f''''(x) δf(x) dx.

But δf(0) = δf(1) = 0, so the boundary terms vanish. Therefore, the variation becomes:

δ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx = 2f''(1) δf'(1) - 2 [ -∫₀¹ f''''(x) δf(x) dx ] = 2f''(1) δf'(1) + 2∫₀¹ f''''(x) δf(x) dx.

But for the functional to have an extremum, the variation must be zero for all admissible η(x). However, in our case, δf'(1) is not fixed, so we have a term involving δf'(1). To handle this, we need to consider the natural boundary condition at x=1. In the calculus of variations, if the variation at a boundary is free (not fixed), then the coefficient of δf'(1) must be zero. Therefore, setting the coefficient of δf'(1) to zero gives f''(1) = 0. Additionally, the remaining term is ∫₀¹ f''''(x) δf(x) dx = 0 for all δf(x) with δf(0)=δf(1)=δf'(0)=0. Therefore, by the fundamental lemma of calculus of variations, f''''(x) = 0 for all x in [0,1].

Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation is f''''(x) = 0. Integrating this, we get f'''(x) = C, f''(x) = Cx + D, f'(x) = (C/2)x² + Dx + E, and f(x) = (C/6)x³ + (D/2)x² + Ex + F. Applying boundary conditions:

1. f(0) = 0 => F = 0.
2. f(1) = 0 => (C/6) + (D/2) + E = 0.
3. f'(0) = 2 => E = 2.
4. f''(1) = 0 => C(1) + D = 0 => C + D = 0.

So, let's write the equations:

From f'(0) = 2: E = 2.

From f''(1) = 0: C + D = 0 => D = -C.

From f(1) = 0: (C/6) + (D/2) + E = 0. Substitute D = -C and E = 2:

(C/6) + (-C/2) + 2 = 0 => (C/6 - 3C/6) + 2 = (-2C/6) + 2 = (-C/3) + 2 = 0 => -C/3 = -2 => C = 6.

Therefore, D = -6, E = 2, and F = 0. So the function is:

f(x) = (6/6)x³ + (-6/2)x² + 2x = x³ - 3x² + 2x.

Which is the same function we found earlier! Therefore, f''(x) = 6x -6, and the integral ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx = 12. So this confirms the result.

But wait, so both methods led us to the same function and the same integral value. Therefore, the minimal value of the integral is 12. However, the problem states ""Find the minimum value... for functions f... satisfying the conditions f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2."" So, according to this, the answer is 12. But wait, the initial problem statement had a typo? The user wrote ""Find the minimum value of ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx for functions f... and f'(0) = 2.\\frac{2}{3}$"" The last part seems to be a LaTeX error. Probably, it was supposed to be ""and f'(0) = 2."" So, assuming that, our answer is 12. But let me check again.

Wait, but according to the problem statement, the user wrote ""Find the minimum value... for functions f... satisfying the conditions f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2.\\frac{2}{3}$"". So there's a fraction \\frac{2}{3} after 2. Maybe this is part of the problem? Wait, maybe the original problem had f'(0) = 2/3? But in the user's message, it's written as f'(0) = 2.\\frac{2}{3}$. Maybe a typo. But in the problem statement as presented, the user wrote f'(0) = 2.\\frac{2}{3}$, which is likely a formatting error. The correct problem probably has f'(0) = 2. So, given that, the answer is 12.

But just to be thorough, let's suppose that the problem actually has f'(0) = 2/3. Then, we would have to redo the calculations. Let's check.

Suppose f'(0) = 2/3. Then, in the previous steps, when we had E = f'(0) = 2/3. Then, the equations would be:

From f''(1) = 0: C + D = 0 => D = -C.

From f(1) = 0: (C/6) + (D/2) + E = 0 => (C/6) - (C/2) + 2/3 = 0 => (-C/3) + 2/3 = 0 => -C + 2 = 0 => C = 2.

Then, D = -2, E = 2/3, so f(x) = (2/6)x³ + (-2/2)x² + (2/3)x = (1/3)x³ - x² + (2/3)x.

Then, f''(x) = 2x -2, so (f''(x))² = (2x -2)^2 = 4(x -1)^2. Then, the integral ∫₀¹ 4(x -1)^2 dx = 4 ∫₀¹ (x² -2x +1) dx = 4*(1/3 -1 +1) = 4*(1/3) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333. But this is much smaller. However, since the problem states f'(0) = 2, the correct value is 12. Therefore, the user's problem likely had a typo, and the correct answer is 12.

Alternatively, if the problem indeed had f'(0) = 2/3, then the answer would be 4/3, but given the problem as stated with f'(0) = 2, the answer is 12. Therefore, I think the correct answer is 12. However, to be absolutely certain, let's check once more.

Given f'(0) = 2, leading to E = 2, and solving the equations gives f(x) = x³ -3x² +2x, f''(x)=6x-6, integral of (6x-6)^2 from 0 to1 is 12. Therefore, the minimum value is 12. So the answer should be \\boxed{12}.

","Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the integral of the square of the second derivative of a function f from 0 to 1. The function f has to be twice continuously differentiable on [0,1], and it satisfies the boundary conditions f(0) = 0, f(1) = 0, and also f'(0) = 2. Hmm, this seems like a calculus of variations problem. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in calculus of variations, to minimize a functional like the integral of (f''(x))² dx, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation. But wait, the Euler-Lagrange equation usually applies to functionals of the form ∫ F(x, f, f', f'') dx. In this case, our functional is ∫ (f''(x))² dx. So maybe I can set up the Euler-Lagrange equation for this functional with the given boundary conditions.

Let me write down the functional: J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. The boundary conditions are f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. But f'(1) isn't specified, so that's a natural boundary condition perhaps?

Wait, the standard Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional involving f'' would be a fourth-order differential equation. Let me recall that. If the functional is ∫ F(x, f, f', f'') dx, then the Euler-Lagrange equation is ∂F/∂f - d/dx(∂F/∂f') + d²/dx²(∂F/∂f'') = 0. But in our case, F(x, f, f', f'') = (f'')². So ∂F/∂f = 0, ∂F/∂f' = 0, and ∂F/∂f'' = 2f''. Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation becomes 0 - 0 + d²/dx²(2f'') = 0, which simplifies to f''''(x) = 0. So the minimum should be achieved by a function whose fourth derivative is zero. That means f(x) is a cubic polynomial. Because the fourth derivative is zero implies f'''(x) is constant, so f''(x) is linear, f'(x) is quadratic, and f(x) is cubic.

So f(x) can be written as ax³ + bx² + cx + d. But since f(0) = 0, plugging x=0 gives d=0. So f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx. Then f'(x) = 3ax² + 2bx + c. Applying f'(0) = 2 gives c=2. So f(x) = ax³ + bx² + 2x. Next, f(1) = 0, so a + b + 2 = 0. Also, f'(1) = 3a + 2b + 2. Wait, but what about f'(1)? Since the boundary condition at x=1 is only f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2. But since the original problem doesn't specify f'(1), maybe there's a natural boundary condition here. Let me check that.

In calculus of variations, when you have a functional involving f''(x), the natural boundary conditions come from the variation. Let me recall that. If we vary f by a function η(x) that satisfies η(0) = η(1) = 0 and η'(0) = 0 (since f'(0) is fixed), then the variation δJ would involve integrating by parts twice. Let's see:

δJ = ∫₀¹ 2f''(x) η''(x) dx.

Integrating by parts twice:

First integration by parts: let u = 2f''(x), dv = η''(x) dx. Then du = 2f'''(x) dx, v = η'(x). So δJ = [2f''(x) η'(x)]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ 2f'''(x) η'(x) dx.

Second integration by parts: u = -2f'''(x), dv = η'(x) dx. Then du = -2f''''(x) dx, v = η(x). So δJ = [2f''(x) η'(x)]₀¹ - [ -2f'''(x) η(x) ]₀¹ + ∫₀¹ 2f''''(x) η(x) dx.

Therefore, δJ = [2f''(1) η'(1) - 2f''(0) η'(0)] + [2f'''(1) η(1) - 2f'''(0) η(0)] + ∫₀¹ 2f''''(x) η(x) dx.

But since η(0) = η(1) = 0 and η'(0) = 0 (because f'(0) is fixed), the boundary terms simplify. Specifically:

- The term 2f''(0) η'(0) is zero because η'(0) = 0.
- The term 2f'''(0) η(0) is zero because η(0) = 0.
- The term 2f'''(1) η(1) is zero because η(1) = 0.
- The term 2f''(1) η'(1) remains.

Therefore, δJ = 2f''(1) η'(1) + ∫₀¹ 2f''''(x) η(x) dx.

For the variation to be zero for all admissible η(x), we need the integrand to be zero, so f''''(x) = 0, which we already considered, and also the boundary term must be zero. However, η'(1) is not specified, so unless 2f''(1) = 0, we can choose η'(1) arbitrarily. Wait, but in the problem statement, the only boundary conditions are f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2. There is no condition on f'(1). Therefore, the natural boundary condition here is that the coefficient of η'(1) must be zero, i.e., 2f''(1) = 0, so f''(1) = 0.

Therefore, in addition to the Euler-Lagrange equation f''''(x) = 0, we have the boundary condition f''(1) = 0. Let's verify this.

So, given that f''''(x) = 0, f''(x) is linear: f''(x) = mx + n. Then f'(x) = (m/2)x² + nx + c. But we already know that f'(0) = 2, so c = 2. Therefore, f'(x) = (m/2)x² + nx + 2. Then f(x) = (m/6)x³ + (n/2)x² + 2x + d. But f(0) = 0 implies d = 0. So f(x) = (m/6)x³ + (n/2)x² + 2x.

Now, applying the boundary condition f(1) = 0:

(m/6)(1)³ + (n/2)(1)² + 2(1) = m/6 + n/2 + 2 = 0.

Also, the natural boundary condition f''(1) = 0:

f''(x) = m x + n. At x=1, f''(1) = m + n = 0.

So we have two equations:

1. m/6 + n/2 + 2 = 0
2. m + n = 0

Let me solve these equations.

From equation 2: n = -m.

Substitute into equation 1:

m/6 + (-m)/2 + 2 = 0

Multiply all terms by 6 to eliminate denominators:

m - 3m + 12 = 0

Which simplifies to:

-2m + 12 = 0 => -2m = -12 => m = 6.

Then n = -m = -6.

Therefore, the cubic polynomial is:

f(x) = (6/6)x³ + (-6/2)x² + 2x = x³ - 3x² + 2x.

Let me verify the boundary conditions:

f(0) = 0, which is satisfied.

f(1) = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0, which is good.

f'(0) = 2, which is given.

f''(x) = 6x - 6, so f''(1) = 6*1 -6 = 0, which satisfies the natural boundary condition.

Great, so the function f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 2x is the minimizer.

Now, we need to compute the integral of (f''(x))² dx from 0 to1.

First, compute f''(x):

f''(x) = 6x - 6.

Therefore, (f''(x))² = (6x -6)^2 = 36(x -1)^2.

So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ 36(x -1)^2 dx.

Compute this integral:

First, expand (x -1)^2 = x² - 2x +1.

So ∫₀¹ 36(x² - 2x +1) dx = 36 [ ∫₀¹ x² dx - 2 ∫₀¹ x dx + ∫₀¹ 1 dx ]

Compute each integral:

∫₀¹ x² dx = [x³/3]₀¹ = 1/3.

∫₀¹ x dx = [x²/2]₀¹ = 1/2.

∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1.

Therefore:

36 [ (1/3 - 2*(1/2) +1 ) ] = 36 [ (1/3 -1 +1 ) ] = 36*(1/3) = 12.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check the calculation again.

Wait, (x -1)^2 = x² -2x +1, so integrating term by term:

∫₀¹ x² dx = 1/3,

∫₀¹ (-2x) dx = -2*(1/2) = -1,

∫₀¹ 1 dx =1.

So total inside the brackets: 1/3 -1 +1 = 1/3.

Multiply by 36: 36*(1/3) = 12. So the integral is 12.

Therefore, the minimum value is 12.

But wait, let me verify that this function indeed satisfies all the conditions and that there are no mistakes in the calculations.

First, f(x) = x³ -3x² +2x.

Check f(0) = 0, f(1)=1 -3 +2=0, f'(0)=3*0² -6*0 +2=2. Correct.

f''(x)=6x -6, so f''(1)=0, which is the natural boundary condition. Correct.

Integral of (6x -6)^2 from 0 to1 is 36*(x-1)^2 integrated, which we found to be 12. So that's the minimum value.

But let me think if there's another way to approach this, maybe using energy methods or something else. For example, sometimes in these problems, using integration by parts or orthogonality conditions.

Alternatively, since we are dealing with the square of the second derivative, maybe we can express the integral in terms of f''(x), and then relate it to the boundary conditions. But I think the calculus of variations approach is correct here, leading to the cubic function.

Another way to check is to consider the general solution of the differential equation f''''(x) =0, which gives f(x) as a cubic, and then applying the boundary conditions. Which is what we did. So seems solid.

Alternatively, maybe using Fourier series or eigenfunction expansion, but that might complicate things. The calculus of variations approach gives a straightforward solution here.

Therefore, I think the minimum value is 12.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value is \\boxed{12}.

","Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the integral of the square of the second derivative of a function f, right? The function has to be twice continuously differentiable on [0, 1], with f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. Hmm, this seems like a calculus of variations problem. I remember that to minimize an integral involving higher derivatives, we can use the Euler-Lagrange equation. But let me think step by step.

First, the functional we need to minimize is ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. The boundary conditions are f(0) = f(1) = 0 (Dirichlet boundary conditions), and f'(0) = 2. Wait, but there's also a condition on f'(0). In typical calculus of variations, we have fixed boundary conditions, but here we have a condition on the derivative at x=0. So maybe I need to consider natural boundary conditions as well? Or perhaps treat the derivative condition as part of the problem.

Let me recall. When dealing with higher derivatives, the Euler-Lagrange equation becomes more involved. For a functional involving f''(x), the Euler equation is the fourth-order differential equation. Let me check: if the functional is ∫ L(x, f, f', f'') dx, then the Euler-Lagrange equation is L_f - d/dx L_{f'} + d²/dx² L_{f''} = 0. But in our case, the functional is only depending on f''. So L = (f'')². Therefore, the Euler equation would be:

d²/dx² (2 f'') = 0

Which simplifies to:

2 f''''(x) = 0 ⇒ f''''(x) = 0

So the general solution is a cubic polynomial: f(x) = a x³ + b x² + c x + d. But wait, we need to apply boundary conditions. Let's see:

Given f(0) = 0 ⇒ d = 0.

f(1) = 0 ⇒ a + b + c + d = 0 ⇒ a + b + c = 0.

Also, f'(0) = 2 ⇒ c = 2.

So substituting c = 2 into the equation a + b + c = 0 gives a + b = -2.

But we need another boundary condition. Since the original problem has f''(1) maybe? Wait, but we didn't specify f''(1). In the calculus of variations, for higher derivatives, we need to consider natural boundary conditions. Let me recall: for the functional ∫ L dx, the natural boundary conditions arise from the variation at the endpoints. If the functional involves up to the second derivative, then we have to consider the conditions on f(1), f'(1), f''(1), etc. But here, the problem only specifies f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2. So maybe f'(1) is free? Or is there another condition?

Wait, perhaps I need to use the fact that the integral is being minimized. The Euler equation gives us f''''(x) = 0, so f(x) is a cubic polynomial. Let me write f(x) = a x³ + b x² + 2 x. Then we have f(1) = a + b + 2 = 0 ⇒ a + b = -2.

But we need another condition. Since the functional involves f''(x), maybe we need to apply the natural boundary conditions at x=1. Let's recall that when dealing with higher derivatives, the natural boundary conditions are obtained by integrating the Euler equation by parts. Let me try to derive them.

The functional is ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. Let's consider a variation f + ε η, where η is a function that satisfies η(0) = η(1) = 0 and η'(0) = 0. Wait, why η'(0) = 0? Because the derivative at x=0 is fixed (f'(0)=2), so variations should preserve that. So the variation η must satisfy η(0) = η(1) = 0 and η'(0) = 0. Therefore, when taking the variation, we have:

δJ = ∫₀¹ 2 f''(x) η''(x) dx

Integrate by parts twice:

First integration by parts:

= 2 f''(x) η'(x) |₀¹ - 2 ∫₀¹ f'''(x) η'(x) dx

But η'(1) is free, so the first term becomes 2 f''(1) η'(1) - 2 f''(0) η'(0). But η'(0) = 0, so the first term is 2 f''(1) η'(1). Then we have:

δJ = 2 f''(1) η'(1) - 2 ∫₀¹ f'''(x) η'(x) dx

Now integrate the second term by parts:

= 2 f''(1) η'(1) - 2 [f'''(x) η(x) |₀¹ - ∫₀¹ f''''(x) η(x) dx]

But η(1) = 0 and η(0) = 0, so the boundary terms vanish:

= 2 f''(1) η'(1) - 2 ∫₀¹ f''''(x) η(x) dx

But since the Euler equation is f''''(x) = 0, the integral term is zero. So δJ = 2 f''(1) η'(1). For the functional to be minimized, the first variation δJ must be zero for all admissible η. Therefore, we need 2 f''(1) η'(1) = 0 for all η with η'(1) arbitrary. Hence, f''(1) must be zero. So the natural boundary condition at x=1 is f''(1) = 0.

Therefore, the boundary conditions for the problem are:

1. f(0) = 0
2. f(1) = 0
3. f'(0) = 2
4. f''(1) = 0

So now we can write the cubic polynomial f(x) = a x³ + b x² + 2 x, with a + b + 2 = 0 (from f(1) = 0), and f''(x) = 6 a x + 2 b. At x=1, f''(1) = 6a + 2b = 0.

So we have two equations:

1. a + b = -2
2. 6a + 2b = 0

Let me solve these equations. From the second equation: 6a + 2b = 0 ⇒ 3a + b = 0 ⇒ b = -3a. Substitute into the first equation: a + (-3a) = -2 ⇒ -2a = -2 ⇒ a = 1. Then b = -3(1) = -3.

Therefore, the cubic polynomial is f(x) = x³ - 3x² + 2x.

Let me verify the boundary conditions:

f(0) = 0: yes.

f(1) = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0: yes.

f'(x) = 3x² - 6x + 2, so f'(0) = 0 - 0 + 2 = 2: yes.

f''(x) = 6x - 6, so f''(1) = 6 - 6 = 0: yes.

Okay, so this function satisfies all the conditions. Now, we need to compute the integral of (f''(x))² from 0 to 1.

Compute f''(x) = 6x - 6. Then (f''(x))² = (6x - 6)^2 = 36(x - 1)^2 = 36(x² - 2x + 1).

So the integral becomes ∫₀¹ 36(x² - 2x + 1) dx = 36 [ ∫₀¹ x² dx - 2 ∫₀¹ x dx + ∫₀¹ 1 dx ]

Compute each integral:

∫₀¹ x² dx = [x³/3]₀¹ = 1/3

∫₀¹ x dx = [x²/2]₀¹ = 1/2

∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1

Therefore, the integral is 36 [ (1/3) - 2*(1/2) + 1 ] = 36 [ (1/3) - 1 + 1 ] = 36*(1/3) = 12.

Wait, so the integral is 12? Let me check again:

Wait, 36*(1/3 - 1 + 1) = 36*(1/3) = 12. Yes, that's correct.

But wait, is this the minimal value? Let me think. The Euler equation gives us the cubic polynomial, and we applied the natural boundary condition at x=1 (f''(1)=0). So this should give the minimal value. Therefore, the minimal value is 12.

But let me verify if there could be another function that satisfies the conditions and gives a lower integral. Suppose someone suggests another function. But since the Euler equation leads us to a cubic polynomial, and we applied the natural boundary condition, this should be the unique minimizer. Therefore, the minimal value is 12.

But wait, the problem states ""Find the minimum value of ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx for functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0,1], satisfying f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2.""

So according to this, yes, 12 is the minimal value. But let me check once more.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using energy methods. The integral ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx is like the energy of the function's second derivative. To minimize this energy, we can think of it as a variational problem similar to a beam bending problem, where the energy is proportional to the integral of (f''(x))². The minimal energy configuration would be a cubic polynomial, which is what we found.

Alternatively, we can use orthogonality. Suppose we consider the function f''(x) = g(x). Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ g(x)² dx, and we need to find the minimal g(x) such that when integrated twice, the function f(x) satisfies f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2. But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, use integration by parts. Let's see:

Compute ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. Let me integrate by parts twice.

First, let u = f''(x), dv = f''(x) dx. Then du = f'''(x) dx, v = f'(x). Wait, but integrating by parts:

∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx = [f''(x) f'(x)]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ f'''(x) f'(x) dx

But we don't have information about f'''(x). Alternatively, integrate by parts again:

But maybe this approach isn't helpful. The previous method using calculus of variations seems more straightforward.

Alternatively, use the fact that the minimal is achieved when the function is a cubic polynomial, which is the solution we found. Therefore, the minimal value is 12.

But let me check another way. Suppose we parametrize the function. Let me think: since f(0)=0, f'(0)=2, f(1)=0. Let me try to express f(x) in terms of its Taylor expansion around x=0. But since f is a cubic, it would be f(x) = a x³ + b x² + 2 x. Then f(1) = a + b + 2 = 0 ⇒ a + b = -2. The natural boundary condition f''(1) = 0 gives f''(1) = 6a + 2b = 0. Solving these gives a=1, b=-3, which is what we had before. Therefore, the same result.

Therefore, I think the answer is 12. But let me confirm once more by calculating the integral:

(f''(x))² = (6x - 6)^2 = 36(x² - 2x + 1)

Integral from 0 to1:

36 [ x³/3 - x² + x ] from 0 to1

= 36 [ (1/3 - 1 + 1) - 0 ]

= 36*(1/3) = 12. Correct.

Therefore, the minimal value is 12.

","Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the integral from 0 to 1 of (f''(x))² dx, where the function f is twice continuously differentiable on [0,1], satisfies f(0) = f(1) = 0, and f'(0) = 2. Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.

First, this seems like a calculus of variations problem. The integral of the square of the second derivative is being minimized, so maybe I can use techniques from calculus of variations here. But I need to recall how those work. In calculus of variations, to minimize an integral involving higher derivatives, we might use the Euler-Lagrange equation. But the standard Euler-Lagrange equation is for functionals that depend on f and f', right? So when the functional depends on higher derivatives, like f'', we need to adjust the Euler-Lagrange equation accordingly.

Wait, the functional here is J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. So the integrand is L(f, f', f'') = (f'')². Since the integrand doesn't explicitly depend on f or f', maybe the Euler-Lagrange equation for higher derivatives comes into play. Let me recall: for a functional J[f] = ∫ L(x, f, f', f'', ..., f^{(n)}) dx, the Euler-Lagrange equation is a differential equation of order 2n. In this case, n=2, so the equation should be of order 4. But that seems complicated. Maybe there's a simpler way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use integration by parts to reduce the order of derivatives. Let me try that. Let's consider integrating (f'')². If I let u = f'' and dv = f'' dx, but that might not help. Wait, maybe if I integrate by parts, treating f'' as the derivative. Let me set u = f'' and dv = f'' dx. Then du = f''' dx and v = f''. But integrating by parts gives uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [f''(x) f''(x)]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ (f'')² dx. Wait, that's not helpful because it leads to ∫₀¹ (f'')² dx = [f''(x) f''(x)]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ (f'')² dx, which rearranges to 2 ∫₀¹ (f'')² dx = [f''(x) f''(x)]₀¹. But that would imply the integral is equal to half the boundary terms. But I don't have information about f''(0) or f''(1). So maybe this isn't the right approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider a substitution. Let me set g(x) = f'(x). Then f''(x) = g'(x). Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (g'(x))² dx. So the problem reduces to minimizing ∫₀¹ (g'(x))² dx with the conditions that g(0) = f'(0) = 2, and since f(1) = 0, we have f(1) = 0, so integrating g from 0 to 1 gives f(1) = ∫₀¹ g(x) dx = 0. Wait, but f(1) = 0, so the integral of g(x) from 0 to 1 must be 0. So now, the problem is to minimize ∫₀¹ (g')² dx subject to g(0) = 2 and ∫₀¹ g(x) dx = 0. That seems more manageable. So maybe this substitution simplifies the problem.

So now, we have a new functional: J[g] = ∫₀¹ (g'(x))² dx, with boundary condition g(0) = 2 and integral condition ∫₀¹ g(x) dx = 0. How do we handle this? It's a variational problem with an integral constraint. For such problems, we can use Lagrange multipliers. So we can introduce a multiplier λ and consider the functional J[g] = ∫₀¹ (g')² dx + λ (∫₀¹ g(x) dx). Then take the variation with respect to g and λ.

Wait, but the integral condition is a constraint, so the method of Lagrange multipliers applies here. So the Euler-Lagrange equation for the new functional would be derived by taking the variation.

Let me write the functional again: J[g] = ∫₀¹ (g')² dx + λ ∫₀¹ g dx. Then the variation δJ = ∫₀¹ 2g' δg' dx + λ ∫₀¹ δg dx. Integration by parts on the first term gives 2g' δg |₀¹ - 2 ∫₀¹ g'' δg dx + λ ∫₀¹ δg dx. Since δg(0) can be arbitrary, but we have a boundary condition at x=0 (g(0)=2), but δg(0) is zero because g(0) is fixed. Similarly, at x=1, δg(1) is free? Wait, but in the original problem, we had f(1)=0, which is a boundary condition, but here, after substitution, the integral condition ∫₀¹ g(x) dx =0 is an integral constraint, not a boundary condition. So in the variation, δg(1) is free. Therefore, the boundary terms at x=1 would be 2g'(1) δg(1) + λ δg(1). But since δg(1) is arbitrary, this term must be zero. Therefore, 2g'(1) + λ = 0. So that's a natural boundary condition at x=1.

Additionally, the Euler-Lagrange equation from the variation is -2g''(x) + λ = 0. So the differential equation is g''(x) = λ/2. Integrating once, g'(x) = (λ/2)x + C. Integrating again, g(x) = (λ/4)x² + Cx + D. But we have boundary conditions: g(0) = 2, so plugging x=0, we get D = 2. Then the other boundary condition is the natural condition at x=1: 2g'(1) + λ = 0. Let's compute g'(x) = (λ/2)x + C. At x=1, g'(1) = (λ/2) + C. Therefore, 2[(λ/2) + C] + λ = 0 ⇒ λ + 2C + λ = 0 ⇒ 2λ + 2C = 0 ⇒ λ + C = 0 ⇒ C = -λ.

So the function g(x) is g(x) = (λ/4)x² - λ x + 2. Now, we also have the integral condition ∫₀¹ g(x) dx = 0. Let's compute that:

∫₀¹ [(λ/4)x² - λ x + 2] dx = (λ/4)(x³/3)|₀¹ - λ (x²/2)|₀¹ + 2x|₀¹

= (λ/4)(1/3) - λ(1/2) + 2(1 - 0)

= λ/12 - λ/2 + 2

= λ(1/12 - 6/12) + 2

= (-5λ/12) + 2 = 0

So solving for λ:

-5λ/12 + 2 = 0 ⇒ -5λ/12 = -2 ⇒ λ = (12/5)*2 = 24/5.

Therefore, λ = 24/5. Then C = -λ = -24/5.

So the function g(x) is:

g(x) = (24/5 / 4)x² - (24/5)x + 2 = (6/5)x² - (24/5)x + 2

Simplify:

g(x) = (6/5)x² - (24/5)x + 2.

Now, let's check if this satisfies the integral condition:

Compute ∫₀¹ g(x) dx:

∫₀¹ [(6/5)x² - (24/5)x + 2] dx

= (6/5)(x³/3)|₀¹ - (24/5)(x²/2)|₀¹ + 2x|₀¹

= (6/15)(1 - 0) - (24/10)(1 - 0) + 2(1 - 0)

= (2/5) - (12/5) + 2

= (-10/5) + 2

= -2 + 2 = 0. Perfect, that works.

Now, we can compute the integral J[g] = ∫₀¹ (g'(x))² dx. First, compute g'(x):

g'(x) = (12/5)x - 24/5.

So (g'(x))² = [(12/5)x - 24/5]^2 = (12/5)^2 (x - 2)^2 = (144/25)(x - 2)^2.

Integrating from 0 to 1:

∫₀¹ 144/25 (x - 2)^2 dx = 144/25 ∫₀¹ (x² -4x +4) dx

= 144/25 [ (x³/3 - 2x² +4x) ]₀¹

= 144/25 [ (1/3 - 2 +4) - 0 ]

= 144/25 (1/3 +2) = 144/25 (7/3) = (144 *7)/(25*3) = (144/3)*(7/25) = 48 *7/25 = 336/25.

Wait, 48*7 is 336, so 336/25 = 13.44. But let me check the calculation again.

Wait, let's compute step by step:

∫₀¹ (x² -4x +4) dx

= [x³/3 - 2x² +4x] from 0 to1

At x=1: 1/3 -2 +4 = 1/3 +2 = 7/3

At x=0: 0 -0 +0 =0

So the integral is 7/3. Then 144/25 *7/3 = (144/3)*(7/25)=48*7/25=336/25=13.44. So 336 divided by 25 is 13.44, which is 13 and 6/25. So in fraction form, 336/25.

But 336 divided by 25 reduces to 13.44, but let's see if 336 and 25 have common factors. 25 factors are 5², 336 is 16*21=16*3*7. So no common factors. So 336/25 is the exact value. So the minimum value of the integral is 336/25, which is 13.44. But let me confirm the steps again to make sure.

Wait, starting with the substitution g(x) = f'(x), then f''(x)=g'(x), so the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (g')² dx. Then the problem becomes minimizing ∫₀¹ (g')² dx with g(0)=2 and ∫₀¹ g dx=0. Then using Lagrange multipliers, we set up the functional with λ and derived the Euler-Lagrange equation. Then solved for g(x), found λ=24/5, and computed the integral. That seems correct.

But let me check if the function g(x) = (6/5)x² - (24/5)x + 2 actually satisfies f(1)=0. Wait, f(1)=0, but f(x) is the antiderivative of g(x). So f(x) = ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt. Therefore, f(1)=∫₀¹ g(t) dt =0, which is our constraint. So that's satisfied. Also, f(0)=0, which is given. So all the boundary conditions are satisfied.

Additionally, f'(0)=g(0)=2, which matches the given condition. So everything checks out.

Therefore, the minimum value of the integral is 336/25, which is equal to (144/25)*(7/3) = 336/25. Let me verify once more the calculation of the integral:

(g'(x))² = (12/5 x -24/5)^2 = (12/5)^2 (x -2)^2 = 144/25 (x² -4x +4). Then integrating from 0 to1:

144/25 ∫₀¹ (x² -4x +4) dx = 144/25 [ (1/3 -2 +4) ] = 144/25 (1/3 +2) = 144/25 *7/3 = (144/3)*7/25 = 48*7/25 = 336/25. Yes, that's correct.

So the minimum value is 336/25, which simplifies to 13.44. But let me check if there's a simpler way to write 336/25. 336 divided by 25 is 13.44, but as a fraction, 336/25 cannot be reduced further. So the answer should be 336/25. Therefore, the minimum value of the integral is 336/25.

But wait, let me think again. The problem statement mentions ""Find the minimum value of ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx..."". But through substitution, we transformed it into minimizing ∫₀¹ (g')² dx with g(0)=2 and ∫₀¹ g dx=0. Then via calculus of variations with Lagrange multipliers, we found the function g that minimizes the integral. Then computed the integral value as 336/25. So that should be correct.

But just to make sure, let's consider if there's another approach. For example, using energy minimization or something else. Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the problem is a fourth-order differential equation. Wait, originally, the Euler-Lagrange equation for the functional J[f] = ∫ (f'')² dx would be a fourth-order differential equation. Let me try that approach.

The functional is J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. The Euler-Lagrange equation for this functional is obtained by taking the variation. Let's compute the variation δJ. For a small perturbation δf, the variation δJ is:

δJ = ∫₀¹ 2f''(x) δf''(x) dx.

Integrate by parts twice:

First integration by parts: Let u = 2f''(x), dv = δf''(x) dx. Then du = 2f'''(x) dx, v = δf'(x). So:

δJ = uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = 2f''(x) δf'(x)|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ δf'(x) 2f'''(x) dx.

Second integration by parts: Let u = -2f'''(x), dv = δf'(x) dx. Then du = -2f''''(x) dx, v = δf(x). So:

δJ = [2f''(x) δf'(x)]₀¹ - [ -2f'''(x) δf(x)]₀¹ + ∫₀¹ δf(x) 2f''''(x) dx.

Therefore, δJ = 2f''(x) δf'(x)|₀¹ + 2f'''(x) δf(x)|₀¹ + 2 ∫₀¹ f''''(x) δf(x) dx.

For the variation δJ to be zero for all δf satisfying the boundary conditions, the coefficients of δf and δf' must vanish. The boundary terms must be zero, and the integral term must be zero. However, our problem has boundary conditions f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2. What about f'(1)? Is it free? In the original problem, there's no condition on f'(1). So in the variation, δf(0)=0 because f(0)=0 is fixed, δf(1) is free, δf'(0)=0 because f'(0)=2 is fixed, and δf'(1) is free. Therefore, the boundary terms must be zero:

At x=0: 2f''(0) δf'(0) + 2f'''(0) δf(0) = 0. But δf(0)=0 and δf'(0)=0, so this term is zero.

At x=1: 2f''(1) δf'(1) + 2f'''(1) δf(1) = 0. Since δf'(1) and δf(1) are arbitrary (as there are no constraints on f'(1) and f(1) except f(1)=0, but f(1)=0 is already satisfied), the coefficients must be zero:

2f''(1) = 0 and 2f'''(1) = 0. Therefore, f''(1)=0 and f'''(1)=0.

Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation is f''''(x) = 0, from the integral term. So the solution is a cubic polynomial: f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Applying the boundary conditions:

1. f(0)=0: 0 + 0 +0 +d=0 ⇒ d=0.

2. f(1)=0: a + b + c +0=0 ⇒ a + b + c=0.

3. f'(0)=2: 3a(0)² + 2b(0) + c = c =2 ⇒ c=2.

So from condition 2: a + b +2=0 ⇒ a + b= -2.

Also, from the natural boundary conditions at x=1: f''(1)=0 and f'''(1)=0.

Compute f''(x)=6ax + 2b. At x=1: 6a + 2b =0 ⇒ 3a + b=0.

Compute f'''(x)=6a. At x=1:6a=0 ⇒ a=0.

Then from a=0, a + b= -2 ⇒ 0 + b= -2 ⇒ b= -2.

Therefore, the function is f(x)=0x³ + (-2)x² +2x +0= -2x² +2x.

So f(x)= -2x² +2x. Let's check the conditions:

f(0)=0, f(1)= -2 +2=0. f'(x)= -4x +2, so f'(0)=2. Correct.

Compute f''(x)= -4, so (f''(x))²=16. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹16 dx=16*1=16. Wait, that contradicts the previous result of 336/25=13.44. So which one is correct?

Wait, this is confusing. According to the Euler-Lagrange equation approach, the solution is f(x)= -2x² +2x, leading to the integral of (f'')²=16 from 0 to1, which is 16. But according to the substitution method, the minimum is 336/25=13.44. Which one is right?

There must be a mistake here. Let me check.

Wait, if we directly apply the Euler-Lagrange equation for the original functional J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f'')² dx, then the Euler-Lagrange equation is f''''(x)=0, leading to a cubic polynomial. Then applying boundary conditions f(0)=f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, and the natural conditions f''(1)=0, f'''(1)=0. But in the original problem, there was no constraint on f'(1), so the natural boundary conditions are f''(1)=0 and f'''(1)=0, which we used. Then solving gives f(x)= -2x² +2x, which leads to the integral of (f'')²=16, which is 16. But according to the substitution method, we found a lower value of 336/25≈13.44. So there's a conflict here.

Therefore, one of the approaches is wrong. Let me check both methods again.

First, in the substitution approach, we set g(x)=f'(x), transforming the problem into minimizing ∫₀¹ (g')² dx with g(0)=2 and ∫₀¹ g dx=0. Then using calculus of variations with Lagrange multipliers, we found g(x)=6/5 x² -24/5 x +2. Then the integral of (g')²=336/25≈13.44. But in the direct approach, solving the Euler-Lagrange equation gives f(x)= -2x² +2x, which leads to the integral being 16. So clearly, the substitution method gives a lower value. Therefore, the substitution approach must be correct, and the direct approach is missing something.

Wait, but why the discrepancy? Let me check the direct approach again. The functional is J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f'')² dx. The Euler-Lagrange equation is f''''(x)=0. Solving this gives f(x)=ax³ +bx² +cx +d. Applying boundary conditions:

1. f(0)=0 ⇒ d=0.

2. f(1)=0 ⇒ a + b +c=0.

3. f'(0)=2 ⇒ c=2.

4. Natural boundary conditions: f''(1)=0 and f'''(1)=0.

Compute f''(x)=6ax +2b. At x=1:6a +2b=0 ⇒ 3a +b=0.

Compute f'''(x)=6a. At x=1:6a=0 ⇒ a=0. Then from a=0, 3a +b=0 ⇒ b=0. Then from a +b +c=0 ⇒0 +0 +2=0 ⇒2=0, which is a contradiction. Wait, this can't be. Wait, wait, if a=0, then 3a +b=0 ⇒b=0. Then from a +b +c=0 ⇒0 +0 +c=0 ⇒c=0, but we have f'(0)=2 ⇒c=2. So this is impossible. Therefore, there's a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. If we have the natural boundary conditions f''(1)=0 and f'''(1)=0, then from f'''(x)=6a, setting a=0. Then f''(x)=6a x +2b=2b. So f''(1)=2b=0 ⇒b=0. Then from f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, we have:

f(x)=0x³ +0x² +2x +0=2x. But f(1)=2*1=2≠0. Contradiction. So something is wrong here.

Wait, this suggests that the assumption of natural boundary conditions f''(1)=0 and f'''(1)=0 leads to a contradiction when combined with the given boundary conditions. Therefore, the direct approach might not be applicable here because the problem is not well-posed with the given boundary conditions and the natural conditions. Alternatively, perhaps the substitution approach is correct because it properly accounts for the integral constraint.

Alternatively, maybe the confusion arises from different approaches. The substitution method seems more straightforward because it reduces the problem to a standard calculus of variations problem with an integral constraint, which is handled via Lagrange multipliers. The direct approach using Euler-Lagrange for the fourth-order equation leads to inconsistency, which suggests that perhaps the natural boundary conditions are not appropriate here when combined with the given conditions f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2.

Therefore, the substitution approach is more reliable here. Let me verify the solution obtained through substitution again.

We have f(x) = ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt, where g(x)=6/5 x² -24/5 x +2. Let's compute f(x):

f(x) = ∫₀ˣ (6/5 t² -24/5 t +2) dt

= (6/5)(x³/3) - (24/5)(x²/2) +2x + C

= (2/5)x³ - (12/5)x² +2x + C.

But since f(0)=0, C=0. Therefore, f(x)= (2/5)x³ - (12/5)x² +2x.

Check f(1)= (2/5 -12/5 +2)= (-10/5 +2)= -2 +2=0. Correct.

Check f'(x)= (6/5)x² - (24/5)x +2. Then f'(0)=2. Correct.

Compute f''(x)= (12/5)x -24/5. Then f''(0)= -24/5, and f''(1)=12/5 -24/5= -12/5. So the integral of (f'')² from 0 to1 is ∫₀¹ (12/5 x -24/5)^2 dx=336/25≈13.44. But in the direct approach, we encountered a contradiction, which suggests that the substitution method is the correct way to handle this problem.

Therefore, the minimum value is indeed 336/25. But let me check if there's a miscalculation in the direct approach.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when we derived the Euler-Lagrange equation for the original functional J[f], we have to consider that the functional is in terms of f, f', f''. The standard Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional involving f'' is different. Let me recall that for a functional J[f] = ∫ L(x, f, f', f'') dx, the Euler-Lagrange equation is:

d²/dx² (∂L/∂f'') - d/dx (∂L/∂f') + ∂L/∂f =0.

In our case, L= (f'')², so ∂L/∂f'' = 2f'', ∂L/∂f' =0, ∂L/∂f=0. Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation is:

d²/dx² (2f'') - d/dx (0) +0=0 ⇒ d²/dx² (2f'') =0 ⇒ 2f''''(x)=0 ⇒ f''''(x)=0. So that's correct. So f(x) is a cubic polynomial. But when applying boundary conditions, we have to consider the natural boundary conditions at x=1. However, in our problem, the boundary conditions are f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2. The natural boundary conditions are f''(1)=0 and f'''(1)=0. However, when solving for the coefficients, we end up with an inconsistency, which suggests that such a function does not exist under these conditions. Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation approach leads us into a contradiction, meaning that the minimum is not achieved by a function that satisfies all the natural boundary conditions. Therefore, the substitution approach is the valid one here because it properly accounts for the integral constraint.

Thus, the correct minimum value is 336/25, which is 13.44. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{\\dfrac{336}{25}}.

**Final Answer**
\\boxed{\\dfrac{336}{25}}

","Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the integral of (f''(x))² from 0 to 1 for functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0,1], with boundary conditions f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. Hmm, let's start by recalling some calculus of variations techniques. 

First, this looks like a problem where we need to minimize a functional, which is the integral of a square of the second derivative. Since the functional involves the second derivative, maybe I can use Euler-Lagrange equations for higher derivatives. The standard Euler-Lagrange equation for a functional J[f] = ∫ L(x, f, f', f'') dx is ∂L/∂f - d/dx (∂L/∂f') + d²/dx² (∂L/∂f'') = 0. 

In this case, the Lagrangian L is (f''(x))². So, ∂L/∂f = 0, ∂L/∂f' = 0, and ∂L/∂f'' = 2f''(x). Plugging into the Euler-Lagrange equation, we get d²/dx² (2f''(x)) = 0. That simplifies to 2f''''(x) = 0, so f''''(x) = 0. Integrating this four times should give us the general solution. Let's see:

Integrating f''''(x) = 0 once: f'''(x) = C₁
Integrating again: f''(x) = C₁x + C₂
Third time: f'(x) = (C₁/2)x² + C₂x + C₃
Fourth time: f(x) = (C₁/6)x³ + (C₂/2)x² + C₃x + C₄

Now, we need to apply the boundary conditions. Let's list them:

1. f(0) = 0: Plugging x=0 into f(x) gives C₄ = 0.
2. f(1) = 0: Plugging x=1 into f(x) gives (C₁/6) + (C₂/2) + C₃ + C₄ = 0. But C₄ is 0, so we get C₁/6 + C₂/2 + C₃ = 0.
3. f'(0) = 2: Plugging x=0 into f'(x) gives C₃ = 2.
4. What about the other boundary condition? Since the original problem has Dirichlet conditions at 0 and 1, and a Neumann condition at 0 (f'(0) = 2), but what about at x=1? Wait, maybe we need to check if there are natural boundary conditions from the Euler-Lagrange equation. However, since we're dealing with a fourth-order differential equation, the natural boundary conditions would typically involve f''(1) and f'''(1), but they are not specified here. Wait, but in the problem statement, only f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2 are given. The other boundary conditions (like f'(1) or f''(1)) are not specified. Hmm, maybe I need to consider that the minimizer will satisfy some natural boundary conditions at x=1. Let me recall that for higher-order variational problems, the natural boundary conditions are derived from the variation of the functional. Let me think.

The functional is J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. To derive the natural boundary conditions, we can consider the variation δf. The variation of J is δJ = ∫₀¹ 2f''(x) δf''(x) dx. Integrating by parts, we get δJ = 2f''(x) δf'(x) |₀¹ - 2f'''(x) δf(x) |₀¹ + 2∫₀¹ f'''(x) δf'(x) dx. Then, integrating by parts again, δJ = 2f''(x) δf'(x) |₀¹ - 2f'''(x) δf(x) |₀¹ + 2f'''(x) δf(x) |₀¹ - 2f''''(x) δf(x) |₀¹ - 2∫₀¹ f''''(x) δf(x) dx. 

But since the Euler-Lagrange equation is f''''(x) = 0, the integral term becomes zero, so δJ = [2f''(x) δf'(x) - 2f'''(x) δf(x)] |₀¹. For the variation δf to be arbitrary, the natural boundary conditions would be that the coefficients of δf'(x) and δf(x) at x=0 and x=1 must be zero. However, since we have already specified f(0)=0, f(1)=0, and f'(0)=2, maybe the natural boundary conditions at x=1 are that f''(1) = 0 and f'''(1) = 0? Wait, let me check. If we have the variation δf(x) that satisfies δf(0)=0, δf(1)=0, δf'(0)=0, then δf'(1) and δf''(1) are free. Therefore, the coefficients of δf'(1) and δf''(1) must be zero. But from the expression above, δJ = [2f''(x) δf'(x) - 2f'''(x) δf(x)] |₀¹. Therefore, at x=1, we have 2f''(1) δf'(1) - 2f'''(1) δf(1) = 0. But δf(1) = 0, so 2f''(1) δf'(1) = 0. Since δf'(1) can be arbitrary, this implies f''(1) = 0. Similarly, at x=0, the expression is 2f''(0) δf'(0) - 2f'''(0) δf(0) = 0. But δf'(0) is constrained because we have f'(0) fixed. Wait, actually, in our problem, f'(0) is fixed, so δf'(0) = 0. Therefore, the term at x=0 is 2f''(0) * 0 - 2f'''(0) * 0 = 0, so no conditions there. So the natural boundary condition at x=1 is f''(1) = 0.

Therefore, in addition to the given boundary conditions, we have f''(1) = 0. So now, let's collect all the boundary conditions:

1. f(0) = 0
2. f(1) = 0
3. f'(0) = 2
4. f''(1) = 0

Wait, but does the problem specify f''(1)? The original problem only specifies f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2. So perhaps the natural boundary condition at x=1 is f''(1) = 0. Therefore, we need to include this in our set of equations.

So let's go back to our general solution:

f(x) = (C₁/6)x³ + (C₂/2)x² + C₃x + C₄

But we already found that C₄ = 0 from f(0) = 0. Then, f'(x) = (C₁/2)x² + C₂x + C₃. From f'(0) = 2, we get C₃ = 2. So f'(x) = (C₁/2)x² + C₂x + 2.

Then, f''(x) = C₁x + C₂. The natural boundary condition at x=1 is f''(1) = 0, so C₁*1 + C₂ = 0 => C₁ + C₂ = 0. 

Then, we also have the condition f(1) = 0. Let's plug x=1 into f(x):

f(1) = (C₁/6)(1)³ + (C₂/2)(1)² + C₃(1) + C₄ = C₁/6 + C₂/2 + C₃ + C₄ = 0

But C₃ = 2, C₄ = 0, so:

C₁/6 + C₂/2 + 2 = 0

But we also have C₁ + C₂ = 0 from the natural boundary condition. So let's solve these two equations:

1. C₁ + C₂ = 0
2. C₁/6 + C₂/2 + 2 = 0

From equation 1, C₂ = -C₁. Substitute into equation 2:

C₁/6 + (-C₁)/2 + 2 = 0

Multiply all terms by 6 to eliminate denominators:

C₁ - 3C₁ + 12 = 0

Combine like terms:

-2C₁ + 12 = 0 => -2C₁ = -12 => C₁ = 6

Then, C₂ = -6

Therefore, the function f(x) is:

f(x) = (6/6)x³ + (-6/2)x² + 2x + 0 = x³ - 3x² + 2x

Let me check if this satisfies all the conditions:

1. f(0) = 0: Yes.
2. f(1) = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0: Yes.
3. f'(0) = 0 + 0 + 2 = 2: Yes.
4. f''(1) = 6x - 6 evaluated at x=1: 6*1 -6 = 0: Yes.

Great, so this function satisfies all the boundary conditions. Now, we need to compute the integral of (f''(x))² from 0 to 1. Let's compute f''(x):

f''(x) = 6x - 6

Therefore, (f''(x))² = (6x -6)^2 = 36(x -1)^2

So the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ 36(x -1)^2 dx = 36 ∫₀¹ (x² - 2x +1) dx

Compute each term:

∫₀¹ x² dx = [x³/3]₀¹ = 1/3

∫₀¹ -2x dx = -2 [x²/2]₀¹ = -2*(1/2 -0) = -1

∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1

Therefore, the integral is 36*(1/3 -1 +1) = 36*(1/3) = 12.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me verify again.

Wait, expanding (x -1)^2 is x² - 2x +1. So integrating term by term:

∫₀¹ x² dx = 1/3

∫₀¹ -2x dx = -2*(1/2) = -1

∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1

So total is (1/3 -1 +1) = 1/3. Then 36*(1/3) = 12. So the integral is 12. Therefore, the minimal value is 12.

But wait, let me check if this is indeed the minimum. Since the functional is convex (the integrand is (f'')², which is convex in f''), so the Euler-Lagrange equation should give a unique minimizer. Therefore, this should be the minimal value.

But just to be thorough, let's think if there's another approach. Maybe using integration by parts or some orthogonality conditions. Alternatively, since we're dealing with the square of the second derivative, perhaps using Fourier series or eigenfunction expansions. But given that we have a fourth-order ODE with the found boundary conditions, and the solution is a cubic polynomial, which is the general solution. So I think the answer is 12.

But wait, let me check my calculations again. The function f(x) = x³ -3x² + 2x. Then f''(x) = 6x -6. Squared is 36(x -1)^2. Integrate from 0 to 1:

36 ∫₀¹ (x -1)^2 dx. Let me compute ∫₀¹ (x -1)^2 dx. Let u = x -1, then du = dx, limits from -1 to 0. So ∫_{-1}^0 u² du = [u³/3]_{-1}^0 = 0 - (-1/3) = 1/3. Therefore, 36*(1/3) = 12. Correct.

Alternatively, expanding (x -1)^2 = x² - 2x +1. Integrate term by term:

∫₀¹ x² dx = 1/3

∫₀¹ -2x dx = -1

∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1

Sum: 1/3 -1 +1 = 1/3. Multiply by 36: 12. Correct.

Therefore, the minimal value of the integral is 12. So the answer should be 12, boxed.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value is \\boxed{12}.

","Okay, so I need to find the minimum value of the integral from 0 to 1 of (f''(x))² dx for functions f that are twice continuously differentiable on [0,1], with boundary conditions f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that this is an optimization problem involving calculus of variations. The goal is to minimize a functional, which in this case is the integral of the square of the second derivative. The constraints are given by the boundary conditions.

Let me recall that in calculus of variations, to find extrema of functionals, we use the Euler-Lagrange equation. But wait, the standard Euler-Lagrange equation applies to functionals that depend on f and its first derivative, but here the functional depends on the second derivative. So maybe I need to adjust the approach.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use integration by parts to reduce the order of the derivatives. Let me try that. If I consider the integral ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx, maybe I can integrate by parts to eliminate the second derivative. Let's see.

Let me set u = f''(x) and dv = f''(x) dx. Wait, that might not help directly. Alternatively, think of the integral as ∫₀¹ f''(x) * f''(x) dx. Integration by parts for this would give:

Let u = f''(x), dv = f''(x) dx
Then du = f'''(x) dx, v = f'(x)

So, ∫ u dv = uv|₀¹ - ∫ v du = f''(x) f'(x)|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ f'(x) f'''(x) dx

But f''(x) f'(x) evaluated at 0 and 1. However, we don't know f''(0) or f''(1), unless we can find them from the boundary conditions. Wait, the boundary conditions given are f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. There's no condition on f'(1). Hmm.

So maybe integrating by parts once isn't helpful because we don't have information about f''(0) and f''(1). Alternatively, maybe we need to consider integrating by parts twice.

Alternatively, perhaps a better approach is to use the calculus of variations directly. Let me set up the functional J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx, with the constraints f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2.

In calculus of variations, when dealing with functionals involving higher derivatives, the Euler-Lagrange equation becomes more complicated. Specifically, for a functional J[f] = ∫ L(x, f, f', f'') dx, the Euler-Lagrange equation is:

d²/dx² (∂L/∂f'') - d/dx (∂L/∂f') + ∂L/∂f = 0

In our case, L = (f'')², so ∂L/∂f'' = 2f'', and ∂L/∂f' = ∂L/∂f = 0.

Therefore, the Euler-Lagrange equation becomes:

d²/dx² (2f'') = 0

Simplifying, this gives:

2f''''(x) = 0 ⇒ f''''(x) = 0

Therefore, the general solution is a cubic polynomial: f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d

But applying the boundary conditions:

f(0) = 0 ⇒ d = 0

f(1) = 0 ⇒ a + b + c + d = 0 ⇒ a + b + c = 0

f'(0) = 2 ⇒ f'(x) = 3ax² + 2bx + c ⇒ f'(0) = c = 2

So c = 2. Then from f(1) = 0: a + b + 2 = 0 ⇒ a + b = -2

Now, the fourth derivative is zero, so f''''(x) = 0, which is the highest derivative in the equation. But we have four constants here: a, b, c, d. But since d = 0 and c = 2, we need two more conditions to solve for a and b. However, in the variational problem, sometimes natural boundary conditions come into play. Let me think.

But in this case, since the problem is to minimize the integral of (f'')² with the given boundary conditions, maybe the natural boundary conditions would be zero Neumann conditions for the second derivative? Wait, perhaps not. Let me recall that when you have higher derivatives in the functional, you might need additional boundary conditions to make the problem well-posed. However, in this problem, the given boundary conditions are f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. The problem doesn't specify f'(1), so perhaps that's why we need to use the Euler-Lagrange equation and the fact that f''''(x) = 0, which gives a cubic polynomial, but then we have two free parameters a and b, which need to be determined by the boundary conditions.

Wait, but we already have f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2, but we still need another condition. However, since the fourth derivative is zero, maybe there are no additional boundary conditions necessary? That seems confusing. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in applying the Euler-Lagrange equation.

Wait, perhaps the functional J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx is being minimized over functions in a space with the given boundary conditions. Since the Euler-Lagrange equation gives f''''(x) = 0, which leads to a cubic polynomial, but with the given boundary conditions, we can find a and b. Wait, but if f''''(x) = 0, then f'''(x) is a constant, say k. Then f''(x) = kx + m, f'(x) = (k/2)x² + mx + n, f(x) = (k/6)x³ + (m/2)x² + nx + p.

But given f(0) = 0, p = 0. Then f'(0) = n = 2. Then f(1) = (k/6) + (m/2) + 2 = 0. Also, f'(1) = (k/2) + m + 2. But we don't have any condition on f'(1). However, if the fourth derivative is zero, then perhaps there are no additional boundary conditions needed? Wait, but the problem is that the fourth derivative is zero, which is the highest derivative in the equation. So the general solution should be a cubic polynomial, but we have four boundary conditions: f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, and what about f'(1)? Since the problem doesn't specify f'(1), maybe it's a free variable? But that can't be, because we need to minimize the integral. Wait, this seems conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the problem as a fourth-order differential equation with three boundary conditions. But the Euler-Lagrange equation here is f''''(x)=0, which is a fourth-order equation, but we have only three boundary conditions: f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2. So perhaps there is a missing condition? Or maybe the problem is underdetermined?

Wait, but in the calculus of variations, when you have a functional involving higher derivatives, the natural boundary conditions must be considered. For example, if the functional is J = ∫ L(x, f, f', f'') dx, then the variation of J would involve integrating by parts, and the boundary terms would involve f', f'', etc. Therefore, the natural boundary conditions would be the ones that make those boundary terms zero. In our case, the functional is J = ∫ (f'')² dx. Let me try to compute the variation.

Let me consider a variation f + εη, where η is a function that satisfies the boundary conditions: η(0) = η(1) = 0 (since f(0) and f(1) are fixed) and η'(0) = 0 (since f'(0) is fixed). Wait, but actually, when taking variations, the boundary conditions might impose that the variations η must satisfy certain conditions. Let me recall that for the problem with fixed f(0) and f(1), and fixed f'(0), the variations η must satisfy η(0) = η(1) = 0 and η'(0) = 0. Therefore, when computing the variation of J, we have:

δJ = d/dε ε=0 ∫₀¹ (f'' + εη'')² dx = 2 ∫₀¹ f'' η'' dx

Then, integrating by parts twice:

First integration by parts:

∫₀¹ f'' η'' dx = [f'' η']₀¹ - ∫₀¹ f''' η' dx

But η' is zero at x=0 because η'(0)=0, and η' at x=1 is not specified. Wait, but η'(1) is not necessarily zero. However, the boundary terms at x=0 would be [f''(0) η'(0)] = 0 because η'(0)=0. At x=1, we have [f''(1) η'(1)], but η'(1) is not necessarily zero. So the first integration by parts gives:

∫₀¹ f'' η'' dx = - ∫₀¹ f''' η' dx + [f''(1) η'(1)]

But since η'(1) is not zero in general, we have an extra term here. Therefore, the variation δJ is:

δJ = 2 [ - ∫₀¹ f''' η' dx + f''(1) η'(1) ]

Then, integrating by parts again:

- ∫₀¹ f''' η' dx = [f'''(x) η(x)]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ f''''(x) η(x) dx

But η(0) = η(1) = 0, so the boundary terms vanish. Therefore:

δJ = 2 [ - ( [f'''(1) η(1) - f'''(0) η(0) ] ) - ∫₀¹ f''''(x) η(x) dx + f''(1) η'(1) ]

But η(1) = η(0) = 0, so δJ simplifies to:

δJ = 2 [ - ∫₀¹ f''''(x) η(x) dx + f''(1) η'(1) ]

For the variation to be zero for all admissible η (which must satisfy η(0)=η(1)=0, η'(0)=0), we need the coefficients of η(x) and η'(1) to be zero. Since η'(1) is arbitrary (because η'(1) is not constrained, except that η(1)=0 and η'(0)=0, but η'(1) can vary), the only way for δJ to be zero for all η is if f''''(x) = 0 and f''(1) = 0.

Wait, so the natural boundary conditions here are f''''(x) = 0 and f''(1) = 0. But f''''(x) = 0 is the Euler-Lagrange equation, and the natural boundary condition is f''(1) = 0. However, in our problem, we were given that f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2, but we didn't specify anything about f''(1). Therefore, the minimizer must satisfy f''''(x) = 0 and f''(1) = 0. So now, even though the problem didn't specify f''(1), the minimizer must satisfy f''(1) = 0.

Therefore, the boundary conditions for the minimizer are:

1. f(0) = 0

2. f(1) = 0

3. f'(0) = 2

4. f''(1) = 0

So now, we can solve the differential equation f''''(x) = 0 with these four boundary conditions.

So, starting with f''''(x) = 0, integrating once gives f'''(x) = C₁

Integrate again: f''(x) = C₁ x + C₂

Integrate again: f'(x) = (C₁ / 2) x² + C₂ x + C₃

Integrate again: f(x) = (C₁ / 6) x³ + (C₂ / 2) x² + C₃ x + C₄

Now apply boundary conditions:

1. f(0) = 0 ⇒ C₄ = 0

2. f(1) = 0 ⇒ (C₁ / 6) + (C₂ / 2) + C₃ = 0

3. f'(0) = 2 ⇒ C₃ = 2

4. f''(1) = 0 ⇒ C₁ (1) + C₂ = 0 ⇒ C₁ + C₂ = 0

So now we have the system:

From condition 3: C₃ = 2

From condition 4: C₁ + C₂ = 0 ⇒ C₂ = -C₁

From condition 2: (C₁ / 6) + (C₂ / 2) + 2 = 0

Substitute C₂ = -C₁ into condition 2:

(C₁ / 6) + (-C₁ / 2) + 2 = 0

Compute:

( C₁ / 6 - 3 C₁ / 6 ) + 2 = 0 ⇒ (-2 C₁ / 6) + 2 = 0 ⇒ (-C₁ / 3) + 2 = 0 ⇒ -C₁ / 3 = -2 ⇒ C₁ = 6

Then C₂ = -C₁ = -6

Therefore, the solution is:

f''(x) = 6x - 6

f'(x) = (6/2)x² + (-6)x + 2 = 3x² - 6x + 2

f(x) = (6/6)x³ + (-6/2)x² + 2x + 0 = x³ - 3x² + 2x

Let me check the boundary conditions:

f(0) = 0, f(1) = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0, f'(0) = 0 - 0 + 2 = 2, f''(1) = 6*1 -6 = 0. All good.

Now, compute the integral ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx = ∫₀¹ (6x -6)^2 dx

First, expand (6x -6)^2 = 36x² -72x +36

Integrate term by term:

∫₀¹ 36x² dx = 36*(1/3) = 12

∫₀¹ -72x dx = -72*(1/2) = -36

∫₀¹ 36 dx = 36*1 = 36

Total integral = 12 -36 +36 = 12

Wait, so the minimum value is 12? Let me verify this.

Compute ∫₀¹ (6x -6)^2 dx:

Let’s factor out 36: 36 ∫₀¹ (x -1)^2 dx

Let u = x -1, then du = dx, limits from u=-1 to u=0

But ∫₀¹ (x -1)^2 dx = ∫₋₁⁰ u² du = [u³/3]₋₁⁰ = 0 - (-1/3) = 1/3

Therefore, 36*(1/3) = 12. Yes, same result.

Therefore, the minimum value of the integral is 12. Therefore, the answer should be \\boxed{12}

But wait, let me think again. Is this correct? Let's check the function f(x) = x³ -3x² +2x.

Compute f''(x) = 6x -6, so (f'')² = (6x -6)^2 = 36(x -1)^2. Then integrating from 0 to1:

36 ∫₀¹ (x -1)^2 dx = 36 * [ (x -1)^3 / 3 ] from 0 to1 = 36*(0 - (-1)^3 /3 ) = 36*(1/3) = 12. Correct.

But let me check if this is indeed the minimum. Suppose someone suggests another function that satisfies the boundary conditions but has a lower integral. But according to the calculus of variations, the solution we found is the unique minimizer because the functional is convex (the integrand is (f'')² which is convex in f''). Therefore, this should be the minimum.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using energy minimization. The integral ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx is like the energy of the function, and minimizing it would correspond to the function that is ""smoothest"" under the given constraints. The solution we found is a cubic polynomial, which is the smoothest function (in terms of minimizing the energy) that satisfies the given boundary conditions.

Another way to think about this is to consider the problem as a fourth-order differential equation with four boundary conditions: f(0)=0, f(1)=0, f'(0)=2, and f''(1)=0. Solving this gives the cubic polynomial we found earlier. Therefore, this should be the unique solution, and hence the integral is minimized at 12.

Therefore, I think the answer is 12. Let me just check once more the calculations.

Compute f''(x) = 6x -6

Compute (f'')² = 36x² -72x +36

Integrate from 0 to1:

36x² from 0 to1 is 36*(1/3) =12

-72x from 0 to1 is -72*(1/2) = -36

36*1 =36

Total:12 -36 +36 =12. Yes, correct.

So the minimum value is 12. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{12}

","Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the minimum value of the integral from 0 to 1 of (f''(x))² dx, where f is a twice continuously differentiable function on [0,1], and it has to satisfy f(0) = f(1) = 0 and f'(0) = 2. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you need to minimize an integral involving derivatives of a function, calculus of variations might be the way to go. The problem is asking for the minimum of the integral of the square of the second derivative, which is like an energy functional. So maybe I should set up the Euler-Lagrange equation for this problem.

But wait, the standard Euler-Lagrange equation applies to functionals that depend on the function and its first derivative. In this case, the functional depends on the second derivative. So maybe I need to adjust the approach. Let me recall: if the functional is ∫L(x, f, f', f'') dx, then the Euler-Lagrange equation would involve the derivatives of L with respect to f, f', and f''. But I need to check the exact form.

Alternatively, maybe I can reduce the order of the differential equation. If I let g(x) = f''(x), then the functional becomes ∫₀¹ g(x)² dx. But then, the boundary conditions for g would be related to f. Let me see: f(0) = f(1) = 0, and f'(0) = 2. If I integrate g(x), I get f''(x) = g(x). Then integrating once, f'(x) = ∫g(t) dt + C, and integrating again, f(x) = ∫∫g(t) dt dt + Cx + D. Applying the boundary conditions:

At x=0: f(0) = 0 = D. So D=0.

At x=0: f'(0) = 2 = ∫₀⁰ g(t) dt + C = C. So C=2.

At x=1: f(1) = 0 = ∫₀¹ ∫₀¹ g(t) dt dt + 2*1 + D. Wait, but D is already 0. Wait, maybe I need to write the expressions more carefully.

Wait, maybe I should express f(x) in terms of g(x). Let me think again.

If f''(x) = g(x), then integrating once, f'(x) = ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt + f'(0) = ∫₀ˣ g(t) dt + 2.

Then integrating again, f(x) = ∫₀ˣ (∫₀^s g(t) dt + 2) ds + f(0) = ∫₀ˣ ∫₀^s g(t) dt ds + 2x + 0.

So f(x) = ∫₀ˣ ∫₀^s g(t) dt ds + 2x.

Now, applying the boundary condition f(1) = 0:

0 = ∫₀¹ ∫₀^s g(t) dt ds + 2*1.

So ∫₀¹ ∫₀^s g(t) dt ds = -2.

Hmm, that's a bit complicated. So the problem reduces to finding g(x) such that this double integral of g(t) over t from 0 to s, integrated over s from 0 to 1, equals -2, and then the functional to minimize is ∫₀¹ g(t)² dt.

But maybe this is getting too involved. Perhaps another approach is better.

Alternatively, maybe I can use integration by parts on the original functional. Let's recall that sometimes, for higher derivatives, integrating by parts can reduce the order and incorporate the boundary conditions.

Let me consider the integral ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. If I integrate this, maybe I can express it in terms of f' and f, but since we have squares, maybe not. Wait, but perhaps if I consider the Euler-Lagrange equation for the functional, taking into account the higher derivatives.

The functional is J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx. The Euler-Lagrange equation for such a functional would involve the fourth derivative? Wait, no. Let's recall that for a functional that depends on the second derivative, the Euler-Lagrange equation is a fourth-order ODE. Let me check.

In general, for a functional J[f] = ∫ F(x, f, f', f'', ..., f^{(n)}) dx, the Euler-Lagrange equation is given by:

d/dx (δF/δf^{(k)}) = 0 for each k = 0, 1, ..., n.

But for our case, n=2, so the Euler-Lagrange equation would be:

d/dx (δF/δf'') = 0.

Since F = (f'')², then δF/δf'' = 2f''. Then d/dx (2f'') = 0 => f''''(x) = 0.

So the Euler-Lagrange equation is f''''(x) = 0. Therefore, f''(x) is a linear function, so f(x) is a quartic polynomial. Wait, integrating f''''(x) = 0 gives f'''(x) = C, f''(x) = Cx + D, f'(x) = (C/2)x² + Dx + E, f(x) = (C/6)x³ + (D/2)x² + Ex + F.

But then we have boundary conditions:

f(0) = 0 => F = 0.

f(1) = 0 => (C/6) + (D/2) + E = 0.

f'(0) = 2 => E = 2.

Also, the natural boundary conditions for the Euler-Lagrange equation. Wait, but in calculus of variations, when you have higher derivatives, the natural boundary conditions are related to the variations of the higher derivatives. Hmm, maybe I need to consider them here.

Wait, the original problem doesn't specify any conditions on f''(1) or f'''(1), so perhaps those are free variables? But since we are minimizing the integral of (f''(x))² dx, maybe we can let them be free. So the Euler-Lagrange equation gives f''''(x) = 0, so f''(x) is linear: f''(x) = ax + b.

Then, integrating once: f'(x) = (a/2)x² + bx + c.

Integrating again: f(x) = (a/6)x³ + (b/2)x² + cx + d.

Applying the boundary conditions:

f(0) = 0 => d = 0.

f(1) = 0 => (a/6) + (b/2) + c = 0.

f'(0) = 2 => c = 2.

So substituting c = 2 into the equation for f(1):

(a/6) + (b/2) + 2 = 0 => (a + 3b)/6 + 2 = 0 => a + 3b = -12.

So a = -12 - 3b.

Therefore, f''(x) = ax + b = (-12 - 3b)x + b = -12x - 3b x + b.

Wait, but f''(x) is a linear function. However, we also need to consider the natural boundary conditions. Wait, in calculus of variations for higher-order derivatives, the natural boundary conditions are obtained by considering the variations of the higher derivatives. For example, for the fourth-order problem, the natural boundary conditions would involve f''(0) and f''(1), but since they are not specified here, they are free. However, in our case, since we are minimizing the integral, maybe those should be zero? Wait, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe we can proceed with the quartic polynomial as above, and then see what the integral becomes. Let's see.

Given that f''(x) = ax + b, and a = -12 - 3b, so substituting:

f''(x) = (-12 - 3b)x + b.

Then f(x) = (a/6)x³ + (b/2)x² + 2x.

But since a = -12 - 3b, substituting:

f(x) = [(-12 - 3b)/6]x³ + (b/2)x² + 2x = [ -2 - (b/2) ]x³ + (b/2)x² + 2x.

Then, applying f(1) = 0:

[ -2 - (b/2) ](1) + (b/2)(1) + 2(1) = (-2 - b/2 + b/2) + 2 = (-2) + 2 = 0. Wait, that's automatically satisfied. So regardless of b, f(1)=0 is satisfied. Wait, but how? Let me check:

Wait, f(1) = [ -2 - (b/2) ]*1 + (b/2)*1 + 2*1 = (-2 - b/2 + b/2) + 2 = (-2) + 2 = 0. Yes, it's always zero. So that equation doesn't give any new information. Therefore, the only constraint is a + 3b = -12, but since a = -12 - 3b, there's a relationship between a and b, but b is still a free parameter? Wait, but how?

Wait, but if we have f''(x) = ax + b, and a = -12 - 3b, then f''(x) = (-12 - 3b)x + b. However, the integral we need to minimize is ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx = ∫₀¹ [ (-12 - 3b)x + b ]² dx.

So we can express this integral as a function of b and find the minimum. Let's compute this integral.

Let’s compute the integral:

∫₀¹ [ (-12 - 3b)x + b ]² dx.

First, expand the square:

= ∫₀¹ [ ( (-12 - 3b)x + b )² ] dx

= ∫₀¹ [ ( (-12 - 3b)x + b )² ] dx

Let me denote A = -12 - 3b and B = b, so the expression becomes (A x + B)^2.

Expanding:

= ∫₀¹ (A² x² + 2AB x + B²) dx

= A² ∫₀¹ x² dx + 2AB ∫₀¹ x dx + B² ∫₀¹ dx

Compute each integral:

∫₀¹ x² dx = 1/3,

∫₀¹ x dx = 1/2,

∫₀¹ dx = 1.

So:

= A²*(1/3) + 2AB*(1/2) + B²*1

Simplify:

= (A²)/3 + AB + B².

Now substitute A = -12 - 3b and B = b:

= [ (-12 - 3b)^2 ] / 3 + (-12 - 3b)(b) + b²

Compute each term:

First term: [ (144 + 72b + 9b²) ] / 3 = 48 + 24b + 3b².

Second term: (-12 -3b)(b) = -12b -3b².

Third term: b².

Adding all together:

48 + 24b + 3b² -12b -3b² + b²

Combine like terms:

48 + (24b -12b) + (3b² -3b² + b²)

= 48 + 12b + b².

So the integral becomes 48 + 12b + b². Therefore, we need to minimize the quadratic function 48 + 12b + b² with respect to b.

To find the minimum, take derivative with respect to b:

d/db (48 + 12b + b²) = 12 + 2b.

Set equal to zero:

12 + 2b = 0 => b = -6.

Therefore, the minimum occurs at b = -6. Then, compute the minimal value:

48 + 12*(-6) + (-6)^2 = 48 -72 + 36 = 12.

Wait, so the minimal value of the integral is 12? But let me check my calculations again to be sure.

First, expanding [ (-12 -3b)x + b ]²:

= ( (-12 -3b)x + b )²

= [ (-12 -3b)x + b ]²

= [ - (12 + 3b)x + b ]²

= [ -12x -3b x + b ]²

= [ -12x + b -3b x ]²

= ( -12x + b(1 - 3x) )²

But maybe expanding directly:

= (-12x -3b x + b)^2

= ( -12x -3b x + b )²

= ( -12x + (-3b x + b ) )²

= ( -12x + b(-3x + 1) )²

Then squaring:

= [ -12x + b(1 - 3x) ]²

= ( -12x )² + 2*(-12x)*(b(1 - 3x)) + (b(1 - 3x))²

= 144x² -24b x(1 - 3x) + b²(1 - 3x)^2

Expanding term by term:

First term: 144x².

Second term: -24b x + 72b x².

Third term: b²(1 -6x +9x²) = b² -6b² x +9b² x².

So combining all terms:

144x² -24b x +72b x² + b² -6b² x +9b² x².

Grouping like terms:

x² terms: 144x² +72b x² +9b² x² = x²(144 +72b +9b²).

x terms: -24b x -6b² x = -x(24b +6b²).

Constants: b².

Therefore, integrating from 0 to1:

∫₀¹ [144 +72b +9b²]x² dx - ∫₀¹ (24b +6b²)x dx + ∫₀¹ b² dx

= [144 +72b +9b²] * (1/3) - (24b +6b²)*(1/2) + b²*(1)

= (48 +24b +3b²) - (12b +3b²) + b²

= 48 +24b +3b² -12b -3b² +b²

= 48 +12b +b². Yes, same as before.

So the integral is 48 +12b +b². Then taking derivative with respect to b: 12 +2b. Setting to zero: 12 +2b =0 => b = -6. Then the minimal value is 48 +12*(-6) + (-6)^2 = 48 -72 +36 = 12. So the minimal value is 12. Therefore, the answer is 12. But let me verify if this is correct.

Wait, but the problem states that f is twice continuously differentiable, so f'' exists and is continuous. In our solution, f''(x) = (-12 -3b)x + b. When b = -6, f''(x) = (-12 -3*(-6))x + (-6) = (-12 +18)x -6 = 6x -6. So f''(x) =6x -6. Then integrating f''(x):

f'(x) = 3x² -6x + c. But we have f'(0) =2, so c=2. Then f'(x) =3x² -6x +2.

Integrate again: f(x) =x³ -3x² +2x +d. Since f(0)=0, d=0. Then f(x) =x³ -3x² +2x. Check f(1) =1 -3 +2=0, which is correct. Then f''(x)=6x -6. So (f''(x))² = (6x -6)^2 =36(x -1)^2.

Therefore, the integral from 0 to1 of 36(x-1)^2 dx. Let me compute this integral:

36 ∫₀¹ (x -1)^2 dx =36 ∫₀¹ (x² -2x +1) dx =36 [ (1/3)x³ -x² +x ] from0 to1.

Compute at x=1: 1/3 -1 +1 =1/3.

At x=0:0.

So total integral:36*(1/3)=12. Yes, that's correct. So the minimal value is indeed 12.

But wait, let me check if there are any natural boundary conditions. In the calculus of variations, when dealing with higher-order derivatives, we need to consider natural boundary conditions arising from the variation. Since in our problem, the original functional depends on f''(x), the variations should be considered with appropriate boundary conditions for f and f'. But in our case, the problem only specifies f(0)=f(1)=0 and f'(0)=2. The f'(1) is not specified, and neither are the second derivatives at the boundaries. So perhaps our solution is correct as is.

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach using integration by parts. Let me try that.

Consider the functional J[f] = ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx.

To minimize this, perhaps we can express it in terms of f'(x). Let's integrate by parts with u = f''(x), dv = f''(x) dx. Then du = f'''(x) dx, v = f'(x). But wait, integrating by parts once:

∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx = [f'(x)f''(x)]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ f'(x)f'''(x) dx.

But unless we have conditions on f''(0) and f''(1), this might not help. However, in our problem, we don't have such conditions. But if we proceed further, integrating by parts again:

The term - ∫₀¹ f'(x)f'''(x) dx.

Let me set u = f'(x), dv = f'''(x) dx. Then du = f''(x) dx, v = f''(x). So:

- [f'(x)f''(x)]₀¹ + ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx.

Therefore, the original integral becomes:

[f'(1)f''(1) - f'(0)f''(0)] - [f'(1)f''(1) - f'(0)f''(0)] + ∫₀¹ (f''(x))² dx.

Wait, that seems to lead back to the original integral. Therefore, this approach might not help because it leads to an identity.

Alternatively, maybe consider the Euler-Lagrange equation again. Since the Euler-Lagrange equation gives f''''(x)=0, leading to f''(x) being linear, as we did before, and then proceeding to find the coefficients. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe use the concept of minimizing the energy functional. The integral of (f''(x))² dx resembles the energy associated with the bending of a beam, where f''(x) is the curvature. The minimum energy configuration would be the one that satisfies the boundary conditions and has the least curvature squared. In our case, since we have fixed ends and a fixed slope at one end, the minimal energy solution is a cubic polynomial, which is what we found.

Therefore, I think the answer is 12. So the minimal value is 12, achieved by the function f(x) =x³ -3x² +2x.

**Final Answer**
The minimum value is \\boxed{12}.

Given a non-constant polynomial function \\( f(x) \\) such that \\( f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\) for all \\( x \\), we need to find \\( f(5) \\).

First, we assume \\( f(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial of the form \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\). We compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the given equation.

   - Expanding and simplifying \\( f(z - 2) \\):
     \\[
     f(z - 2) = a(z^3 - 6z^2 + 12z - 8) + b(z^2 - 4z + 4) + c(z - 2) + d
     \\]
     \\[
     = az^3 - 6az^2 + 12az - 8a + bz^2 - 4bz + 4b + cz - 2c + d
     \\]
   - Subtracting \\( f(z - 2) \\) from \\( f(z) \\):
     \\[
     f(z) - f(z - 2) = 6az^2 + (-12a + 4b)z + 8a - 4b + 2c
     \\]

2. **Substitute \\( z = x^3 \\)**:
   - LHS becomes \\( 6ax^6 + (-12a + 4b)x^3 + 8a - 4b + 2c \\).

3. **Expand \\( [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\)**:

","Okay, let's see. I need to find f(5) given that f is a non-constant polynomial function satisfying the equation f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12 for all x. Hmm, polynomials can sometimes be solved by comparing degrees or plugging in specific values. Let me start by analyzing the equation.

First, since f is a polynomial, let's think about its degree. Let’s suppose f(x) is a polynomial of degree n. Then f(x³) would have degree 3n, and the left-hand side (LHS) of the equation is f(x³) - f(x³ - 2). The difference between two polynomials of the same degree would result in a polynomial of degree less than 3n unless the leading terms cancel out. But here, since f(x³) and f(x³ - 2) both have the same leading term when expanded (since shifting x³ by 2 doesn't affect the highest power term), their difference would start with the next lower degree term. 

On the right-hand side (RHS), [f(x)]² is a polynomial of degree 2n. Therefore, equating the degrees from LHS and RHS, we have 3n - 1 = 2n. Solving for n gives n = 1. Wait, but if n=1, then f(x) is linear. Let me check if that works.

Suppose f(x) = ax + b. Then f(x³) = a x³ + b, and f(x³ - 2) = a (x³ - 2) + b = a x³ - 2a + b. Subtracting these gives f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = (a x³ + b) - (a x³ - 2a + b) = 2a. On the RHS, [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x + b)² + 12 = a² x² + 2ab x + b² + 12. For these two expressions to be equal for all x, the LHS is a constant (2a) and the RHS is quadratic. The only way a quadratic can equal a constant is if the coefficients of x² and x are zero. So, a² = 0 and 2ab = 0. Since f is non-constant, a ≠ 0, but a² = 0 implies a = 0, which is a contradiction. Therefore, f(x) cannot be linear. So my initial assumption that n=1 must be wrong. That means my degree analysis might be incorrect.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the degree comparison. Let me re-examine. The LHS is f(x³) - f(x³ - 2). If f is degree n, then f(x³) is degree 3n. The difference f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) would have leading term equal to the leading term of f(x³) minus the leading term of f(x³ - 2). But since f(x³ - 2) is f evaluated at x³ - 2, expanding that would give a polynomial in x³ with terms shifted. For example, if f(x) = ax^n + ... then f(x³ - 2) = a(x³ - 2)^n + ... The leading term would be a x^{3n} (since (x³)^n = x^{3n}), same as f(x³). Therefore, when subtracting f(x³ - 2) from f(x³), the leading terms cancel out, so the next term would be the next highest degree term. For example, if f(x) = ax^n + bx^{n-1} + ..., then f(x³) = a x^{3n} + b x^{3(n-1)} + ..., and f(x³ - 2) = a (x³ - 2)^n + ... which would expand to a x^{3n} - 2n a x^{3n - 1} + ... So the difference would be 2n a x^{3n - 1} + ... Therefore, the LHS is a polynomial of degree 3n - 1.

On the RHS, [f(x)]² is degree 2n. Therefore, setting 3n - 1 = 2n gives n = 1. But we saw that n=1 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, maybe there's another approach.

Alternatively, perhaps f(x) is a quadratic polynomial. Let me try assuming f(x) is quadratic. Let’s suppose f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then f(x³) = a x^6 + b x³ + c, and f(x³ - 2) = a (x³ - 2)^2 + b (x³ - 2) + c. Let's compute that:

Expanding (x³ - 2)^2: x^6 - 4x³ + 4. So f(x³ - 2) = a x^6 - 4a x³ + 4a + b x³ - 2b + c.

Subtracting f(x³ - 2) from f(x³):

LHS = [a x^6 + b x³ + c] - [a x^6 - 4a x³ + 4a + b x³ - 2b + c] = (a x^6 - a x^6) + (b x³ + 4a x³ - b x³) + (c - 4a - (-2b) - c) = 4a x³ + (-4a - 2b).

On the RHS, [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x² + b x + c)^2 + 12. Expanding this:

= a² x^4 + 2ab x³ + (2ac + b²) x² + 2bc x + c² + 12.

But the LHS is 4a x³ + (-4a - 2b), which is a cubic polynomial. However, the RHS is a quartic polynomial (degree 4) unless a² = 0. But if a ≠ 0 (since quadratic), then 4a x³ must equal the RHS's x³ term. But the RHS's x³ term is 2ab x³, so 4a = 2ab. If a ≠ 0, then 4 = 2b => b = 2. Then, the x² term on RHS is 2ac + b² x². But the LHS has no x² term, so 2ac + b² = 0. Since b=2, this becomes 2ac + 4 = 0 => ac = -2. The x term on RHS is 2bc x. But LHS has no x term, so 2bc = 0. Since b=2, this implies c=0. Then from ac = -2, with c=0, we get a*0 = -2, which is impossible. Therefore, quadratic also doesn't work.

Hmm, maybe cubic? Let's try f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Then f(x³) = a x^9 + b x^6 + c x³ + d. Then f(x³ - 2) would be a (x³ - 2)^3 + b (x³ - 2)^2 + c (x³ - 2) + d. Let's expand each term:

First, (x³ - 2)^3 = x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x³ - 8.

Then (x³ - 2)^2 = x^6 - 4x³ + 4.

So f(x³ - 2) = a(x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x³ - 8) + b(x^6 - 4x³ + 4) + c(x³ - 2) + d.

Expanding that:

= a x^9 - 6a x^6 + 12a x³ - 8a + b x^6 - 4b x³ + 4b + c x³ - 2c + d.

Combine like terms:

= a x^9 + (-6a + b) x^6 + (12a - 4b + c) x³ + (-8a + 4b - 2c + d).

Subtracting f(x³ - 2) from f(x³):

LHS = [a x^9 + b x^6 + c x³ + d] - [a x^9 + (-6a + b) x^6 + (12a - 4b + c) x³ + (-8a + 4b - 2c + d)]

Compute term by term:

- x^9: a x^9 - a x^9 = 0
- x^6: b x^6 - (-6a + b) x^6 = b + 6a - b = 6a x^6
- x³: c x³ - (12a - 4b + c) x³ = c -12a +4b -c = (-12a +4b) x³
- constants: d - (-8a +4b -2c +d) = d +8a -4b +2c -d = 8a -4b +2c

So LHS = 6a x^6 + (-12a +4b) x³ + (8a -4b +2c).

On the RHS, [f(x)]² + 12. Let's compute [f(x)]²:

= (ax³ + bx² + cx + d)^2 = a² x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b²) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x³ + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + d².

Adding 12 gives RHS = a² x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b²) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x³ + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + (d² +12).

Now, equate LHS and RHS:

LHS: 6a x^6 + (-12a +4b) x³ + (8a -4b +2c)

RHS: a² x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b²) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x³ + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + (d² +12)

For these two polynomials to be equal for all x, the coefficients of corresponding powers of x must be equal. Let's set up equations:

1. Coefficient of x^6: 6a = a² → a² -6a =0 → a(a -6)=0. So a=0 or a=6. But f is non-constant, so a ≠0. Therefore, a=6.

2. Coefficient of x^5: 0 = 2ab. Since a=6, this gives 0=12b → b=0.

3. Coefficient of x^4: 0 = 2ac + b². With a=6, b=0, this becomes 0=12c +0 → c=0.

4. Coefficient of x³: -12a +4b = 2ad + 2bc. Substitute a=6, b=0, c=0:

Left: -12*6 +4*0 = -72

Right: 2*6*d + 2*0*0 =12d

So -72=12d → d= -6.

5. Coefficient of x²: 0 = 2bd + c². With b=0, c=0, this is 0=0 +0 → okay.

6. Coefficient of x: 0 = 2cd. With c=0, this is 0=0 → okay.

7. Constant term: 8a -4b +2c = d² +12. Substitute a=6, b=0, c=0, d=-6:

Left: 8*6 -0 +0=48

Right: (-6)^2 +12=36 +12=48

So all equations are satisfied. Therefore, the polynomial is f(x)=6x³ +0x² +0x +(-6)=6x³ -6.

So f(x)=6x³ -6. Let me check if this works.

First, compute f(x³) - f(x³ -2):

f(x³)=6(x³)^3 -6=6x^9 -6.

f(x³ -2)=6(x³ -2)^3 -6.

First expand (x³ -2)^3 =x^9 -6x^6 +12x³ -8.

So f(x³ -2)=6(x^9 -6x^6 +12x³ -8) -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -48 -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54.

Then f(x³)-f(x³ -2)= (6x^9 -6) - (6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54)=6x^9 -6 -6x^9 +36x^6 -72x³ +54=36x^6 -72x³ +48.

Now compute [f(x)]² +12:

f(x)=6x³ -6, so [f(x)]²=(6x³ -6)^2=36x^6 -72x³ +36. Adding 12 gives 36x^6 -72x³ +48. Which matches the LHS. Therefore, the equation holds.

Therefore, f(x)=6x³ -6 is the polynomial satisfying the given equation. Now, we need to find f(5).

Compute f(5)=6*(5)^3 -6=6*125 -6=750 -6=744.

Wait, but the original problem says ""Given a non-constant polynomial function f(x) ... find f(5)."" So according to this, the answer is 744. But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with polynomials, especially with high degrees, it's easy to make a mistake.

Let me verify f(x)=6x³ -6 again. Let's check for a specific x value, say x=1.

Compute f(1)=6*1 -6=0.

Compute LHS: f(1³) - f(1³ -2)=f(1)-f(-1)=0 - f(-1)= -[6*(-1)^3 -6]= -[ -6 -6 ]=12.

RHS: [f(1)]² +12=0 +12=12. So that works.

Another test: x=0.

f(0³)-f(0³ -2)=f(0)-f(-2)= (-6) - [6*(-2)^3 -6]= -6 - [6*(-8) -6]= -6 - (-48 -6)= -6 +54=48.

RHS: [f(0)]² +12= (-6)^2 +12=36+12=48. Correct.

Another test: x=2.

f(8) - f(8 -2)=f(8) -f(6)= [6*512 -6] - [6*216 -6] = (3072 -6) - (1296 -6) =3066 -1290=1776.

RHS: [f(2)]² +12= [6*8 -6]^2 +12= [48 -6]^2 +12=42² +12=1764 +12=1776. Correct.

So all test cases check out. Therefore, f(x)=6x³ -6 is indeed the correct polynomial, and f(5)=6*(125) -6=750-6=744.

Given a non-constant polynomial function \\( f(x) \\) such that \\( f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\) for all \\( x \\), we need to find \\( f(5) \\).

First, we assume \\( f(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial of the form \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\). We compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the given equation.

1. **Compute \\( f(z) - f(z - 2) \\)**:
   - \\( f(z) = az^3 + bz^2 + cz + d \\)
   - \\( f(z - 2) = a(z - 2)^3 + b(z - 2)^2 + c(z - 2) + d \\)
   - Expanding and simplifying \\( f(z - 2) \\):
     \\[
     f(z - 2) = a(z^3 - 6z^2 + 12z - 8) + b(z^2 - 4z + 4) + c(z - 2) + d
     \\]
     \\[
     = az^3 - 6az^2 + 12az - 8a + bz^2 - 4bz + 4b + cz - 2c + d
     \\]
   - Subtracting \\( f(z - 2) \\) from \\( f(z) \\):
     \\[
     f(z) - f(z - 2) = 6az^2 + (-12a + 4b)z + 8a - 4b + 2c
     \\]

2. **Substitute \\( z = x^3 \\)**:
   - LHS becomes \\( 6ax^6 + (-12a + 4b)x^3 + 8a - 4b + 2c \\).

3. **Expand \\( [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\)**:
   - \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\)
   - \\( [f(x)]^2 = (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)^2 \\)
   - Expanding and simplifying:
     \\[
     [f(x)]^2 + 12 = a^2x^6 + 2abx^5 + (2ac + b^2)x^4 + (2ad + 2bc)x^3 + (2bd + c^2)x^2 + 2cdx + d^2 + 12
     \\]

4. **Equate coefficients**:
   - For \\( x^6 \\): \\( 6a = a^2 \\) gives \\( a = 6 \\).
   - For \\( x^5 \\): \\( 2ab = 0 \\) gives \\( b = 0 \\).
   - For \\( x^4 \\): \\( 2ac + b^2 = 0 \\) gives \\( c = 0 \\).
   - For \\( x^3 \\): \\( -12a + 4b = 2ad + 2bc \\) gives \\( d = -6 \\).
   - Constants: \\( 8a - 4b + 2c = d^2 + 12 \\) confirms \\( d = -6 \\).

Thus, the polynomial is \\( f(x) = 6x^3 - 6 \\).

Finally, we compute \\( f(5) \\):
\\[
f(5) = 6(5)^3 - 6 = 6 \\cdot 125 - 6 = 750 - 6 = 744
\\]

\\[

","Okay, so I need to find f(5) where f is a non-constant polynomial that satisfies the equation f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12 for all x. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this equation is saying. Maybe I can plug in some specific values for x to simplify things. 

First, since the equation has to hold for all x, perhaps choosing x such that x³ is a particular value might help. Let me think. If I set x = 1, then x³ = 1. So the left-hand side becomes f(1) - f(1 - 2) = f(1) - f(-1). The right-hand side is [f(1)]² + 12. So f(1) - f(-1) = [f(1)]² + 12. That gives me an equation involving f(1) and f(-1). But I don't know what those values are yet. Maybe I need more equations.

Alternatively, maybe I can assume that f is a quadratic or cubic polynomial. Since it's non-constant, maybe it's linear? Wait, but let's check. Suppose f is linear. Let's say f(x) = ax + b. Then let's compute both sides.

Left-hand side: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = a(x³) + b - [a(x³ - 2) + b] = a x³ + b - a x³ + 2a - b = 2a.

Right-hand side: [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x + b)² + 12 = a² x² + 2ab x + b² + 12.

So equating left and right: 2a = a² x² + 2ab x + b² + 12. But the left-hand side is a constant, and the right-hand side is a quadratic in x unless a = 0. But if a = 0, then f is constant, which is not allowed. So f can't be linear. Therefore, f must be of higher degree.

Let me try quadratic. Let f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then compute both sides.

Left-hand side: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = a(x³)² + b(x³) + c - [a(x³ - 2)² + b(x³ - 2) + c]

Compute each term:

a(x³)² = a x⁶

b(x³) = b x³

c - [a(x³ - 2)² + b(x³ - 2) + c] = -a(x⁶ - 4x³ + 4) - b(x³ - 2) - c + c

Wait, let's expand that step by step.

First, expand (x³ - 2)²: x⁶ - 4x³ + 4.

So, -a(x³ - 2)² = -a x⁶ + 4a x³ - 4a.

Then, -b(x³ - 2) = -b x³ + 2b.

Adding the -c and +c cancels out, so total left-hand side:

a x⁶ + b x³ + c - a x⁶ + 4a x³ - 4a - b x³ + 2b - c

Simplify term by term:

a x⁶ - a x⁶ = 0

b x³ + 4a x³ - b x³ = 4a x³

c - c = 0

-4a + 2b

So overall left-hand side is 4a x³ -4a + 2b.

Right-hand side: [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x² + b x + c)² + 12. Let's expand that:

a² x⁴ + 2ab x³ + (2ac + b²) x² + 2bc x + c² + 12.

Set left-hand side equal to right-hand side:

4a x³ -4a + 2b = a² x⁴ + 2ab x³ + (2ac + b²) x² + 2bc x + c² + 12.

But the left-hand side has no x⁴, x², x terms, and the coefficients of x³, x⁴, etc. must match. So:

For x⁴ term: 0 = a² ⇒ a = 0. But if a = 0, then f is linear, which we already saw cannot satisfy the equation. Therefore, quadratic also doesn't work.

So f must be of higher degree. Let's try cubic. Let f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Then compute both sides.

Left-hand side: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = a(x³)³ + b(x³)² + c(x³) + d - [a(x³ - 2)³ + b(x³ - 2)² + c(x³ - 2) + d]

Compute each term:

a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d - [a(x³ - 2)³ + b(x³ - 2)² + c(x³ - 2) + d]

First, expand (x³ - 2)³:

= x⁹ - 6x⁶ + 12x³ - 8

(x³ - 2)² = x⁶ - 4x³ + 4

So, expanding the terms inside the brackets:

- a(x⁹ - 6x⁶ + 12x³ -8) - b(x⁶ -4x³ +4) - c(x³ -2) -d

= -a x⁹ +6a x⁶ -12a x³ +8a -b x⁶ +4b x³ -4b -c x³ +2c -d

Now combine with the left-hand side:

Original left-hand side was a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d - [ ... ] which becomes:

a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d - (-a x⁹ +6a x⁶ -12a x³ +8a -b x⁶ +4b x³ -4b -c x³ +2c -d )

Wait, maybe better to compute step by step:

Left-hand side = f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d] - [a(x³ -2)^3 + b(x³ -2)^2 + c(x³ -2) + d]

So expanding the second term:

= [a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d] - [a(x⁹ -6x⁶ +12x³ -8) + b(x⁶ -4x³ +4) + c(x³ -2) + d]

= [a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d] - [a x⁹ -6a x⁶ +12a x³ -8a + b x⁶ -4b x³ +4b + c x³ -2c + d]

Now distribute the negative sign:

= a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d - a x⁹ +6a x⁶ -12a x³ +8a -b x⁶ +4b x³ -4b -c x³ +2c -d

Now combine like terms:

a x⁹ - a x⁹ = 0

b x⁶ +6a x⁶ -b x⁶ = (6a) x⁶

c x³ -12a x³ +4b x³ -c x³ = (-12a +4b) x³

d - (-8a +4b +2c -d) Wait no, let's check:

Wait, the constants:

Original d - [ -8a +4b + (-2c) +d ]

Wait, no:

Wait, the expanded expression is:

After distributing the negative sign:

= a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d - a x⁹ +6a x⁶ -12a x³ +8a -b x⁶ +4b x³ -4b -c x³ +2c -d

So constants:

d +8a -4b +2c -d = 8a -4b +2c

So putting it all together:

Left-hand side = 6a x⁶ + (-12a +4b) x³ + (8a -4b +2c)

Now the right-hand side is [f(x)]² +12. Let's compute that.

f(x) = a x³ + b x² + c x + d

[f(x)]² = (a x³ + b x² + c x + d)^2

= a² x⁶ + 2ab x⁵ + (2ac + b²) x⁴ + (2ad + 2bc) x³ + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + d²

Then +12, so right-hand side is:

a² x⁶ + 2ab x⁵ + (2ac + b²) x⁴ + (2ad + 2bc) x³ + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + (d² +12)

Set equal to left-hand side:

6a x⁶ + (-12a +4b) x³ + (8a -4b +2c) = a² x⁶ + 2ab x⁵ + (2ac + b²) x⁴ + (2ad + 2bc) x³ + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + (d² +12)

Now, equate coefficients for each power of x:

x⁶: 6a = a² ⇒ a² -6a =0 ⇒ a(a -6)=0 ⇒ a=0 or a=6. But since f is non-constant, a=6.

x⁵: 0 = 2ab. Since a=6, this becomes 0=12b ⇒ b=0.

x⁴: 0 = 2ac + b². Since b=0, this becomes 0=2*6*c +0 ⇒ 12c=0 ⇒ c=0.

x³: -12a +4b = 2ad + 2bc. Plugging a=6, b=0, c=0:

Left side: -12*6 +4*0 = -72

Right side: 2*6*d + 2*0*0 = 12d

Thus: -72 =12d ⇒ d= -6.

x²: 0 = 2bd + c². Since b=0, c=0, this is 0=0+0=0, okay.

x term: 0 = 2cd. Since c=0, d=-6, this is 0=0, okay.

Constants: 8a -4b +2c = d² +12. Plugging a=6, b=0, c=0, d=-6:

Left: 8*6 -0 +0=48

Right: (-6)^2 +12=36+12=48. Okay, that works.

So all coefficients match. Therefore, the polynomial is f(x) =6x³ +0x² +0x +(-6)=6x³ -6.

Therefore, f(x)=6x³ -6. Let me check if this satisfies the original equation.

Compute f(x³) - f(x³ -2):

f(x³)=6(x³)^3 -6=6x^9 -6

f(x³ -2)=6(x³ -2)^3 -6

Compute (x³ -2)^3: x^9 -6x^6 +12x³ -8

Thus, f(x³ -2)=6(x^9 -6x^6 +12x³ -8) -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -48 -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54

Therefore, f(x³) -f(x³ -2)= [6x^9 -6] - [6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54] =6x^9 -6 -6x^9 +36x^6 -72x³ +54=36x^6 -72x³ +48

On the other side, [f(x)]² +12:

f(x)=6x³ -6, so [f(x)]²=(6x³ -6)^2=36x^6 -72x³ +36

Add 12:36x^6 -72x³ +36 +12=36x^6 -72x³ +48

Which matches the left-hand side. So yes, f(x)=6x³ -6 satisfies the equation.

Therefore, f(5)=6*(5)^3 -6=6*125 -6=750 -6=744.

Wait, but the problem statement mentions ""Given a non-constant polynomial function f(x) such that f(x³) - f(x³ -2) = [f(x)]² +12 for all x, find f(5)."" So according to my solution, the answer is 744.

But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculation. Let's verify f(5):

f(5)=6*(5)^3 -6=6*125 -6=750 -6=744. Yes, that's correct.

But let me check if there's another possible polynomial. Wait, in the process above, when we assumed f is cubic, we found a unique solution. Since the equation must hold for all x, and we matched all coefficients, that should be the only solution. Therefore, f(x)=6x³ -6 is the unique polynomial satisfying the given equation, so f(5)=744.

But wait, the problem statement says ""non-constant polynomial"", which our solution satisfies. So I think that's the answer.

2. **Substitute \\( z = x^3 \\)**:
   - LHS becomes \\( 6ax^6 + (-12a + 4b)x^3 + 8a - 4b + 2c \\).

3. **Expand \\( [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\)**:

","Okay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is about finding \\( f(5) \\) for a non-constant polynomial function \\( f(x) \\) that satisfies the equation \\( f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\) for all \\( x \\). Hmm, polynomials can sometimes be tricky, but maybe we can figure out the degree of \\( f \\) first. Let's think.

First, since \\( f(x) \\) is a polynomial, let's assume its degree is \\( n \\). Then, \\( f(x^3) \\) would have degree \\( 3n \\), right? Similarly, \\( f(x^3 - 2) \\) would also have degree \\( 3n \\) because shifting \\( x^3 \\) by a constant doesn't change its degree. On the right-hand side, \\( [f(x)]^2 \\) would have degree \\( 2n \\). So, comparing the left and right sides, the highest degree on the left is \\( 3n \\), and on the right is \\( 2n \\). For these to be equal for all \\( x \\), the coefficients of the highest degree terms must match. Therefore, \\( 3n = 2n \\), which implies \\( n = 0 \\). But wait, the problem states that \\( f(x) \\) is non-constant, so \\( n \\) cannot be zero. That's a contradiction. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the leading terms on the left-hand side cancel out? Let me check again. If \\( f(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial, \\( n = 3 \\), then \\( f(x^3) \\) would be degree \\( 9 \\), and \\( f(x^3 - 2) \\) would be degree \\( 9 \\). Then, \\( [f(x)]^2 \\) would be degree \\( 6 \\). So, again, the left-hand side is degree \\( 9 \\), right-hand side is degree \\( 6 \\). Not matching. Similarly, if \\( f(x) \\) is quadratic, degree \\( 2 \\), then left-hand side is degree \\( 6 \\), right-hand side is degree \\( 4 \\). Still no match. If \\( f(x) \\) is linear, degree \\( 1 \\), left-hand side is degree \\( 3 \\), right-hand side is degree \\( 2 \\). Not matching. So this suggests that perhaps there is no solution? But the problem says ""given a non-constant polynomial function \\( f(x) \\)"", so there must be a solution. Maybe my initial assumption about the degree is wrong?

Wait, maybe the difference \\( f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) \\) simplifies in some way. Let's suppose \\( f(x) \\) is a quadratic polynomial. Let me test that. Let \\( f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \\). Then, \\( f(x^3) = a(x^3)^2 + b(x^3) + c = ax^6 + bx^3 + c \\). Similarly, \\( f(x^3 - 2) = a(x^3 - 2)^2 + b(x^3 - 2) + c = a(x^6 - 4x^3 + 4) + b(x^3 - 2) + c = ax^6 - 4a x^3 + 4a + b x^3 - 2b + c \\). Then, subtracting: \\( f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = [ax^6 + bx^3 + c] - [ax^6 - 4a x^3 + 4a + b x^3 - 2b + c] \\). Simplify: \\( ax^6 - ax^6 + bx^3 + 4a x^3 - b x^3 + c - 4a - c + 2b \\). So, that's \\( (b + 4a - b)x^3 + (c - c) + (-4a + 2b) \\). So, the difference is \\( 4a x^3 + (-4a + 2b) \\).

On the right-hand side, \\( [f(x)]^2 + 12 = (ax^2 + bx + c)^2 + 12 = a^2 x^4 + 2ab x^3 + (2ac + b^2) x^2 + 2bc x + (c^2 + 12) \\).

Now, setting the left-hand side equal to the right-hand side, we have:

Left: \\( 4a x^3 + (-4a + 2b) \\)

Right: \\( a^2 x^4 + 2ab x^3 + (2ac + b^2) x^2 + 2bc x + (c^2 + 12) \\)

For these polynomials to be equal for all \\( x \\), all corresponding coefficients must be equal. Let's set them equal term by term:

For \\( x^4 \\): Left has 0, Right has \\( a^2 \\). So, \\( a^2 = 0 \\implies a = 0 \\). But if \\( a = 0 \\), then \\( f(x) \\) is linear, which contradicts our assumption that it's quadratic. Hence, no solution for quadratic.

Similarly, let's try cubic. Let \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\).

Compute \\( f(x^3) = a(x^3)^3 + b(x^3)^2 + c(x^3) + d = a x^9 + b x^6 + c x^3 + d \\).

Compute \\( f(x^3 - 2) \\). Let's expand \\( (x^3 - 2)^3 = x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x^3 - 8 \\). So,

\\( f(x^3 - 2) = a(x^3 - 2)^3 + b(x^3 - 2)^2 + c(x^3 - 2) + d \\)

= \\( a(x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x^3 - 8) + b(x^6 - 4x^3 + 4) + c(x^3 - 2) + d \\)

= \\( a x^9 - 6a x^6 + 12a x^3 - 8a + b x^6 - 4b x^3 + 4b + c x^3 - 2c + d \\)

Now, subtract \\( f(x^3 - 2) \\) from \\( f(x^3) \\):

Left-hand side:

\\( [a x^9 + b x^6 + c x^3 + d] - [a x^9 - 6a x^6 + 12a x^3 - 8a + b x^6 - 4b x^3 + 4b + c x^3 - 2c + d] \\)

Simplify term by term:

- \\( a x^9 - a x^9 = 0 \\)
- \\( b x^6 + 6a x^6 - b x^6 = 6a x^6 \\)
- \\( c x^3 - 12a x^3 + 4b x^3 - c x^3 = (-12a + 4b) x^3 \\)
- Constants: \\( d + 8a - 4b + 2c - d = 8a -4b + 2c \\)

So overall, left-hand side is \\( 6a x^6 + (-12a + 4b) x^3 + (8a -4b + 2c) \\)

Right-hand side is \\( [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\). Let's compute \\( [f(x)]^2 \\):

\\( (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)^2 = a^2 x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b^2) x^4 + 2(ad + bc) x^3 + (2bd + c^2) x^2 + 2cd x + d^2 \\)

Adding 12, the right-hand side becomes:

\\( a^2 x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b^2) x^4 + 2(ad + bc) x^3 + (2bd + c^2) x^2 + 2cd x + (d^2 + 12) \\)

Now, set left-hand side equal to right-hand side:

Left: \\( 6a x^6 + (-12a + 4b) x^3 + (8a -4b + 2c) \\)

Right: \\( a^2 x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b^2) x^4 + 2(ad + bc) x^3 + (2bd + c^2) x^2 + 2cd x + (d^2 + 12) \\)

Equating coefficients term by term:

- \\( x^6 \\): \\( 6a = a^2 \\)
- \\( x^5 \\): \\( 0 = 2ab \\)
- \\( x^4 \\): \\( 0 = 2ac + b^2 \\)
- \\( x^3 \\): \\( -12a + 4b = 2(ad + bc) \\)
- \\( x^2 \\): \\( 0 = 2bd + c^2 \\)
- \\( x \\): \\( 0 = 2cd \\)
- Constant term: \\( 8a -4b + 2c = d^2 + 12 \\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From \\( x^5 \\): \\( 2ab = 0 \\implies ab = 0 \\). So either \\( a = 0 \\) or \\( b = 0 \\).

But \\( f(x) \\) is non-constant and cubic, so \\( a \\neq 0 \\). Therefore, \\( b = 0 \\).

From \\( x^4 \\): \\( 2ac + b^2 = 0 \\). Since \\( b = 0 \\), this becomes \\( 2ac = 0 \\). Since \\( a \\neq 0 \\), \\( c = 0 \\).

From \\( x^2 \\): \\( 2bd + c^2 = 0 \\). Again, \\( b = 0 \\), \\( c = 0 \\), so \\( 0 + 0 = 0 \\). Okay, no problem.

From \\( x \\): \\( 2cd = 0 \\). \\( c = 0 \\), so this is satisfied regardless of \\( d \\).

Now, back to \\( x^6 \\): \\( 6a = a^2 \\implies a^2 -6a =0 \\implies a(a -6) =0 \\). Since \\( a \\neq 0 \\), \\( a =6 \\).

So far, we have \\( a =6 \\), \\( b=0 \\), \\( c=0 \\).

Now, \\( x^3 \\): \\( -12a +4b = 2(ad + bc) \\). Plugging in \\( a=6 \\), \\( b=0 \\), \\( c=0 \\):

Left: \\( -12*6 +0 = -72 \\)

Right: \\( 2*(6*d +0*0) = 2*6d =12d \\)

So, \\( -72 =12d \\implies d = -6 \\).

Finally, the constant term: \\( 8a -4b +2c = d^2 +12 \\). Plugging in:

Left: \\( 8*6 -0 +0 =48 \\)

Right: \\( (-6)^2 +12 =36 +12=48 \\). Perfect, it checks out.

So, the polynomial is \\( f(x) =6x^3 +0x^2 +0x -6 =6x^3 -6 \\).

Let me verify if this function satisfies the original equation \\( f(x^3) -f(x^3 -2) = [f(x)]^2 +12 \\).

Compute \\( f(x^3) =6(x^3)^3 -6=6x^9 -6 \\)

Compute \\( f(x^3 -2) =6(x^3 -2)^3 -6 \\)

First, compute \\( (x^3 -2)^3 =x^9 -6x^6 +12x^3 -8 \\)

Multiply by 6: \\(6x^9 -36x^6 +72x^3 -48 \\)

Subtract 6: \\(6x^9 -36x^6 +72x^3 -48 -6 =6x^9 -36x^6 +72x^3 -54 \\)

Now, subtract \\( f(x^3 -2) \\) from \\( f(x^3) \\):

\\( (6x^9 -6) - (6x^9 -36x^6 +72x^3 -54) \\)

= \\(6x^9 -6 -6x^9 +36x^6 -72x^3 +54 \\)

= \\(36x^6 -72x^3 +48 \\)

Now, compute \\( [f(x)]^2 +12 \\):

\\( (6x^3 -6)^2 +12 = (36x^6 -72x^3 +36) +12 =36x^6 -72x^3 +48 \\)

Which matches the left-hand side. So, yes, this polynomial works. Therefore, \\( f(x) =6x^3 -6 \\).

Now, the question is to find \\( f(5) \\). Let's compute that:

\\( f(5) =6*(5)^3 -6 =6*125 -6 =750 -6 =744 \\).

Wait, but the problem mentions ""non-constant polynomial function \\( f(x) \\)"" and gives the equation. According to my calculations, \\( f(x) =6x^3 -6 \\). Then, \\( f(5) =744 \\). But let me double-check the steps to ensure I didn't make any errors.

Starting from the polynomial assumption, we found that the cubic polynomial works. Checked the coefficients step by step, substituted back into the original equation, and verified that both sides are equal. Then, computed \\( f(5) \\) as 744. Seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let's check another value. For example, let's take \\( x=0 \\). Compute both sides.

Left-hand side: \\( f(0^3) -f(0^3 -2) =f(0) -f(-2) = (6*0 -6) - (6*(-2)^3 -6) = (-6) - (6*(-8) -6) = -6 - (-48 -6) = -6 - (-54) = -6 +54=48.

Right-hand side: [f(0)]^2 +12 = (-6)^2 +12=36+12=48. So, that works.

Another check: \\( x=1 \\).

Left: \\( f(1) -f(1 -2)=f(1) -f(-1)= (6*1 -6) - (6*(-1)^3 -6)= (0) - (6*(-1) -6)= -(-6 -6)= -(-12)=12.

Right: [f(1)]^2 +12=0^2 +12=12. Correct.

Another check: \\( x=2 \\).

Left: \\( f(8) -f(8-2)=f(8)-f(6)= (6*512 -6) - (6*216 -6)= (3072 -6)-(1296 -6)=3066 -1290=1776.

Right: [f(2)]^2 +12=(6*8 -6)^2 +12=(48-6)^2 +12=42^2 +12=1764 +12=1776. Correct again.

So all checks out. Therefore, \\( f(5) =744 \\).

Given a non-constant polynomial function \\( f(x) \\) such that \\( f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\) for all \\( x \\), we need to find \\( f(5) \\).

First, we assume \\( f(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial of the form \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\). We compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the given equation.

1. **Compute \\( f(z) - f(z - 2) \\)**:
   - \\( f(z) = az^3 + bz^2 + cz + d \\)
   - \\( f(z - 2) = a(z - 2)^3 + b(z - 2)^2 + c(z - 2) + d \\)
   - Expanding and simplifying \\( f(z - 2) \\):
     \\[
     f(z - 2) = a(z^3 - 6z^2 + 12z - 8) + b(z^2 - 4z + 4) + c(z - 2) + d
     \\]
     \\[
     = az^3 - 6az^2 + 12az - 8a + bz^2 - 4bz + 4b + cz - 2c + d
     \\]
   - Subtracting \\( f(z - 2) \\) from \\( f(z) \\):
     \\[
     f(z) - f(z - 2) = 6az^2 + (-12a + 4b)z + 8a - 4b + 2c
     \\]

2. **Substitute \\( z = x^3 \\)**:
   - LHS becomes \\( 6ax^6 + (-12a + 4b)x^3 + 8a - 4b + 2c \\).

3. **Expand \\( [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\)**:
   - \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\)
   - \\( [f(x)]^2 = (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)^2 \\)
   - Expanding and simplifying:
     \\[
     [f(x)]^2 + 12 = a^2x^6 + 2abx^5 + (2ac + b^2)x^4 + (2ad + 2bc)x^3 + (2bd + c^2)x^2 + 2cdx + d^2 + 12
     \\]

4. **Equate coefficients**:
   - For \\( x^6 \\): \\( 6a = a^2 \\) gives \\( a = 6 \\).
   - For \\( x^5 \\): \\( 2ab = 0 \\) gives \\( b = 0 \\).
   - For \\( x^4 \\): \\( 2ac + b^2 = 0 \\) gives \\( c = 0 \\).
   - For \\( x^3 \\): \\( -12a + 4b = 2ad + 2bc \\) gives \\( d = -6 \\).
   - Constants: \\( 8a - 4b + 2c = d^2 + 12 \\) confirms \\( d = -6 \\).

Thus, the polynomial is \\( f(x) = 6x^3 - 6 \\).

Finally, we compute \\( f(5) \\):
\\[
f(5) = 6(5)^3 - 6 = 6 \\cdot 125 - 6 = 750 - 6 = 744
\\]

\\[
\\boxed{744}

","Okay, so I need to find f(5) where f(x) is a non-constant polynomial that satisfies the equation f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = [f(x)]^2 + 12 for all x. Hmm, let's start by trying to understand the problem step by step.

First, since f is a polynomial, maybe I can assume a general form for f and then plug it into the equation to solve for the coefficients. Let's start by considering the degree of f. Let me denote the degree of f as n. Then, let's analyze both sides of the equation in terms of degrees.

On the left-hand side (LHS), we have f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2). If f is a polynomial of degree n, then f(x^3) would be a polynomial of degree 3n, because substituting x^3 into a degree n polynomial gives x^(3n). Similarly, f(x^3 - 2) would also be a polynomial of degree 3n, since we're still substituting a cubic term into f. So the LHS is a polynomial of degree 3n minus another polynomial of degree 3n. Therefore, the highest degree term on the LHS would be the difference between the leading terms of f(x^3) and f(x^3 - 2).

On the right-hand side (RHS), we have [f(x)]^2 + 12. The square of a degree n polynomial is a polynomial of degree 2n. Adding 12 (a constant) doesn't change the degree, so the RHS has degree 2n.

Since the equality holds for all x, the degrees of both sides must be equal. Therefore, 3n = 2n, which implies that n = 0. But wait, the problem states that f is a non-constant polynomial, so n must be at least 1. This seems like a contradiction. Did I make a mistake in my reasoning?

Wait, maybe I need to check again. Let's see: If n is the degree of f, then f(x^3) is degree 3n, and f(x^3 - 2) is also 3n. When subtracting them, the leading terms could potentially cancel out if there's a specific relation. For example, if both f(x^3) and f(x^3 - 2) have the same leading term, their difference would have a lower degree. But in that case, the LHS would not be degree 3n. However, the RHS is degree 2n. So unless 3n = 2n, which only happens if n=0, but that's not possible here. Therefore, this suggests that my initial assumption might be wrong, or maybe there's a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the polynomial f is of degree 3? Wait, but even then, 3n = 9 and 2n =6. Hmm, that's not equal. Wait, maybe I need to think differently. Let's suppose that f is a linear polynomial. Let me try n=1.

Suppose f(x) = ax + b. Then, let's compute both sides.

LHS: f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = a(x^3) + b - [a(x^3 - 2) + b] = ax^3 + b - ax^3 + 2a - b = 2a.

RHS: [f(x)]^2 + 12 = (ax + b)^2 + 12 = a^2x^2 + 2abx + b^2 + 12.

But 2a is a constant, while the RHS is a quadratic polynomial. So unless a = 0, which would make f constant, which is not allowed. So linear polynomial doesn't work. So n=1 is impossible.

Next, try n=2 (quadratic polynomial). Let f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c.

Compute LHS: f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = a(x^3)^2 + b(x^3) + c - [a(x^3 - 2)^2 + b(x^3 - 2) + c]

Compute each term:

a(x^3)^2 = a x^6

b(x^3) = b x^3

c = c

a(x^3 - 2)^2 = a(x^6 -4x^3 +4) = a x^6 -4a x^3 +4a

b(x^3 - 2) = b x^3 -2b

c = c

So subtracting:

[a x^6 + b x^3 + c] - [a x^6 -4a x^3 +4a + b x^3 -2b + c]

= a x^6 + b x^3 + c - a x^6 +4a x^3 -4a - b x^3 +2b - c

Simplify:

(a x^6 - a x^6) + (b x^3 - b x^3) + (c - c) +4a x^3 -4a +2b

= 4a x^3 -4a +2b

So LHS is 4a x^3 -4a +2b.

RHS is [f(x)]^2 +12 = (a x^2 +b x +c)^2 +12.

Expanding that:

= a^2 x^4 + 2ab x^3 + (2ac + b^2) x^2 + 2bc x + c^2 +12.

So equate LHS and RHS:

4a x^3 -4a +2b = a^2 x^4 + 2ab x^3 + (2ac + b^2) x^2 + 2bc x + (c^2 +12)

But the LHS has degree 3, while the RHS has degree 4 (if a≠0). Therefore, unless a=0, which would make the RHS degree 2 or lower. But if a=0, then f is linear, which we already saw doesn't work. Therefore, quadratic polynomial is impossible. So n=2 is out.

Next, try n=3 (cubic polynomial). Let f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.

Compute LHS: f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2).

First, f(x^3) = a(x^3)^3 + b(x^3)^2 + c(x^3) + d = a x^9 + b x^6 + c x^3 + d.

f(x^3 - 2) = a(x^3 - 2)^3 + b(x^3 -2)^2 + c(x^3 -2) + d.

Expand each term:

a(x^3 - 2)^3 = a(x^9 -6x^6 +12x^3 -8) = a x^9 -6a x^6 +12a x^3 -8a

b(x^3 -2)^2 = b(x^6 -4x^3 +4) = b x^6 -4b x^3 +4b

c(x^3 -2) = c x^3 -2c

d = d

So f(x^3 -2) = a x^9 -6a x^6 +12a x^3 -8a + b x^6 -4b x^3 +4b + c x^3 -2c + d.

Now subtract f(x^3 -2) from f(x^3):

LHS = [a x^9 + b x^6 + c x^3 + d] - [a x^9 -6a x^6 +12a x^3 -8a + b x^6 -4b x^3 +4b + c x^3 -2c + d]

Compute term by term:

a x^9 - a x^9 = 0

b x^6 - (-6a x^6 + b x^6) = b x^6 +6a x^6 - b x^6 =6a x^6

c x^3 - (12a x^3 -4b x^3 +c x^3) = c x^3 -12a x^3 +4b x^3 -c x^3 = (-12a +4b) x^3

d - (-8a +4b -2c +d) = d +8a -4b +2c -d =8a -4b +2c

So LHS simplifies to 6a x^6 + (-12a +4b) x^3 +8a -4b +2c.

Now, the RHS is [f(x)]^2 +12. Let's compute that.

f(x) = a x^3 +b x^2 +c x +d.

[f(x)]^2 = (a x^3 +b x^2 +c x +d)^2.

Expanding this:

= a^2 x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b^2) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x^3 + (2bd + c^2) x^2 + 2cd x + d^2.

Adding 12 gives:

= a^2 x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b^2) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x^3 + (2bd + c^2) x^2 + 2cd x + (d^2 +12).

Now, set LHS equal to RHS:

6a x^6 + (-12a +4b) x^3 +8a -4b +2c = a^2 x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b^2) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x^3 + (2bd + c^2) x^2 + 2cd x + (d^2 +12).

Now, equate coefficients for corresponding powers of x.

Starting with x^6:

Left: 6a = Right: a^2 ⇒ 6a = a^2 ⇒ a^2 -6a =0 ⇒ a(a -6)=0 ⇒ a=0 or a=6.

But since f is non-constant, a can't be zero. Therefore, a=6.

Next, x^5 term:

Left side has no x^5 term, so coefficient is 0. Right side has 2ab. Therefore, 2ab =0. Since a=6, 2*6*b=0 ⇒ 12b=0 ⇒ b=0.

x^4 term:

Left side has no x^4 term, coefficient 0. Right side has (2ac + b^2). Since b=0, this becomes 2ac. So 2ac=0. But a=6, so 2*6*c=0 ⇒ 12c=0 ⇒ c=0.

x^3 term:

Left side: (-12a +4b) = (-12*6 +4*0) = -72.

Right side: (2ad + 2bc) = 2*6*d + 2*0*c =12d. Therefore, -72 =12d ⇒ d= -6.

x^2 term:

Left side has no x^2 term, coefficient 0. Right side has (2bd + c^2) =2*0*(-6) +0^2=0. So 0=0, which holds.

x term:

Left side has no x term, coefficient 0. Right side has 2cd=2*0*(-6)=0. So 0=0, holds.

Constant term:

Left side:8a -4b +2c =8*6 -4*0 +2*0=48.

Right side: d^2 +12 = (-6)^2 +12=36 +12=48. So 48=48, holds.

So all coefficients match. Therefore, the polynomial is f(x)=6x^3 +0x^2 +0x +(-6)=6x^3 -6.

Let me verify if this works.

Compute LHS: f(x^3) - f(x^3 -2).

f(x^3)=6(x^3)^3 -6=6x^9 -6.

f(x^3 -2)=6(x^3 -2)^3 -6.

Compute (x^3 -2)^3 =x^9 -6x^6 +12x^3 -8. So f(x^3 -2)=6x^9 -6*6x^6 +6*12x^3 -6*8 -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x^3 -48 -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x^3 -54.

Subtracting: f(x^3) - f(x^3 -2) = (6x^9 -6) - (6x^9 -36x^6 +72x^3 -54) =6x^9 -6 -6x^9 +36x^6 -72x^3 +54=36x^6 -72x^3 +48.

Now compute RHS: [f(x)]^2 +12.

f(x)=6x^3 -6. So [f(x)]^2=(6x^3 -6)^2=36x^6 -72x^3 +36. Adding 12 gives 36x^6 -72x^3 +36 +12=36x^6 -72x^3 +48.

Yes, both sides match. So f(x)=6x^3 -6 is indeed a solution.

Therefore, f(5)=6*(5)^3 -6=6*125 -6=750 -6=744.

Wait, but the problem says ""find f(5)"", so the answer is 744. But let me double-check my calculations.

Compute 5^3=125. 6*125=750. 750-6=744. Yes, that's correct.

But wait, the problem statement had a typo in the original question? The user wrote ""Given a non-constant polynomial function \\( f(x) \\) such that \\( f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = f(x) \\cdot f(x) + 12 \\) for all \\( x \\), find \\( f(5) \\).\\frac{2}{3}$"". The last part seems like an error, maybe a formatting mistake. But assuming the rest is correct, the answer is 744.

But let me check if there could be other solutions. Suppose there is another polynomial. But given the way the degrees worked out and all coefficients matched uniquely once we set a=6, b=c=0, d=-6, this seems to be the only solution. Therefore, I think f(5)=744 is correct.

Given a non-constant polynomial function \\( f(x) \\) such that \\( f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\) for all \\( x \\), we need to find \\( f(5) \\).

First, we assume \\( f(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial of the form \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\). We compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the given equation.

1. **Compute \\( f(z) - f(z - 2) \\)**:
   - \\( f(z) = az^3 + bz^2 + cz + d \\)
   - \\( f(z - 2) = a(z - 2)^3 + b(z - 2)^2 + c(z - 2) + d \\)
   - Expanding and simplifying \\( f(z - 2) \\):
     \\[
     f(z - 2) = a(z^3 - 6z^2 + 12z - 8) + b(z^2 - 4z + 4) + c(z - 2) + d
     \\]
     \\[
     = az^3 - 6az^2 + 12az - 8a + bz^2 - 4bz + 4b + cz - 2c + d
     \\]
   - Subtracting \\( f(z - 2) \\) from \\( f(z) \\):
     \\[
     f(z) - f(z - 2) = 6az^2 + (-12a + 4b)z + 8a - 4b + 2c
     \\]

2. **Substitute \\( z = x^3 \\)**:
   - LHS becomes \\( 6ax^6 + (-12a + 4b)x^3 + 8a - 4b + 2c \\).

3. **Expand \\( [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\)**:
   - \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\)
   - \\( [f(x)]^2 = (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)^2 \\)
   - Expanding and simplifying:
     \\[
     [f(x)]^2 + 12 = a^2x^6 + 2abx^5 + (2ac + b^2)x^4 + (2ad + 2bc)x^3 + (2bd + c^2)x^2 + 2cdx + d^2 + 12
     \\]

4. **Equate coefficients**:
   - For \\( x^6 \\): \\( 6a = a^2 \\) gives \\( a = 6 \\).
   - For \\( x^5 \\): \\( 2ab = 0 \\) gives \\( b = 0 \\).
   - For \\( x^4 \\): \\( 2ac + b^2 = 0 \\) gives \\( c = 0 \\).
   - For \\( x^3 \\): \\( -12a + 4b = 2ad + 2bc \\) gives \\( d = -6 \\).
   - Constants: \\( 8a - 4b + 2c = d^2 + 12 \\) confirms \\( d = -6 \\).

Thus, the polynomial is \\( f(x) = 6x^3 - 6 \\).

Finally, we compute \\( f(5) \\):
\\[
f(5) = 6(5)^3 - 6 = 6 \\cdot 125 - 6 = 750 - 6 = 744
\\]

\\[
\\boxed{744}

","Okay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, we have a non-constant polynomial function f(x) such that for all x, f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12. And we need to find f(5). Hmm, okay. That seems a bit tricky, but let's break it down step by step.

First, since f is a polynomial, maybe we can assume it's of a certain degree and figure out what that degree is. Let's think. Suppose f(x) is a polynomial of degree n. Then, let's look at both sides of the equation.

On the left side, f(x³) - f(x³ - 2). Let's see, if f(x) is degree n, then f(x³) would be degree 3n. Similarly, f(x³ - 2) would also be degree 3n because substituting (x³ - 2) into a degree n polynomial still gives a degree 3n polynomial. So the left-hand side (LHS) is a polynomial of degree 3n.

On the right side, [f(x)]² is a polynomial of degree 2n, and then we add 12, which is a constant. So the right-hand side (RHS) is a polynomial of degree 2n.

Now, for these two polynomials to be equal for all x, their degrees must be equal. Therefore, 3n = 2n. Solving that gives n = 0. But wait, the problem says f is a non-constant polynomial. So degree zero would mean it's a constant function, which is not allowed. That's a contradiction. Hmm, so my initial approach must be wrong.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the degrees. Let me check again. If f(x) is degree n, then f(x³) is indeed degree 3n, and f(x³ - 2) is also degree 3n. So their difference would be degree 3n, unless the leading terms cancel out. Similarly, [f(x)]² is degree 2n. So unless 3n = 2n, but that would require n = 0, which is not allowed. Therefore, there must be something wrong with my reasoning.

Wait, maybe f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) doesn't have degree 3n? Let's think. Suppose f(x) is a polynomial of degree n. Let's write f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_0. Then f(x³) = a_n x^{3n} + a_{n-1} x^{3(n-1)} + ... + a_0. Similarly, f(x³ - 2) would be a_n (x³ - 2)^n + ... + a_0. So when we subtract f(x³ - 2) from f(x³), the leading terms would be a_n x^{3n} - a_n (x³ - 2)^n. Let's expand (x³ - 2)^n. The leading term is x^{3n}, and the next term is -n * 2 x^{3n -1}. So the difference f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) would have a leading term of a_n x^{3n} - [a_n (x^{3n} - 2n x^{3n -1} + ... )] = 2n a_n x^{3n -1}. So the leading term of the LHS is 2n a_n x^{3n -1}, which is degree 3n -1. But the RHS is [f(x)]², which is degree 2n. So for the degrees to match, we must have 3n -1 = 2n. Solving that gives n = 1. So n = 1. So f(x) is a linear polynomial. Wait, that's different from before. So maybe the degree is 1? Let me check again.

Wait, if n = 1, then f(x) is linear, so f(x) = ax + b. Then f(x³) = a x³ + b. f(x³ - 2) = a (x³ - 2) + b = a x³ - 2a + b. Therefore, f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = (a x³ + b) - (a x³ - 2a + b) = 2a. So the LHS is a constant, 2a. On the RHS, [f(x)]² + 12 = (ax + b)^2 + 12 = a² x² + 2ab x + (b² + 12). But this is a quadratic polynomial, unless the coefficients of x² and x are zero. So for the equation 2a = a² x² + 2ab x + b² + 12 to hold for all x, the coefficients of x² and x must be zero, and the constant term must equal 2a. So:

1. Coefficient of x²: a² = 0 ⇒ a = 0. But then f(x) is constant, which is not allowed. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, n cannot be 1 either. Hmm, so this approach is not working. Maybe my assumption that f is linear is wrong. But according to the degree analysis, if n=1, but that leads to a contradiction. So maybe there's a mistake in the degree analysis.

Wait, let me go back. When I considered the leading terms of f(x³) - f(x³ - 2), I had f(x³) = a_n x^{3n} + ... and f(x³ - 2) = a_n (x³ - 2)^n + ... Expanding (x³ - 2)^n, the first term is x^{3n}, the second term is -n*2 x^{3n -1}, etc. Therefore, subtracting f(x³ - 2) from f(x³) gives a_n x^{3n} - a_n (x^{3n} - 2n x^{3n -1}) = a_n x^{3n} - a_n x^{3n} + 2n a_n x^{3n -1} = 2n a_n x^{3n -1}. So the leading term of the LHS is 2n a_n x^{3n -1}, which is degree 3n -1. The RHS is [f(x)]², which is degree 2n. Therefore, setting 3n -1 = 2n gives n=1. So n=1, but when we tried that, it didn't work. Therefore, there must be another way.

Wait, maybe f is a quadratic polynomial? Let's test n=2. If f is quadratic, then LHS has degree 3*2 -1=5, and RHS has degree 2*2=4. So 5 vs 4, which is not equal. So that's not possible. Maybe n=3? Then LHS degree is 3*3 -1=8, RHS degree is 6. Not equal. Hmm. So maybe my initial approach is wrong. Alternatively, perhaps f is a constant polynomial, but the problem states it's non-constant. So this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps I made an error in the leading term analysis. Let me check again. Suppose f(x) is a general polynomial. Let f(x) = a_k x^k + ... + a_0. Then f(x³) = a_k x^{3k} + ... + a_0. f(x³ - 2) = a_k (x³ -2)^k + ... + a_0. Expanding (x³ -2)^k, the first term is x^{3k}, the second term is -2k x^{3k -1}, etc. So f(x³) - f(x³ -2) = [a_k x^{3k} + ... + a_0] - [a_k (x^{3k} - 2k x^{3k -1} + ...) + ... + a_0] = a_k x^{3k} - a_k x^{3k} + 2k a_k x^{3k -1} + ... So the leading term is 2k a_k x^{3k -1}. So the degree of LHS is 3k -1. RHS is (f(x))², which is degree 2k. Therefore, equate 3k -1 = 2k ⇒ k=1. So k=1, but when we tried k=1, it didn't work. So maybe this suggests that there is no solution? But the problem states that such a function exists. So perhaps my analysis is missing something.

Alternatively, maybe f is not a polynomial? But the problem says it is a polynomial. Wait, maybe f is a constant function, but the problem says non-constant. Hmm. Wait, perhaps the leading terms cancel out? Let me think. If f(x³) - f(x³ -2) is degree 3k -1, but maybe the coefficients of higher degrees in f(x³) - f(x³ -2) are zero? For example, maybe f(x³) and f(x³ -2) have the same leading terms, so when subtracted, they cancel, and the next term is lower. But according to the previous analysis, the next term is 2k a_k x^{3k -1}. So unless 2k a_k =0, which would require either k=0 (but k is the degree, so k=0 would be constant) or a_k=0. But a_k is the leading coefficient, so it can't be zero. Therefore, the LHS has a term of degree 3k -1, which must equal the degree of RHS, which is 2k. Therefore, 3k -1 = 2k ⇒ k=1. So k=1, but that leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there must be a different approach.

Wait, maybe f is a constant function, but the problem says non-constant. So maybe the equation is satisfied only if the leading terms somehow cancel? Wait, but the problem states that the equation holds for all x. So unless the coefficients of each power of x are equal. So even if the leading terms are different degrees, the equation can't hold unless all coefficients for higher degrees are zero. But according to the previous analysis, if f is non-constant, the LHS has a term of degree 3n -1, and the RHS has degree 2n. So unless 3n -1 = 2n, which gives n=1, but n=1 leads to a contradiction. Therefore, this suggests that maybe the polynomial is of degree 1, but with some specific coefficients? Wait, but when n=1, the LHS is a constant, and the RHS is a quadratic. How can a constant equal a quadratic unless all coefficients of x² and x are zero. So that would require a=0, which is a constant. But the problem says non-constant. So this is a contradiction. Therefore, there must be no solution? But the problem says ""Given a non-constant polynomial function f(x) such that..."", so such a function exists, so my reasoning must be wrong.

Wait, perhaps the polynomial is of degree 0, but non-constant? That's impossible. Wait, maybe the polynomial is not a monic polynomial? Hmm, but even if it's not monic, the leading terms would still be there. Wait, maybe I need to consider that f(x³ - 2) is a shifted version, but when subtracted from f(x³), the leading terms cancel, but the next term is lower. Wait, but according to the previous expansion, the next term is 2k a_k x^{3k -1}, which is degree 3k -1, so unless that term is zero. But that would require 2k a_k =0, which again implies k=0 or a_k=0. But k is the degree, so k≥1, and a_k≠0. Therefore, the term cannot be zero. Therefore, the only possibility is that 3k -1 = 2k, so k=1, but that leads to a contradiction.

This is confusing. Maybe there's a different approach. Let's suppose that f(x) is a constant function. Then f(x³) - f(x³ -2) = c - c = 0. On the other side, [f(x)]² +12 = c² +12. So 0 = c² +12, which implies c² = -12, which is impossible. Therefore, f cannot be constant. So the problem states it's non-constant, so we have to find a non-constant polynomial f(x) satisfying the equation. But according to the previous analysis, this seems impossible. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem? Or perhaps my reasoning is wrong.

Wait, maybe the polynomial is of higher degree, but with some specific coefficients that make the equation hold. Let's suppose f(x) is quadratic. Let me try f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then f(x³) = a x⁶ + b x³ + c. f(x³ - 2) = a (x³ -2)^2 + b (x³ -2) + c = a(x⁶ -4x³ +4) + b x³ -2b + c = a x⁶ -4a x³ +4a + b x³ -2b + c. Therefore, f(x³) - f(x³ -2) = [a x⁶ + b x³ + c] - [a x⁶ -4a x³ +4a + b x³ -2b + c] = (a x⁶ - a x⁶) + (b x³ - (-4a x³ + b x³)) + (c - (4a -2b + c)) = 0 + (b x³ +4a x³ - b x³) + (c -4a +2b -c) = 4a x³ + (-4a +2b). So the LHS is 4a x³ + (-4a +2b). The RHS is [f(x)]² +12 = (ax² +bx +c)^2 +12 = a²x⁴ + 2abx³ + (2ac + b²)x² + 2bcx + (c² +12). So equate coefficients:

For x⁴: a² =0 ⇒ a=0. But then f(x) is linear, which we saw earlier is impossible. Therefore, quadratic also doesn't work.

How about cubic? Let's try f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Then f(x³) = a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d. f(x³ -2) = a (x³ -2)^3 + b (x³ -2)^2 + c (x³ -2) + d. Let's expand this:

(x³ -2)^3 = x⁹ -6x⁶ +12x³ -8

(x³ -2)^2 = x⁶ -4x³ +4

So f(x³ -2) = a(x⁹ -6x⁶ +12x³ -8) + b(x⁶ -4x³ +4) + c(x³ -2) + d = a x⁹ -6a x⁶ +12a x³ -8a + b x⁶ -4b x³ +4b + c x³ -2c + d

Therefore, f(x³) - f(x³ -2) = [a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d] - [a x⁹ -6a x⁶ +12a x³ -8a + b x⁶ -4b x³ +4b + c x³ -2c + d]

Let's compute term by term:

x⁹: a x⁹ - a x⁹ = 0

x⁶: b x⁶ - (-6a x⁶ + b x⁶) = b x⁶ +6a x⁶ -b x⁶ = 6a x⁶

x³: c x³ - (12a x³ -4b x³ +c x³) = c x³ -12a x³ +4b x³ -c x³ = (-12a +4b) x³

Constants: d - (-8a +4b -2c + d) = d +8a -4b +2c -d =8a -4b +2c

So overall, LHS = 6a x⁶ + (-12a +4b) x³ +8a -4b +2c

The RHS is [f(x)]² +12. Let's compute that:

[f(x)]² = (ax³ +bx² +cx +d)^2 = a²x⁶ + 2abx⁵ + (2ac + b²)x⁴ + (2ad + 2bc)x³ + (2bd + c²)x² + 2cdx + d²

Adding 12: a²x⁶ + 2abx⁵ + (2ac + b²)x⁴ + (2ad + 2bc)x³ + (2bd + c²)x² + 2cdx + (d² +12)

Now, equate coefficients of LHS and RHS:

For x⁶: 6a = a² ⇒ a² -6a =0 ⇒ a(a -6)=0 ⇒ a=0 or a=6

For x⁵: LHS has 0, RHS has 2ab. So 2ab =0. If a=6, then 2*6*b=0 ⇒ b=0. If a=0, then from x⁶ term we have 0=0, but then check x⁶ term with a=0: 6*0=0, which is okay, but then let's see.

But since f is non-constant, a=0 would make f quadratic or lower, but we need to check.

But let's first consider a=6. Then from x⁶ term, a=6. Then from x⁵ term, 2ab=0 ⇒ b=0. So b=0.

Now, moving to x⁴ term: LHS has 0, RHS has 2ac + b². Since b=0, this is 2ac. So 2ac=0. Since a=6, this implies 2*6*c=0 ⇒ c=0.

Next, x³ term: LHS has (-12a +4b) x³. With a=6 and b=0, this is (-12*6 +0)= -72 x³. RHS has (2ad + 2bc)x³. With a=6, b=0, c=0, this is 2*6*d + 0=12d. So equate -72 x³ =12d x³ ⇒ -72=12d ⇒ d= -6.

Next, x² term: LHS has 0, RHS has (2bd + c²)x². With b=0, c=0, this is 0. So okay.

x term: LHS has 0, RHS has 2cdx. With c=0, d=-6, this is 2*0*(-6)=0. So okay.

Constant term: LHS is 8a -4b +2c =8*6 -4*0 +2*0=48. RHS is d² +12 = (-6)^2 +12=36+12=48. So constant term matches.

So with a=6, b=0, c=0, d=-6, the equation holds. Therefore, the polynomial is f(x)=6x³ -6. Let's check if this works.

Compute LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ -2). Let's compute f(x³)=6x⁹ -6. f(x³ -2)=6(x³ -2)^3 -6=6(x⁹ -6x⁶ +12x³ -8) -6=6x⁹ -36x⁶ +72x³ -48 -6=6x⁹ -36x⁶ +72x³ -54. Then subtract: (6x⁹ -6) - (6x⁹ -36x⁶ +72x³ -54) =6x⁹ -6 -6x⁹ +36x⁶ -72x³ +54=36x⁶ -72x³ +48.

RHS: [f(x)]² +12=(6x³ -6)^2 +12=36x⁶ -72x³ +36 +12=36x⁶ -72x³ +48. Yes, they match! So this works. Therefore, f(x)=6x³ -6.

Then, the question is to find f(5). So f(5)=6*(5)^3 -6=6*125 -6=750 -6=744. Therefore, the answer is 744.

But wait, the problem statement said ""Return your final answer within \\boxed{}"". So \\boxed{744}

But let me just verify once again to make sure. Let me compute f(x)=6x³ -6. Check LHS and RHS.

Compute LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ -2) =6(x³)^3 -6 - [6((x³ -2)^3) -6] =6x⁹ -6 -6(x⁹ -6x⁶ +12x³ -8) +6=6x⁹ -6 -6x⁹ +36x⁶ -72x³ +48 +6=0 +36x⁶ -72x³ +54 -6=36x⁶ -72x³ +48. Wait, wait, hold on. Wait, expanding f(x³ -2):

f(x³ -2)=6(x³ -2)^3 -6=6(x⁹ -6x⁶ +12x³ -8) -6=6x⁹ -36x⁶ +72x³ -48 -6=6x⁹ -36x⁶ +72x³ -54. Then subtract that from f(x³)=6x⁹ -6:

(6x⁹ -6) - (6x⁹ -36x⁶ +72x³ -54)=6x⁹ -6 -6x⁹ +36x⁶ -72x³ +54=36x⁶ -72x³ +48. Which is the same as the RHS: [f(x)]² +12=(6x³ -6)^2 +12=36x⁶ -72x³ +36 +12=36x⁶ -72x³ +48. So yes, they are equal. Therefore, f(x)=6x³ -6 is indeed a solution. Therefore, f(5)=6*(125) -6=750-6=744. Therefore, the answer is 744.

","Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. So, we have a non-constant polynomial function f(x) such that f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12 for all x. We need to find f(5). Hmm, polynomials... functional equations... okay, let's start by understanding the equation step by step.

First, the left-hand side (LHS) is f(x³) minus f(x³ - 2). The right-hand side (RHS) is [f(x)]² plus 12. Since this holds for all x, maybe we can substitute specific values of x to simplify the equation or find some patterns.

Given that f is a polynomial, let's assume that f(x) is of degree n. Let's try to figure out the possible value of n. Let's analyze the degrees of both sides.

On the LHS, f(x³) would have a degree of 3n (since x³ is degree 3, multiplied by the degree of f). Similarly, f(x³ - 2) would also have degree 3n. Therefore, the LHS, which is f(x³) - f(x³ - 2), would have degree 3n if the leading coefficients don't cancel out. However, when we subtract two polynomials of the same degree, the leading terms would cancel if they are the same. So, unless the leading coefficients are different, the degree would be less. Wait, but f(x³) and f(x³ - 2) have the same argument x³, but shifted? Wait, no. Wait, the arguments are x³ and x³ - 2. So, f(z) - f(z - 2) where z = x³. So, the difference f(z) - f(z - 2). Let's think about that.

If f(z) is a polynomial of degree m, then f(z - 2) is also degree m. The difference f(z) - f(z - 2) would have degree m - 1 if f is linear, but for higher degrees, it might be lower. Wait, actually, if f is of degree m, then f(z) - f(z - 2) is a polynomial of degree m - 1. Because the leading terms (z^m) would cancel out when subtracted. For example, if f(z) = az^m + ..., then f(z - 2) = a(z - 2)^m + ... = a(z^m - 2m z^{m - 1} + ...) + ... So, f(z) - f(z - 2) would have a term of -2m a z^{m - 1} + ... So, the degree is m - 1.

Therefore, the LHS, which is f(z) - f(z - 2) with z = x³, would have degree (m - 1). But m is the degree of f(z), which is the same as the degree of f(x). So, the LHS degree is (m - 1). On the RHS, [f(x)]² has degree 2n, and 12 is a constant. So, the RHS has degree 2n.

Therefore, equating degrees: m - 1 = 2n. But m is the degree of f, which is n. Wait, that can't be. Wait, m is the degree of f in terms of z, but z is x³. Wait, maybe I need to clarify.

Wait, the LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2). Let's let z = x³. Then, the LHS is f(z) - f(z - 2). The degree of f(z) is n, so the degree of f(z) - f(z - 2) is n - 1, as established earlier. The RHS is [f(x)]² + 12, which is degree 2n. Therefore, n - 1 = 2n. Solving that gives n = -1, which doesn't make sense because the degree can't be negative. Hmm, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake in the degree analysis?

Wait, maybe I confused the variables. Let's clarify:

Let’s denote f(x) as a polynomial of degree d. Then:

- f(x³) is a polynomial of degree 3d.
- f(x³ - 2) is also a polynomial of degree 3d.
- Therefore, f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) is a polynomial of degree 3d - 1 (since the leading terms cancel out).

On the other hand, [f(x)]² is a polynomial of degree 2d. Therefore, equating degrees:

3d - 1 = 2d => d = 1.

So, f(x) is a linear polynomial. Wait, that's something. But wait, if d = 1, then f(x) is linear. Let me check that again.

If f is linear, then f(x) = ax + b. Then, let's compute both sides.

Left-hand side: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = a(x³) + b - [a(x³ - 2) + b] = a x³ + b - a x³ + 2a - b = 2a.

Right-hand side: [f(x)]² + 12 = (ax + b)² + 12 = a²x² + 2abx + b² + 12.

But according to the equation, 2a must equal a²x² + 2abx + b² + 12 for all x. However, the left-hand side is a constant (2a), while the right-hand side is a quadratic polynomial. The only way a constant can equal a quadratic polynomial for all x is if all coefficients of the quadratic terms are zero. Therefore:

- a² = 0 => a = 0
- 2ab = 0 => which is already satisfied if a = 0
- b² + 12 + 0 (since 2a is 0) = 0 => b² + 12 = 0

But b² + 12 = 0 implies b² = -12, which is impossible since b is a real number (assuming the polynomial has real coefficients). Therefore, contradiction. Therefore, f(x) cannot be linear. Therefore, our previous conclusion that d = 1 must be wrong.

Wait, that's confusing. Where did we go wrong? Let's check the degree analysis again.

We have f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) which we said has degree 3d - 1. On the other hand, [f(x)]² + 12 has degree 2d. Therefore, 3d - 1 = 2d => d = 1. But that leads to a contradiction. So, perhaps the problem is that the degrees are not matching? Maybe f is not a polynomial? But the problem states it is a polynomial. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the difference f(z) - f(z - 2) is of degree 3d - 1, but the RHS is [f(x)]² + 12, which is degree 2d. So, unless 3d - 1 = 2d, which gives d = 1, but that doesn't work. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming the problem is possible, but the problem states that f is a non-constant polynomial, so there must be a solution. Therefore, maybe my degree analysis is incorrect.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the degree of f(z) - f(z - 2). Let's take a concrete example. Suppose f(z) is a quadratic polynomial: f(z) = az² + bz + c. Then, f(z - 2) = a(z - 2)² + b(z - 2) + c = a(z² - 4z + 4) + b(z - 2) + c = az² - 4az + 4a + bz - 2b + c. Then, f(z) - f(z - 2) = (az² + bz + c) - (az² - 4az + 4a + bz - 2b + c) = az² + bz + c - az² + 4az - 4a - bz + 2b - c = (az² - az²) + (bz - bz) + (c - c) + 4az - 4a + 2b = 4az - 4a + 2b. So, it's a linear polynomial, which is degree 1. So, if f is quadratic, then f(z) - f(z - 2) is linear (degree 1). Similarly, if f is cubic, f(z) - f(z - 2) would be quadratic (degree 2). Therefore, in general, if f is degree m, then f(z) - f(z - 2) is degree m - 1. Therefore, the LHS, which is f(x³) - f(x³ - 2), would be a polynomial of degree (m - 1). But x³ is degree 3, so substituting into f(z) - f(z - 2), which is degree m - 1, gives a polynomial of degree 3*(m - 1). Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, z = x³. So, if f(z) - f(z - 2) is a polynomial in z of degree m - 1, then substituting z = x³, the LHS is (m - 1) in terms of z, which is x³. Therefore, the degree in x would be 3*(m - 1). On the other hand, the RHS is [f(x)]² + 12, which is degree 2m. Therefore, equating degrees: 3*(m - 1) = 2m => 3m - 3 = 2m => m = 3. So, f(x) is a cubic polynomial. That seems better.

Earlier, I thought the degree was 3d - 1, but that was incorrect. The correct analysis is that if f is degree m, then f(z) - f(z - 2) is degree m - 1 in z. Therefore, substituting z = x³, the LHS is degree 3*(m - 1). The RHS is degree 2m. Therefore, 3(m - 1) = 2m => m = 3. So, f(x) is a cubic polynomial.

Okay, so f(x) is cubic. Let's write f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, where a ≠ 0 since it's non-constant.

Now, let's compute both sides of the equation f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12.

First, compute LHS = f(x³) - f(x³ - 2).

Compute f(x³):
a(x³)^3 + b(x³)^2 + c(x³) + d = a x^9 + b x^6 + c x³ + d.

Compute f(x³ - 2):
a(x³ - 2)^3 + b(x³ - 2)^2 + c(x³ - 2) + d.

Let's expand this:

First term: a(x³ - 2)^3 = a(x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x³ - 8).
Second term: b(x³ - 2)^2 = b(x^6 - 4x³ + 4).
Third term: c(x³ - 2) = c x³ - 2c.
Fourth term: d.

So, f(x³ - 2) = a x^9 - 6a x^6 + 12a x³ - 8a + b x^6 - 4b x³ + 4b + c x³ - 2c + d.

Now, subtract f(x³ - 2) from f(x³):

LHS = f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a x^9 + b x^6 + c x³ + d] - [a x^9 - 6a x^6 + 12a x³ - 8a + b x^6 - 4b x³ + 4b + c x³ - 2c + d].

Let's compute term by term:

- a x^9 cancels with -a x^9: 0.
- b x^6 - (-6a x^6) - b x^6 = b x^6 + 6a x^6 - b x^6 = 6a x^6.
- c x³ - 12a x³ - (-4b x³) - c x³ = c x³ - 12a x³ + 4b x³ - c x³ = (-12a + 4b) x³.
- Constants: d - (-8a + 4b - 2c + d) = d + 8a - 4b + 2c - d = 8a - 4b + 2c.

Therefore, LHS simplifies to:

6a x^6 + (-12a + 4b) x³ + 8a - 4b + 2c.

Now, compute RHS = [f(x)]² + 12.

First, compute [f(x)]²:

(ax³ + bx² + cx + d)^2.

Let's expand this:

= a²x^6 + 2abx^5 + (2ac + b²)x^4 + (2ad + 2bc)x³ + (2bd + c²)x² + 2cdx + d².

Then, adding 12 gives:

RHS = a²x^6 + 2abx^5 + (2ac + b²)x^4 + (2ad + 2bc)x³ + (2bd + c²)x² + 2cdx + (d² + 12).

Now, according to the equation, LHS = RHS for all x. Therefore, all corresponding coefficients must be equal.

Let's equate the coefficients for each power of x:

1. x^6: 6a = a² => a² - 6a = 0 => a(a - 6) = 0. Since f is non-constant, a ≠ 0, so a = 6.

2. x^5: 0 = 2ab => 2ab = 0. But since a = 6, this implies 6b = 0 => b = 0.

3. x^4: 0 = 2ac + b². Since b = 0, this becomes 0 = 2ac + 0 => 2ac = 0. Since a = 6 ≠ 0, c = 0.

4. x^3: -12a + 4b = 2ad + 2bc. We know a = 6, b = 0, c = 0. Substitute:

Left side: -12*6 + 4*0 = -72.

Right side: 2*6*d + 2*0*0 = 12d.

Therefore, -72 = 12d => d = -6.

5. x^2: 0 = 2bd + c². Since b = 0 and c = 0, this is 0 = 0 + 0, which holds.

6. x: 0 = 2cd. Since c = 0 and d = -6, this is 0 = 0, which holds.

7. Constant term: 8a - 4b + 2c = d² + 12. Substitute known values:

Left side: 8*6 - 4*0 + 2*0 = 48.

Right side: (-6)^2 + 12 = 36 + 12 = 48.

So, 48 = 48, which holds.

Therefore, all coefficients match with a = 6, b = 0, c = 0, d = -6. Therefore, the polynomial is f(x) = 6x³ - 6.

Let's verify this solution.

Compute LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2).

f(x³) = 6(x³)^3 - 6 = 6x^9 - 6.

f(x³ - 2) = 6(x³ - 2)^3 - 6 = 6(x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x³ - 8) - 6 = 6x^9 - 36x^6 + 72x³ - 48 - 6 = 6x^9 - 36x^6 + 72x³ - 54.

Subtracting: (6x^9 - 6) - (6x^9 - 36x^6 + 72x³ - 54) = 6x^9 - 6 -6x^9 +36x^6 -72x³ +54 = 36x^6 -72x³ +48.

Compute RHS: [f(x)]² + 12.

f(x) = 6x³ - 6.

[f(x)]² = (6x³ - 6)^2 = 36x^6 - 72x³ + 36.

Add 12: 36x^6 - 72x³ + 36 + 12 = 36x^6 - 72x³ + 48.

Which matches the LHS. Therefore, the solution is correct.

Therefore, f(x) = 6x³ - 6. Now, we need to find f(5).

Compute f(5) = 6*(5)^3 - 6 = 6*125 - 6 = 750 - 6 = 744.

Therefore, the answer is 744. Let me just check once more to ensure there's no calculation error.

5 cubed is 125. 6*125 is 750. Subtract 6: 750 - 6 = 744. Yes, that's correct. And all steps in the verification matched up, so the solution seems solid.

","Okay, let's try to solve this problem. So, we have a non-constant polynomial function f(x) that satisfies the equation f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12 for all x. We need to find f(5). Hmm, right. 

First, since f is a polynomial, maybe I can assume its degree and try to find the coefficients. Let's denote the degree of f(x) as n. Then, f(x³) would be a polynomial of degree 3n, and f(x³ - 2) would also be a polynomial of degree 3n. Subtracting them, f(x³) - f(x³ - 2), should result in a polynomial of degree 3n. On the right-hand side, [f(x)]² is a polynomial of degree 2n, so 2n must equal 3n. Wait, that would imply 2n = 3n, so n = 0. But the problem states that f is non-constant, so n can't be zero. That's a contradiction. 

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. The left-hand side is f(x³) - f(x³ - 2). If f is a polynomial of degree n, then f(x³) is degree 3n, and f(x³ - 2) is also degree 3n. But when we subtract two polynomials of the same degree, the leading terms might cancel out? Hmm. So maybe the highest degree term cancels, leading to a lower degree. Therefore, the left-hand side's degree could be less than 3n. 

On the other hand, the right-hand side is [f(x)]², which is degree 2n. Therefore, equating the degrees: left-hand side degree ≤ 3n, right-hand side degree is 2n. So, unless 3n = 2n, which would mean n=0, which is not allowed. Wait, but maybe the leading terms cancel on the left-hand side, so the next highest term becomes the new leading term. Let me think. 

Suppose f(x) is a linear polynomial. Let's test that. Let f(x) = ax + b. Then f(x³) = a x³ + b, and f(x³ - 2) = a(x³ - 2) + b = a x³ - 2a + b. Then f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = (a x³ + b) - (a x³ - 2a + b) = 2a. On the right-hand side, [f(x)]² +12 = (ax + b)² +12 = a²x² + 2abx + b² +12. But the left-hand side is a constant (2a) and the right-hand side is a quadratic. These can't be equal unless a=0, which would make f constant, but f is non-constant. So linear doesn't work.

Next, let's try quadratic. Let f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then f(x³) = a x⁶ + b x³ + c, and f(x³ - 2) = a(x³ - 2)² + b(x³ - 2) + c = a(x⁶ -4x³ +4) + b x³ - 2b + c = a x⁶ -4a x³ +4a + b x³ -2b + c. Then f(x³) - f(x³ -2) = [a x⁶ + b x³ + c] - [a x⁶ -4a x³ +4a + b x³ -2b + c] = (a x⁶ - a x⁶) + (b x³ +4a x³ - b x³) + (c -4a +2b -c) = 4a x³ + (-4a + 2b). 

On the other hand, the right-hand side is [f(x)]² +12 = (a x² + b x + c)² +12. Expanding that gives a²x⁴ + 2abx³ + (2ac + b²)x² + 2bcx + c² +12. Comparing the left-hand side (which is 4a x³ + (-4a + 2b)) and the right-hand side (which is quadratic in x², etc.), we have different degrees. Left-hand side is cubic, right-hand side is quartic. So unless all coefficients of higher degrees on the right-hand side are zero, which would require a² =0, leading to a=0, but then f(x) would be linear, which we already saw doesn't work. So quadratic is out.

How about cubic? Let's try f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Then f(x³) = a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d. f(x³ - 2) = a(x³ -2)³ + b(x³ -2)² + c(x³ -2) + d. Let's compute that:

First, (x³ -2)³ = x⁹ -6x⁶ +12x³ -8

(x³ -2)² = x⁶ -4x³ +4

So f(x³ -2) = a(x⁹ -6x⁶ +12x³ -8) + b(x⁶ -4x³ +4) + c(x³ -2) + d

= a x⁹ -6a x⁶ +12a x³ -8a + b x⁶ -4b x³ +4b + c x³ -2c + d

Combine like terms:

x⁹ term: a x⁹

x⁶ terms: (-6a + b) x⁶

x³ terms: (12a -4b + c) x³

Constants: -8a +4b -2c + d

Therefore, f(x³) - f(x³ -2) = [a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d] - [a x⁹ + (-6a + b) x⁶ + (12a -4b + c) x³ + (-8a +4b -2c + d)]

Compute term by term:

x⁹: a x⁹ - a x⁹ = 0

x⁶: b x⁶ - (-6a + b) x⁶ = (b +6a -b) x⁶ = 6a x⁶

x³: c x³ - (12a -4b + c) x³ = (c -12a +4b -c) x³ = (-12a +4b) x³

Constants: d - (-8a +4b -2c + d) = d +8a -4b +2c -d = 8a -4b +2c

So overall, f(x³) - f(x³ -2) = 6a x⁶ + (-12a +4b) x³ +8a -4b +2c

On the right-hand side, [f(x)]² +12 = (a x³ + b x² + c x + d)² +12. Let's expand that:

= a²x⁶ + 2abx⁵ + (2ac + b²)x⁴ + (2ad + 2bc)x³ + (2bd + c²)x² + 2cdx + d² +12

Now, equate the left-hand side (6a x⁶ + (-12a +4b) x³ +8a -4b +2c) to the right-hand side (which includes terms up to x⁶ and lower). For these two polynomials to be equal for all x, their corresponding coefficients must be equal. Let's set up equations by comparing coefficients:

For x⁶ term: 6a = a² ⇒ a² -6a =0 ⇒ a(a -6)=0. Since f is non-constant, a ≠0, so a=6.

For x⁵ term: On the left-hand side, there is no x⁵ term, so coefficient is 0. On the right-hand side, coefficient is 2ab. Therefore, 2ab =0. Since a=6≠0, this implies b=0.

For x⁴ term: Similarly, left-hand side has 0 coefficient, right-hand side has 2ac + b². Since b=0, this becomes 2ac. So 2ac=0. a=6≠0, so c=0.

For x³ term: Left-hand side coefficient is (-12a +4b). Right-hand side coefficient is 2ad +2bc. Since a=6, b=0, c=0, this becomes 2*6*d +2*0*0=12d. So equation: -12*6 +4*0 =12d ⇒ -72 =12d ⇒ d= -6.

For x² term: Left-hand side has 0 coefficient. Right-hand side has 2bd +c². Since b=0, c=0, this is 0. So that's okay.

For x term: Left-hand side has 0 coefficient. Right-hand side has 2cd. Since c=0, this is 0. Okay.

Constant term: Left-hand side is 8a -4b +2c. With a=6, b=0, c=0: 8*6 -4*0 +2*0 =48. Right-hand side is d² +12. d=-6, so (-6)^2 +12=36 +12=48. Which matches. 

So all coefficients match. Therefore, the polynomial is f(x)=6x³ +0x² +0x +(-6)=6x³ -6.

Let me verify this function. Let's check if f(5) is 6*(125) -6=750 -6=744. But before that, let me confirm that f(x)=6x³ -6 actually satisfies the original equation.

Compute f(x³) -f(x³ -2):

f(x³)=6(x³)^3 -6=6x^9 -6

f(x³ -2)=6(x³ -2)^3 -6. Let's expand (x³ -2)^3:

x^9 -6x^6 +12x³ -8. So f(x³ -2)=6(x^9 -6x^6 +12x³ -8) -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -48 -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54

Subtracting: f(x³) -f(x³ -2)= (6x^9 -6) - (6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54)=6x^9 -6 -6x^9 +36x^6 -72x³ +54=36x^6 -72x³ +48.

On the other hand, [f(x)]² +12= (6x³ -6)^2 +12=36x^6 -72x³ +36 +12=36x^6 -72x³ +48. Which matches! So yes, f(x)=6x³ -6 satisfies the equation. Therefore, f(5)=6*(125) -6=750 -6=744.

Wait, but the problem statement at the end says ""find f(5).\\frac{2}{3}"". Maybe there's a typo. But according to my solution, it's 744. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 6*5³ -6. 5³ is 125, 6*125 is 750, minus 6 is 744. Yes, that's correct. So the answer should be 744. But the problem might have a typo, but perhaps I made a mistake in the polynomial. Let me check the steps again.

Wait, when we solved for a, we found a=6. Then b=0, c=0, d=-6. So f(x)=6x³ -6. Plugging in x=5 gives 6*125 -6=750-6=744. That seems right. 

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting a different approach? Let me think. For example, suppose we set y =x³, then the equation becomes f(y) - f(y -2) = [f(x)]² +12. But then y is x³, so x = y^(1/3). Therefore, [f(x)]² = [f(y^(1/3))]^2. Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe take x=0. Let's try x=0. Then the equation becomes f(0) - f(-2) = [f(0)]² +12. Let's compute that with f(x)=6x³ -6. f(0)= -6, f(-2)=6*(-8)-6= -48 -6= -54. So left-hand side: -6 - (-54)=48. Right-hand side: (-6)^2 +12=36 +12=48. Correct. So that works. 

Another check: x=1. Then f(1) -f(1 -2)=f(1)-f(-1). f(1)=6*1 -6=0, f(-1)=6*(-1)^3 -6= -6 -6= -12. So left-hand side: 0 - (-12)=12. Right-hand side: [f(1)]² +12=0 +12=12. Correct. 

x=2. f(8) -f(8 -2)=f(8) -f(6). f(8)=6*512 -6=3072 -6=3066. f(6)=6*216 -6=1296 -6=1290. So 3066 -1290=1776. Right-hand side: [f(2)]² +12. f(2)=6*8 -6=48 -6=42. 42² +12=1764 +12=1776. Correct. So the function works. Therefore, f(5)=744. 

But the problem has a strange part at the end: ""find f(5).\\frac{2}{3}"". Maybe that's a typo, perhaps f(5) is 744, and the \\frac{2}{3} is part of another question? Or maybe the original problem had a different polynomial? Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the degree? Let me check the degree again. 

Wait, when f is a cubic, then f(x³) is degree 9, f(x³ -2) is also degree 9, so their difference is degree 9. But the right-hand side [f(x)]² is degree 6. Wait, hold on! Wait, f(x) is cubic, so [f(x)]² is degree 6. But the left-hand side is f(x³) -f(x³ -2), which we found to be 6x⁶ + ... So the left-hand side is degree 6, and the right-hand side is also degree 6. Wait, but earlier when I thought about the degrees, I had a conflict, but actually, the leading terms can cancel. For example, in the cubic case, f(x³) and f(x³ -2) both have x^9 terms, which cancel when subtracted, leaving the next highest term, which is x^6. So in that case, the left-hand side is degree 6, and the right-hand side is degree 6. Therefore, the degrees match. So that's okay. 

Therefore, the answer is 744. So I think the final answer is 744. The \\frac{2}{3} at the end might be a mistake or part of a different problem. Anyway, based on the steps, f(5)=744.

Given a non-constant polynomial function \\( f(x) \\) such that \\( f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\) for all \\( x \\), we need to find \\( f(5) \\).

First, we assume \\( f(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial of the form \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\). We compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the given equation.

1. **Compute \\( f(z) - f(z - 2) \\)**:
   - \\( f(z) = az^3 + bz^2 + cz + d \\)
   - \\( f(z - 2) = a(z - 2)^3 + b(z - 2)^2 + c(z - 2) + d \\)
   - Expanding and simplifying \\( f(z - 2) \\):
     \\[
     f(z - 2) = a(z^3 - 6z^2 + 12z - 8) + b(z^2 - 4z + 4) + c(z - 2) + d
     \\]
     \\[
     = az^3 - 6az^2 + 12az - 8a + bz^2 - 4bz + 4b + cz - 2c + d
     \\]
   - Subtracting \\( f(z - 2) \\) from \\( f(z) \\):
     \\[
     f(z) - f(z - 2) = 6az^2 + (-12a + 4b)z + 8a - 4b + 2c
     \\]

2. **Substitute \\( z = x^3 \\)**:
   - LHS becomes \\( 6ax^6 + (-12a + 4b)x^3 + 8a - 4b + 2c \\).

3. **Expand \\( [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\)**:
   - \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\)
   - \\( [f(x)]^2 = (ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d)^2 \\)
   - Expanding and simplifying:
     \\[
     [f(x)]^2 + 12 = a^2x^6 + 2abx^5 + (2ac + b^2)x^4 + (2ad + 2bc)x^3 + (2bd + c^2)x^2 + 2cdx + d^2 + 12
     \\]

4. **Equate coefficients**:
   - For \\( x^6 \\): \\( 6a = a^2 \\) gives \\( a = 6 \\).
   - For \\( x^5 \\): \\( 2ab = 0 \\) gives \\( b = 0 \\).
   - For \\( x^4 \\): \\( 2ac + b^2 = 0 \\) gives \\( c = 0 \\).
   - For \\( x^3 \\): \\( -12a + 4b = 2ad + 2bc \\) gives \\( d = -6 \\).
   - Constants: \\( 8a - 4b + 2c = d^2 + 12 \\) confirms \\( d = -6 \\).

Thus, the polynomial is \\( f(x) = 6x^3 - 6 \\).

Finally, we compute \\( f(5) \\):
\\[
f(5) = 6(5)^3 - 6 = 6 \\cdot 125 - 6 = 750 - 6 = 744
\\]

\\[
\\boxed{744}

","Okay, so I have this problem here: Find f(5) where f is a non-constant polynomial function such that for all x, f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12. Hmm, let's see. Alright, so first, I need to figure out what polynomial f could satisfy this equation. Since it's a polynomial, maybe I can assume a general form and then determine the coefficients. Let me start by considering the degree of f.

Let's suppose that f is a polynomial of degree n. Then, f(x³) would be a polynomial of degree 3n, and f(x³ - 2) would also be of degree 3n. On the right-hand side, [f(x)]² is a polynomial of degree 2n. So, for the equation to hold for all x, the degrees on both sides must be equal. Therefore, 3n = 2n. Wait, that would mean n = 0. But the problem states that f is non-constant, so n must be at least 1. This seems contradictory. Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, hold on. Let me check again. The left side is f(x³) - f(x³ - 2). Both f(x³) and f(x³ - 2) are degree 3n. So subtracting them would result in a polynomial of degree 3n, unless the leading terms cancel out. Similarly, the right side is [f(x)]², which is degree 2n. So, for these two sides to have the same degree, we must have 3n = 2n, which implies n = 0. But since f is non-constant, n cannot be zero. Therefore, the only way this is possible is if the leading terms on the left side cancel out, and the remaining terms match the degree 2n on the right side. Hmm, maybe that's possible if 3n = 2n + something? Wait, perhaps if the leading terms actually cancel each other, then the next highest degree term would be of lower degree. Let me think. For example, if f is a quadratic polynomial, then 3n would be 6, and 2n would be 4. But 6 ≠ 4. If f is linear, 3n = 3, 2n = 2. Still not equal. If f is cubic, 3n = 9, 2n = 6. Still different. Wait, so maybe there's a mistake in my initial approach.

Alternatively, perhaps the leading terms do cancel out. Let's suppose f is a quadratic polynomial. Then f(x³) is degree 6, f(x³ - 2) is also degree 6, so subtracting them would give a polynomial of degree at most 6. The right-hand side is [f(x)]², which is degree 4. But 6 ≠ 4, so that can't be. Similarly, if f is cubic, left side is degree 9, right side is 6. Still not equal. If f is quadratic, same issue. If f is linear, left side is degree 3, right side is 2. So, this seems impossible unless the leading terms cancel. Wait, but even if the leading terms cancel, the next term would have a lower degree. For example, suppose f is quadratic: f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) would be [a(x³)² + b(x³) + c] - [a(x³ - 2)² + b(x³ - 2) + c]. Expanding that:

= [a x⁶ + b x³ + c] - [a(x⁶ - 4x³ + 4) + b x³ - 2b + c]

= a x⁶ + b x³ + c - a x⁶ + 4a x³ - 4a - b x³ + 2b - c

Simplify:

= (a x⁶ - a x⁶) + (b x³ - b x³ + 4a x³) + (c - c) + (-4a + 2b)

= 4a x³ + (-4a + 2b)

So the left-hand side becomes 4a x³ + (-4a + 2b). The right-hand side is [f(x)]² + 12 = (ax² + bx + c)² + 12. Expanding that:

= a² x⁴ + 2ab x³ + (2ac + b²) x² + 2bc x + c² + 12

So, equating the left-hand side (degree 3) to the right-hand side (degree 4) would require that the coefficients of x⁴, x³, x², x, and the constant term match. However, on the left side, there's no x⁴ term, x³ term (except 4a x³), and lower terms. On the right side, there is an x⁴ term, x³ term, etc. So unless a² = 0, which would imply a = 0, but then f would be linear, but then we saw that linear functions don't work. Similarly, if a ≠ 0, then the x⁴ term on the right must be zero, which is impossible unless a = 0. Therefore, quadratic polynomials don't work.

Similarly, if f is linear, say f(x) = ax + b. Then f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a x³ + b] - [a(x³ - 2) + b] = a x³ + b - a x³ + 2a - b = 2a. The right-hand side is [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x + b)² + 12 = a² x² + 2ab x + (b² + 12). Setting 2a = a² x² + 2ab x + (b² + 12) for all x. But the left side is a constant, and the right side is a quadratic polynomial. Therefore, coefficients of x² and x must be zero, and the constant term must equal 2a. So:

a² = 0 => a = 0

But then f is non-constant, so a ≠ 0. Contradiction. Therefore, linear functions don't work either.

Hmm, so maybe f is a cubic polynomial? Let's try that. Let f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Then f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) would be:

a(x³)³ + b(x³)² + c(x³) + d - [a(x³ - 2)³ + b(x³ - 2)² + c(x³ - 2) + d]

Let's compute each term:

First, expand (x³ - 2)³ = x⁹ - 6x⁶ + 12x³ - 8

Similarly, (x³ - 2)² = x⁶ - 4x³ + 4

So substituting:

f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d] - [a(x⁹ - 6x⁶ + 12x³ - 8) + b(x⁶ - 4x³ + 4) + c(x³ - 2) + d]

Expanding the second part:

= a x⁹ - 6a x⁶ + 12a x³ - 8a + b x⁶ - 4b x³ + 4b + c x³ - 2c + d

Now subtract this from the first part:

= [a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d] - [a x⁹ - 6a x⁶ + 12a x³ - 8a + b x⁶ - 4b x³ + 4b + c x³ - 2c + d]

= a x⁹ + b x⁶ + c x³ + d - a x⁹ + 6a x⁶ - 12a x³ + 8a - b x⁶ + 4b x³ - 4b - c x³ + 2c - d

Simplify term by term:

a x⁹ - a x⁹ = 0

b x⁶ - (-6a x⁶) - b x⁶ = (b + 6a - b) x⁶ = 6a x⁶

c x³ - 12a x³ + 4b x³ - c x³ = (c - 12a + 4b - c) x³ = (-12a + 4b) x³

d - (-8a) - 4b - (-2c) - d = d + 8a - 4b + 2c - d = 8a - 4b + 2c

So overall, f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) simplifies to:

6a x⁶ + (-12a + 4b) x³ + (8a - 4b + 2c)

On the right-hand side, [f(x)]² + 12 = (ax³ + bx² + cx + d)² + 12

Expanding that:

= a² x⁶ + 2ab x⁵ + (2ac + b²) x⁴ + (2ad + 2bc) x³ + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + (d² + 12)

Now, equate the left-hand side (which is 6a x⁶ + (-12a + 4b) x³ + (8a - 4b + 2c)) to the right-hand side. For these two polynomials to be equal for all x, their corresponding coefficients must be equal.

So let's set up equations by equating coefficients:

For x⁶: 6a = a²

For x⁵: 0 = 2ab

For x⁴: 0 = 2ac + b²

For x³: -12a + 4b = 2ad + 2bc

For x²: 0 = 2bd + c²

For x: 0 = 2cd

For constants: 8a - 4b + 2c = d² + 12

So let's solve these equations step by step.

Starting with the x⁶ term:

6a = a² ⇒ a² - 6a = 0 ⇒ a(a - 6) = 0 ⇒ a = 0 or a = 6

But since f is non-constant, a ≠ 0. Therefore, a = 6.

Next, the x⁵ term: 0 = 2ab. Since a = 6 ≠ 0, then b = 0.

Moving to the x⁴ term: 0 = 2ac + b². Since a = 6 and b = 0:

0 = 2*6*c + 0 ⇒ 12c = 0 ⇒ c = 0

Next, the x term: 0 = 2cd. Since c = 0, this equation is satisfied regardless of d.

Now, moving to the x³ term: -12a + 4b = 2ad + 2bc

Substituting a = 6, b = 0, c = 0:

Left side: -12*6 + 4*0 = -72

Right side: 2*6*d + 2*0*0 = 12d

Therefore, -72 = 12d ⇒ d = -6

Next, the x² term: 0 = 2bd + c². Substituting b = 0, d = -6, c = 0:

0 = 2*0*(-6) + 0² ⇒ 0 = 0 + 0 ⇒ 0 = 0. So this holds.

Finally, the constant term: 8a - 4b + 2c = d² + 12

Substituting a = 6, b = 0, c = 0, d = -6:

Left side: 8*6 - 4*0 + 2*0 = 48

Right side: (-6)² + 12 = 36 + 12 = 48

Perfect, this checks out.

So, the coefficients are a = 6, b = 0, c = 0, d = -6. Therefore, the polynomial is:

f(x) = 6x³ - 6

Let me verify if this polynomial satisfies the original equation.

Compute f(x³) - f(x³ - 2):

f(x³) = 6(x³)³ - 6 = 6x⁹ - 6

f(x³ - 2) = 6(x³ - 2)³ - 6

First, expand (x³ - 2)³ = x⁹ - 6x⁶ + 12x³ - 8

Therefore, f(x³ - 2) = 6(x⁹ - 6x⁶ + 12x³ - 8) - 6 = 6x⁹ - 36x⁶ + 72x³ - 48 - 6 = 6x⁹ - 36x⁶ + 72x³ - 54

Subtracting f(x³ - 2) from f(x³):

(6x⁹ - 6) - (6x⁹ - 36x⁶ + 72x³ - 54) = 6x⁹ - 6 - 6x⁹ + 36x⁶ - 72x³ + 54 = 36x⁶ - 72x³ + 48

Now, compute [f(x)]² + 12:

f(x) = 6x³ - 6

[f(x)]² = (6x³ - 6)² = 36x⁶ - 72x³ + 36

Adding 12: 36x⁶ - 72x³ + 36 + 12 = 36x⁶ - 72x³ + 48

Which matches the left-hand side. So yes, the polynomial f(x) = 6x³ - 6 satisfies the equation.

Therefore, the value of f(5) is f(5) = 6*(5)³ - 6 = 6*125 - 6 = 750 - 6 = 744.

","Okay, so I need to find f(5) where f is a non-constant polynomial that satisfies the equation f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12 for all x. Hmm, let's start by understanding what this equation is saying. It relates the values of the polynomial at different points, specifically x³ and x³ - 2, and connects them to the square of the polynomial evaluated at x plus 12. 

First, since f is a polynomial, maybe I can assume a general form for f(x) and try to find its coefficients. Let me think. If f is non-constant, the simplest case might be a linear polynomial. Let's try that. Suppose f(x) = ax + b, where a ≠ 0. Then let's compute both sides of the equation.

Left-hand side (LHS): f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a(x³) + b] - [a(x³ - 2) + b] = a x³ + b - a x³ + 2a - b = 2a.

Right-hand side (RHS): [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x + b)² + 12 = a² x² + 2ab x + b² + 12.

So, setting LHS = RHS: 2a = a² x² + 2ab x + b² + 12. But this equation must hold for all x, which is impossible unless the coefficients of x² and x on the RHS are zero. That would require a² = 0 and 2ab = 0. Since a ≠ 0 (as f is non-constant), a² = 0 would imply a = 0, which contradicts a being non-zero. So, linear polynomials don't work. That's a dead end.

Okay, maybe f is quadratic. Let's assume f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then compute LHS and RHS.

LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a(x³)² + b(x³) + c] - [a(x³ - 2)² + b(x³ - 2) + c].

Let me compute each term:

First, f(x³) = a x⁶ + b x³ + c.

f(x³ - 2) = a(x³ - 2)² + b(x³ - 2) + c.

Expanding f(x³ - 2):

= a(x⁶ - 4x³ + 4) + b(x³ - 2) + c

= a x⁶ - 4a x³ + 4a + b x³ - 2b + c

= a x⁶ + (-4a + b) x³ + (4a - 2b + c)

Therefore, LHS = f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a x⁶ + b x³ + c] - [a x⁶ + (-4a + b) x³ + (4a - 2b + c)]

= (a x⁶ - a x⁶) + [b x³ - (-4a + b) x³] + [c - (4a - 2b + c)]

= 0 + [b + 4a - b] x³ + [c - 4a + 2b - c]

= 4a x³ + (-4a + 2b)

So, LHS is 4a x³ + (-4a + 2b).

Now, RHS is [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x² + b x + c)² + 12.

Expanding that:

= a² x⁴ + 2ab x³ + (2ac + b²) x² + 2bc x + c² + 12.

So, equating LHS and RHS:

4a x³ + (-4a + 2b) = a² x⁴ + 2ab x³ + (2ac + b²) x² + 2bc x + c² + 12.

Again, for this equation to hold for all x, the coefficients of corresponding powers of x must be equal. Let's set them equal:

For x⁴: 0 = a² ⇒ a = 0. But f is non-constant, so a ≠ 0. Contradiction. Therefore, quadratic polynomials don't work either.

Hmm, maybe cubic? Let's try f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d. Then compute LHS and RHS.

First, LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2).

Compute f(x³) = a(x³)^3 + b(x³)^2 + c(x³) + d = a x^9 + b x^6 + c x³ + d.

Compute f(x³ - 2) = a(x³ - 2)^3 + b(x³ - 2)^2 + c(x³ - 2) + d.

Let's expand each term:

First term: a(x³ - 2)^3 = a(x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x³ - 8).

Second term: b(x³ - 2)^2 = b(x^6 - 4x³ + 4).

Third term: c(x³ - 2) = c x³ - 2c.

Fourth term: d.

So, f(x³ - 2) = a x^9 - 6a x^6 + 12a x³ - 8a + b x^6 - 4b x³ + 4b + c x³ - 2c + d.

Combine like terms:

= a x^9 + (-6a + b) x^6 + (12a - 4b + c) x³ + (-8a + 4b - 2c + d).

Therefore, LHS = f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a x^9 + b x^6 + c x³ + d] - [a x^9 + (-6a + b) x^6 + (12a - 4b + c) x³ + (-8a + 4b - 2c + d)].

Compute each term:

x^9: a x^9 - a x^9 = 0.

x^6: b x^6 - (-6a + b) x^6 = [b + 6a - b] x^6 = 6a x^6.

x³: c x³ - (12a - 4b + c) x³ = [c - 12a + 4b - c] x³ = (-12a + 4b) x³.

Constants: d - (-8a + 4b - 2c + d) = d + 8a - 4b + 2c - d = 8a - 4b + 2c.

So, LHS = 6a x^6 + (-12a + 4b) x³ + (8a - 4b + 2c).

Now, RHS is [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x³ + b x² + c x + d)^2 + 12.

Expanding [f(x)]²:

= a² x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b²) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x³ + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + d² + 12.

Comparing LHS and RHS:

LHS: 6a x^6 + (-12a + 4b) x³ + (8a - 4b + 2c).

RHS: a² x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b²) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x³ + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + d² + 12.

Again, equating coefficients for each power of x:

x^6: 6a = a² ⇒ a² - 6a = 0 ⇒ a(a - 6) = 0. Since a ≠ 0 (non-constant), a = 6.

x^5: 0 = 2ab ⇒ 2ab = 0. Since a = 6, 2*6*b = 0 ⇒ b = 0.

x^4: 0 = 2ac + b². Since b = 0, this becomes 0 = 2*6*c + 0 ⇒ 12c = 0 ⇒ c = 0.

x^3: -12a + 4b = 2ad + 2bc. Substitute a=6, b=0, c=0:

Left side: -12*6 + 4*0 = -72.

Right side: 2*6*d + 2*0*0 = 12d.

Thus, -72 = 12d ⇒ d = -6.

x²: 0 = 2bd + c². Since b=0 and c=0, this is 0 = 0 + 0, which holds.

x: 0 = 2cd. Since c=0, this is 0 = 0, holds.

Constants: 8a -4b + 2c = d² + 12.

Substitute a=6, b=0, c=0, d=-6:

Left side: 8*6 -4*0 + 2*0 = 48.

Right side: (-6)^2 + 12 = 36 + 12 = 48.

Yes, that works. So, all conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the polynomial is f(x) = 6x³ + 0x² + 0x + (-6) = 6x³ - 6.

Wait, but let's check if this satisfies the original equation.

Let me verify f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12.

Compute f(x³) = 6(x³)^3 -6 = 6x^9 -6.

f(x³ -2) = 6(x³ -2)^3 -6. Let's expand that:

= 6(x^9 -6x^6 +12x³ -8) -6 = 6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -48 -6 = 6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54.

Then, f(x³) - f(x³ -2) = (6x^9 -6) - (6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54) = 6x^9 -6 -6x^9 +36x^6 -72x³ +54 = 36x^6 -72x³ +48.

Now, [f(x)]² +12 = (6x³ -6)^2 +12 = 36x^6 -72x³ +36 +12 = 36x^6 -72x³ +48. Which matches. So yes, it works.

Therefore, the polynomial is f(x) = 6x³ -6. Therefore, f(5) = 6*(5)^3 -6 = 6*125 -6 = 750 -6 = 744.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me check again. The problem states that f is a non-constant polynomial, and we found a cubic polynomial that works. The steps seem okay: tried linear, quadratic, cubic. Cubic worked. So f(5) is 744. Hmm.

But let me think again if there could be other possibilities. Suppose the polynomial is of higher degree. Wait, in our check, when we assumed cubic, the equation gave us a consistent solution, so even though higher degree polynomials could be considered, in this case, the equation forced the coefficients of higher degrees to zero. For example, in the cubic case, the x^6 term in LHS had to equal the x^6 term in RHS, which gave a=6. Then higher degrees (like x^9) had to cancel out, but in our case, the x^9 terms canceled out. So maybe the cubic is the only solution. Let's check with another approach.

Alternatively, suppose we let z = x³. Then the original equation becomes f(z) - f(z - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12. But z = x³, so x = z^{1/3}. Therefore, [f(x)]² = [f(z^{1/3})]^2. So the equation becomes f(z) - f(z -2) = [f(z^{1/3})]^2 + 12 for all z. Hmm, not sure if that helps, but maybe considering the functional equation. 

But since we already have a solution, maybe it's the only one. Let's see. Suppose f is a cubic polynomial. Then the equation relates f(z) - f(z -2) to [f(z^{1/3})]^2 +12. But in our previous steps, substituting z = x³, we found that f(z) - f(z -2) is a cubic polynomial in z (since f(z) is cubic, so f(z) - f(z -2) would be cubic in z), but on the RHS, [f(z^{1/3})]^2 would be a degree 2*3 = 6 polynomial in x, but z = x³, so z^{1/3} = x, so [f(z^{1/3})]^2 is [f(x)]², which is degree 6 in x, but in terms of z, since z = x³, x = z^{1/3}, so [f(z^{1/3})]^2 is [6 z^{1/3} -6]^2 = 36 z^{2/3} -72 z^{1/3} +36. But z^{2/3} is x², z^{1/3} is x, so when expressed in terms of x, it's 36x² -72x +36, but in terms of z, it's 36 z^{2/3} -72 z^{1/3} +36. However, the left-hand side f(z) - f(z -2) is a cubic polynomial in z, but the right-hand side is not a polynomial in z unless 2/3 and 1/3 are integers, which they aren't. Wait, that seems contradictory. But in our previous substitution, when we set z = x³, then f(z) - f(z -2) is a cubic polynomial in z, but the RHS is [f(x)]² +12, which is a degree 6 polynomial in x, which is equivalent to a degree 2 polynomial in z (since x³ = z, so x = z^{1/3}, so x² = z^{2/3}, etc.). Therefore, how can a cubic polynomial in z equal a polynomial of degree 2/3 in z? That seems impossible unless all coefficients except z^{0} are zero, but in our solution, the coefficients did cancel out. Wait, maybe this suggests that only specific polynomials satisfy this equation, and in our case, the cubic polynomial works because the equation ends up being an identity when substituting the found coefficients. 

Alternatively, perhaps the only way for this equation to hold is if the RHS, when expressed in terms of z, is actually a cubic polynomial. But [f(x)]² +12, when x is expressed in terms of z, is [f(z^{1/3})]^2 +12, which would be a polynomial in z^{1/3}, but unless f(z^{1/3}) is a linear function in z^{1/3}, then [f(z^{1/3})]^2 would be quadratic in z^{1/3}, leading to z^{2/3}, which is not a polynomial in z. However, in our solution, f(z^{1/3}) = 6z^{1/3} -6, so [f(z^{1/3})]^2 = 36z^{2/3} -72z^{1/3} +36, which is not a polynomial in z. However, when we subtract f(z -2) from f(z), we get 4a z^{1/3} + ... Wait, no. Wait, in our substitution earlier, when we set z = x³, then f(z) - f(z -2) is 4a z + (-4a + 2b). Wait, no, that was when we considered f as linear. Wait, perhaps the confusion arises from the substitution. Let me clarify.

Wait, when we set z = x³, then x³ = z, so x = z^{1/3}. Then f(z) - f(z -2) is supposed to equal [f(x)]² +12. So, in terms of z, the left side is f(z) - f(z -2), which is a function of z, and the right side is [f(z^{1/3})]^2 +12. So, unless z^{1/3} is linear in z, which it isn't, how can these two sides be equal? It seems like a functional equation that's only possible if both sides are constants or something. But our solution worked because when we expanded everything, the terms coincided. So even though the right side is not a polynomial in z, when expressed in terms of x, it becomes a polynomial in x, which is compatible with the left side expressed in terms of z = x³. 

This seems a bit confusing, but since we found a valid solution through substitution and equating coefficients, and verified it, maybe that's the only solution. Let me check if there could be another polynomial of higher degree. Suppose f is a quartic polynomial. But wait, in our previous steps, when we considered cubic, the equation forced the coefficients of higher degrees (x^9) to cancel out. If we assumed a higher degree, say quartic, then f(z) - f(z -2) would have higher degrees, but the RHS [f(x)]² would have even higher degrees. However, since we found a solution with a cubic, and the problem specifies that f is a polynomial, maybe cubic is the only possibility. 

Alternatively, maybe the functional equation implies that f must be a cubic polynomial. Let me check the degrees. Let's suppose f is a polynomial of degree n. Then, f(x³) is degree 3n, and f(x³ -2) is also degree 3n. Therefore, the left-hand side f(x³) - f(x³ -2) is a polynomial of degree 3n. The right-hand side [f(x)]² +12 is a polynomial of degree 2n. For these two polynomials to be equal for all x, their degrees must be equal. Therefore, 3n = 2n ⇒ n = 0. But f is non-constant, so this is impossible. Wait, this suggests that there is no such polynomial, but we found one. Contradiction. 

Wait, this is a problem. If f is a non-constant polynomial, then 3n = 2n ⇒ n=0, which is impossible. But we found a cubic polynomial that works. How is this possible? There must be a mistake here. Wait, in our solution, f is cubic, so n=3. Then 3n=9, and 2n=6. But in our case, the left-hand side was 4a x³ + ... Wait, no. Wait, when we did the substitution earlier for the cubic case, the left-hand side ended up being a cubic polynomial in z =x³, but when expressed in terms of x, it's 6a x^6 + ... Wait, no, wait. Let me check again.

Wait, when we set f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, then f(x³) - f(x³ -2) was found to be 6a x^6 + (-12a +4b)x³ + (8a -4b +2c). But x^6 is (x³)^2, which is z² if z = x³. However, the right-hand side [f(x)]² +12 is (a x³ + ...)^2 +12, which is a quadratic in x³, so in terms of z, it's a quadratic in z. But the left-hand side is cubic in z. Wait, but in our case, we had 6a x^6 + ... which is quadratic in z. Wait, but when we set z = x³, x^6 = z². Therefore, LHS is 6a z² + (-12a +4b) z + (8a -4b +2c). The RHS is [f(x)]² +12 = (a x³ + b x² + c x + d)^2 +12. But x³ = z, so x² = z^{2/3}, x = z^{1/3}. Therefore, RHS is [a z + b z^{2/3} + c z^{1/3} + d]^2 +12. Which is a polynomial in z^{1/3}, but not in z unless the exponents are integers. However, in our solution, the coefficients of z^{2/3} and z^{1/3} must be zero. Let's check.

In our solution, a=6, b=0, c=0, d=-6. Therefore, f(x) =6x³ -6. Then [f(x)]² +12 = (6x³ -6)^2 +12 =36x^6 -72x³ +36 +12=36x^6 -72x³ +48. Expressed in terms of z =x³, this is 36 z² -72 z +48. The left-hand side is f(z) - f(z -2) =6z³ -6 - [6(z -2)^3 -6]. Let's compute this:

f(z) =6z³ -6.

f(z -2) =6(z -2)^3 -6 =6(z³ -6z² +12z -8) -6 =6z³ -36z² +72z -48 -6 =6z³ -36z² +72z -54.

Therefore, f(z) - f(z -2) = (6z³ -6) - (6z³ -36z² +72z -54) =6z³ -6 -6z³ +36z² -72z +54=36z² -72z +48. Which matches the RHS. So even though when expressed in terms of z^{1/3}, the RHS has fractional exponents, when z is a variable, the equation is 36z² -72z +48 =36z² -72z +48, which is valid. So in this case, even though x is expressed as z^{1/3}, the equation holds as polynomials in z. Therefore, even though the substitution seems to involve fractional exponents, the equation simplifies to a polynomial in z, which is valid. So this works.

Therefore, the degree analysis earlier was flawed because I considered the degree in z when f is expressed in terms of x, but when equating the two sides, they both become polynomials in z. Hence, the degree equality holds because 3n = 2n + something? Wait, no. Wait, if f is cubic, then [f(x)]² is degree 6, and f(x³) -f(x³ -2) is degree 6 as well (since x³ is degree 3, so f(x³) is degree 9, but when subtracted, the leading terms cancel, leaving degree 6). Wait, in our case, f(x³) -f(x³ -2) was degree 6, and [f(x)]² was degree 6. So the degrees do match. So in general, if f is degree n, then f(x³) -f(x³ -2) is degree 3n, but [f(x)]² is degree 2n. Therefore, 3n = 2n ⇒ n=0, which contradicts f being non-constant. But in our case, n=3, but the degree of f(x³) -f(x³ -2) is 6, which is 2n, not 3n. Wait, so how does that work?

Wait, in our case, f(x) is cubic, so f(x³) is degree 9, but when we subtract f(x³ -2), the leading terms (degree 9) cancel out, leaving the next highest degree term, which is 6. So the degree of f(x³) -f(x³ -2) is 6, which is equal to 2n (since n=3). Therefore, the degree equality is 2n = 2n, which is okay. So in general, if f is degree n, then f(x³) -f(x³ -2) is degree 3n - 3 if n ≥1, because expanding f(x³) and subtracting f(x³ -2) will eliminate the leading term (degree 3n) and leave the next term, which is degree 3n -3. Therefore, equating this to [f(x)]² +12, which is degree 2n, we have 3n -3 = 2n ⇒ n =3. So only cubic polynomials satisfy this degree condition. Therefore, this suggests that only cubic polynomials can satisfy the equation, and our found solution is the only one. 

Therefore, f(x) =6x³ -6 is the unique solution, and f(5) =6*(125) -6=750 -6=744. Thus, the answer is 744.

","Okay, so I need to find f(5) given that f is a non-constant polynomial satisfying the equation f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12 for all x. Hmm, let's try to figure this out step by step.

First, since f is a polynomial and the equation holds for all x, maybe I can start by assuming the degree of f. Let's denote the degree of f as n. Then, f(x³) would have degree 3n, and f(x³ - 2) would also have degree 3n because substituting x³ - 2 into a polynomial doesn't change the degree. On the right side, [f(x)]² has degree 2n. So, the left side has degree 3n, and the right side has degree 2n. For these two sides to be equal for all x, their degrees must be equal. Therefore, 3n = 2n, which implies n = 0. But wait, the problem states that f is non-constant, so n can't be zero. That's a contradiction. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let me check again. The left-hand side (LHS) is f(x³) - f(x³ - 2). If f is a polynomial of degree n, then f(x³) is degree 3n, and f(x³ - 2) is also degree 3n. When we subtract two polynomials of the same degree, the leading terms might cancel out. So the degree of the LHS could be less than 3n. Similarly, the right-hand side (RHS) is [f(x)]², which is degree 2n. So, to have equality, the degree of the LHS must equal the degree of the RHS. Therefore, 3n - k = 2n, where k is the degree lost due to cancellation in the LHS. But unless k = n, this would require 3n - k = 2n => k = n. But k is the degree lost, which is at least 0. So, unless the leading terms of f(x³) and f(x³ - 2) cancel each other, which would require that the coefficients are equal. Let's think about that.

Suppose f(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0. Then f(x³) = a_n x^{3n} + ... + a_0, and f(x³ - 2) = a_n (x³ - 2)^n + ... + a_0. The difference between these two would be f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = a_n [x^{3n} - (x³ - 2)^n] + ... lower terms. For the leading terms to cancel, we need [x^{3n} - (x³ - 2)^n] to have degree less than 3n. Let's expand (x³ - 2)^n. The leading term is x^{3n}, and the next term is -2n x^{3n - 1}. So, x^{3n} - (x³ - 2)^n = x^{3n} - [x^{3n} - 2n x^{3n - 1} + ...] = 2n x^{3n - 1} + lower terms. Therefore, the leading term of the difference is 2n x^{3n - 1}, so the degree of the LHS is 3n - 1. On the other hand, the RHS has degree 2n. Therefore, we have 3n - 1 = 2n => n = 1. So n must be 1? Wait, but then f is a linear polynomial. Let's check if that's possible.

If n = 1, then f(x) = ax + b. Let's plug into the equation:

Left-hand side: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a x³ + b] - [a (x³ - 2) + b] = a x³ + b - a x³ + 2a - b = 2a.

Right-hand side: [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x + b)^2 + 12 = a² x² + 2ab x + b² + 12.

But the LHS is 2a, which is a constant, and the RHS is a quadratic in x. For these to be equal for all x, the coefficients of x² and x on the RHS must be zero, and the constant term must equal 2a. So:

Coefficient of x²: a² = 0 => a = 0, but f is non-constant, so a ≠ 0. Contradiction. Therefore, n = 1 is impossible. Hmm, so my previous conclusion was wrong. Then maybe the degree is higher?

Wait, maybe I made an error in assuming the cancellation only occurs at the leading term. Let me think again. If f is a polynomial of degree n, then f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) is a polynomial of degree at most 3n - 1, as we saw. But the right-hand side is a polynomial of degree 2n. Therefore, equating degrees, 3n - 1 = 2n => n = 1, but we saw that n=1 doesn't work. Therefore, there must be another way.

Alternatively, maybe f is a constant polynomial? But the problem states f is non-constant. So that's not allowed. Therefore, perhaps there's a mistake in my approach.

Wait, let's consider possible types of polynomials. Maybe f is quadratic? Let's try n=2. Suppose f(x) is quadratic, so f(x) = a x² + b x + c.

Compute LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a x^6 + b x³ + c] - [a (x³ - 2)^2 + b (x³ - 2) + c].

Expand (x³ - 2)^2: x^6 - 4x³ + 4.

So f(x³ - 2) = a(x^6 - 4x³ + 4) + b(x³ - 2) + c = a x^6 -4a x³ +4a + b x³ -2b + c.

Therefore, LHS = [a x^6 + b x³ + c] - [a x^6 -4a x³ +4a + b x³ -2b + c] = (a x^6 - a x^6) + (b x³ +4a x³ - b x³) + (c -4a +2b -c) = 4a x³ + (-4a + 2b).

So the LHS is a cubic polynomial: 4a x³ + ( -4a + 2b ).

The RHS is [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x² + b x + c)^2 + 12. Expanding that: a² x^4 + 2ab x³ + (2ac + b²) x² + 2bc x + (c² + 12).

So equating LHS and RHS:

Cubic term: 4a x³ must equal 2ab x³. Therefore, 4a = 2ab => 4 = 2b => b = 2.

Quadratic term: On LHS, there is no quadratic term, so coefficient is 0. On RHS, coefficient is (2ac + b²). Therefore, 2ac + b² = 0. Since b=2, this becomes 2ac + 4 = 0 => ac = -2.

Linear term: LHS has no linear term, so coefficient is 0. On RHS, coefficient is 2bc. So 2b c = 0. Since b=2, this implies c = 0.

Constant term: On LHS, the constant term is (-4a + 2b). On RHS, the constant term is c² + 12. So, -4a + 2b = c² + 12. Plugging b=2 and c=0: -4a + 4 = 0 + 12 => -4a = 8 => a = -2.

So from ac = -2 and a = -2, c = (-2)/a = (-2)/(-2) = 1. Wait, but earlier we had c = 0 from the linear term. Contradiction. So c cannot be both 0 and 1. Therefore, quadratic polynomial is impossible. Therefore, n=2 doesn't work.

Hmm, moving on. Let's try n=3. Suppose f is a cubic polynomial: f(x) = a x³ + b x² + c x + d.

Compute LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2). Let's compute f(x³) = a x^9 + b x^6 + c x³ + d.

Compute f(x³ - 2): substitute x³ - 2 into f(x):

a(x³ - 2)^3 + b(x³ - 2)^2 + c(x³ - 2) + d.

Expand each term:

(x³ - 2)^3 = x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x³ - 8

(x³ - 2)^2 = x^6 - 4x³ + 4

Therefore, f(x³ - 2) = a(x^9 -6x^6 +12x³ -8) + b(x^6 -4x³ +4) + c(x³ -2) + d

= a x^9 -6a x^6 +12a x³ -8a + b x^6 -4b x³ +4b + c x³ -2c + d

Combine like terms:

x^9: a x^9

x^6: (-6a + b) x^6

x³: (12a -4b + c) x³

Constants: -8a +4b -2c + d

Therefore, f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a x^9 + b x^6 + c x³ + d] - [a x^9 -6a x^6 +12a x³ -8a + b x^6 -4b x³ +4b + c x³ -2c + d]

Compute term by term:

x^9: a - a = 0

x^6: b - (-6a + b) = b +6a - b = 6a

x³: c - (12a -4b + c) = c -12a +4b -c = -12a +4b

Constants: d - (-8a +4b -2c + d) = d +8a -4b +2c -d = 8a -4b +2c

Therefore, LHS is 6a x^6 + (-12a +4b)x³ + (8a -4b +2c)

The RHS is [f(x)]² + 12. Let's compute [f(x)]²:

(a x³ + b x² + c x + d)^2 = a² x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b²) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x^3 + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + d²

Adding 12 gives:

a² x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b²) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x^3 + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + (d² + 12)

So equate LHS and RHS:

x^6 term: 6a = a² => a² -6a =0 => a(a -6)=0 => a=0 or a=6. But f is non-constant, so a≠0. Therefore, a=6.

x^5 term: On LHS, there is no x^5 term, so coefficient is 0. On RHS, coefficient is 2ab. Therefore, 2ab =0. Since a=6, 2*6*b=0 => b=0.

x^4 term: On LHS, coefficient is 0. On RHS, coefficient is 2ac + b². With a=6, b=0: 2*6*c +0=12c. Therefore, 12c=0 => c=0.

x^3 term: On LHS, coefficient is -12a +4b. With a=6, b=0: -72 +0 = -72. On RHS, coefficient is 2ad + 2bc. With a=6, b=0, c=0: 2*6*d +0=12d. Therefore, 12d = -72 => d = -6.

x² term: On LHS, coefficient is 0. On RHS, coefficient is 2bd + c². With b=0, c=0: 0 +0=0. Okay, that's good.

x term: On LHS, coefficient is 0. On RHS, coefficient is 2cd. With c=0, d=-6: 0 +0=0. Okay.

Constant term: On LHS, 8a -4b +2c. With a=6, b=0, c=0: 48 -0 +0=48. On RHS, constant term is d² +12. With d=-6: (-6)^2 +12=36+12=48. Perfect, matches.

So all coefficients match. Therefore, the polynomial f(x) is:

f(x) = 6x³ +0x² +0x -6 =6x³ -6.

Now, check if this satisfies the original equation.

Let's compute f(x³) - f(x³ -2):

f(x³) =6(x³)^3 -6 =6x^9 -6

f(x³ -2)=6(x³ -2)^3 -6

Compute (x³ -2)^3 =x^9 -6x^6 +12x³ -8

Therefore, f(x³ -2)=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -48 -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54

Therefore, f(x³) -f(x³ -2)= (6x^9 -6) - (6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54)=6x^9 -6 -6x^9 +36x^6 -72x³ +54=36x^6 -72x³ +48

On the other hand, [f(x)]² +12=(6x³ -6)^2 +12=36x^6 -72x³ +36 +12=36x^6 -72x³ +48. Yes, they match. Therefore, f(x)=6x³ -6 is a solution.

Now, the problem asks for f(5). Compute f(5)=6*(5)^3 -6=6*125 -6=750 -6=744.

Therefore, the answer is 744. Let me just verify once more to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

Yes, 5^3 is 125, 6*125 is 750, 750 -6 is 744. Correct. And the polynomial checks out. So f(5)=744.

Given a non-constant polynomial function \\( f(x) \\) such that \\( f(x^3) - f(x^3 - 2) = [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\) for all \\( x \\), we need to find \\( f(5) \\).

First, we assume \\( f(x) \\) is a cubic polynomial of the form \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\). We compute the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the given equation.

1. **Compute \\( f(z) - f(z - 2) \\)**:

   - \\( f(z - 2) = a(z - 2)^3 + b(z - 2)^2 + c(z - 2) + d \\)
   - Expanding and simplifying \\( f(z - 2) \\):
     \\[
     f(z - 2) = a(z^3 - 6z^2 + 12z - 8) + b(z^2 - 4z + 4) + c(z - 2) + d
     \\]
     \\[
     = az^3 - 6az^2 + 12az - 8a + bz^2 - 4bz + 4b + cz - 2c + d
     \\]
   - Subtracting \\( f(z - 2) \\) from \\( f(z) \\):
     \\[
     f(z) - f(z - 2) = 6az^2 + (-12a + 4b)z + 8a - 4b + 2c
     \\]

2. **Substitute \\( z = x^3 \\)**:
   - LHS becomes \\( 6ax^6 + (-12a + 4b)x^3 + 8a - 4b + 2c \\).

3. **Expand \\( [f(x)]^2 + 12 \\)**:
   - \\( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \\)

   - Constants: \\( 8a - 4b + 2c = d^2 + 12 \\) confirms \\( d = -6 \\).

Thus, the polynomial is \\( f(x) = 6x^3 - 6 \\).

Finally, we compute \\( f(5) \\):
\\[
f(5) = 6(5)^3 - 6 = 6 \\cdot 125 - 6 = 750 - 6 = 744

","Okay, so I need to find f(5) given this polynomial equation: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [f(x)]² + 12 for all x. Hmm, let's start by understanding what kind of polynomial f(x) could satisfy this. The equation involves f evaluated at x³ and x³ - 2, which suggests that maybe f is a linear polynomial? But wait, it says f is non-constant, so linear is possible. Let me check.

Suppose f(x) is a linear polynomial, so f(x) = ax + b. Then let's compute both sides of the equation.

Left-hand side (LHS): f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = a(x³) + b - [a(x³ - 2) + b] = a x³ + b - a x³ + 2a - b = 2a.

Right-hand side (RHS): [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x + b)² + 12 = a² x² + 2ab x + (b² + 12).

So equating LHS and RHS: 2a = a² x² + 2ab x + (b² + 12). But this must hold for all x. However, the left side is a constant (2a), and the right side is a quadratic in x. The only way a quadratic equals a constant for all x is if all coefficients of x² and x are zero. So:

1. Coefficient of x²: a² = 0 ⇒ a = 0. But f is non-constant, so a can't be zero. Therefore, f(x) can't be linear. Hmm, so linear doesn't work. Maybe quadratic?

Let's try f(x) = ax² + bx + c. Then compute LHS and RHS.

First, LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2) = [a(x³)² + b(x³) + c] - [a(x³ - 2)² + b(x³ - 2) + c]

Compute each term:

a x^6 + b x³ + c - [a(x^6 - 4x³ + 4) + b x³ - 2b + c]

= a x^6 + b x³ + c - a x^6 + 4a x³ - 4a - b x³ + 2b - c

Simplify:

(a x^6 - a x^6) + (b x³ - b x³) + (c - c) + 4a x³ - 4a + 2b

= 4a x³ - 4a + 2b

So LHS simplifies to 4a x³ + (-4a + 2b).

RHS: [f(x)]² + 12 = (a x² + b x + c)² + 12

Expand that:

= a² x^4 + 2ab x³ + (2ac + b²) x² + 2bc x + c² + 12

So equate LHS and RHS:

4a x³ -4a + 2b = a² x^4 + 2ab x³ + (2ac + b²) x² + 2bc x + (c² + 12)

Again, this must hold for all x. Therefore, coefficients of corresponding powers of x must be equal.

Left side has x³, constants. Right side has x^4, x³, x², x, constants. So set coefficients equal:

- Coefficient of x^4: a² = 0 ⇒ a = 0. But if a = 0, then f(x) is linear, which we already saw doesn't work. So quadratic also doesn't work. Hmm.

Next, maybe cubic? Let's try f(x) = a x³ + b x² + c x + d.

Compute LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ - 2)

First, f(x³) = a (x³)^3 + b (x³)^2 + c x³ + d = a x^9 + b x^6 + c x³ + d

f(x³ - 2) = a (x³ - 2)^3 + b (x³ - 2)^2 + c (x³ - 2) + d

Expand each term:

(x³ - 2)^3 = x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x³ - 8

(x³ - 2)^2 = x^6 - 4x³ + 4

So f(x³ - 2) = a(x^9 - 6x^6 + 12x³ - 8) + b(x^6 - 4x³ + 4) + c(x³ - 2) + d

= a x^9 - 6a x^6 + 12a x³ - 8a + b x^6 - 4b x³ + 4b + c x³ - 2c + d

Now subtract f(x³ - 2) from f(x³):

LHS = [a x^9 + b x^6 + c x³ + d] - [a x^9 - 6a x^6 + 12a x³ - 8a + b x^6 - 4b x³ + 4b + c x³ - 2c + d]

Compute term by term:

a x^9 - a x^9 = 0

b x^6 - (-6a x^6 + b x^6) = b x^6 + 6a x^6 - b x^6 = 6a x^6

c x³ - (12a x³ - 4b x³ + c x³) = c x³ - 12a x³ + 4b x³ - c x³ = (-12a + 4b) x³

d - (-8a + 4b - 2c + d) = d + 8a - 4b + 2c - d = 8a - 4b + 2c

So overall, LHS = 6a x^6 + (-12a + 4b) x³ + 8a - 4b + 2c

Now compute RHS: [f(x)]² + 12

f(x) = a x³ + b x² + c x + d

[f(x)]² = (a x³ + b x² + c x + d)^2

Expanding this:

= a² x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b²) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x^3 + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + d²

Adding 12:

RHS = a² x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b²) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x^3 + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + (d² + 12)

Now set LHS equal to RHS for all x. Therefore, coefficients must match:

LHS: 6a x^6 + (-12a + 4b) x³ + (8a - 4b + 2c)

RHS: a² x^6 + 2ab x^5 + (2ac + b²) x^4 + (2ad + 2bc) x^3 + (2bd + c²) x² + 2cd x + (d² + 12)

So equate coefficients:

1. x^6: 6a = a² ⇒ a² - 6a = 0 ⇒ a(a -6) = 0 ⇒ a=0 or a=6. But since f is non-constant, a ≠0. So a=6.

2. x^5: 0 = 2ab ⇒ Since a=6, 2*6*b =0 ⇒ 12b=0 ⇒ b=0.

3. x^4: 0 = 2ac + b². Since a=6, b=0, this becomes 0 = 12c +0 ⇒ c=0.

4. x^3: -12a +4b = 2ad + 2bc. Substitute a=6, b=0, c=0:

Left: -12*6 +4*0 = -72

Right: 2*6*d + 2*0*0 =12d

So -72 =12d ⇒ d= -6.

5. x^2: 0 = 2bd + c². With b=0, c=0: 0=0 +0 ⇒ holds.

6. x: 0 = 2cd. With c=0: 0=0 ⇒ holds.

7. Constants: 8a -4b +2c = d² +12

Substitute a=6, b=0, c=0, d=-6:

Left:8*6 -0 +0=48

Right: (-6)^2 +12=36 +12=48

Yes, 48=48. So all equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the polynomial is f(x)=6x³ +0x² +0x -6=6x³ -6.

So f(x)=6x³ -6.

Check if this works. Let's verify with the original equation.

Compute LHS: f(x³) - f(x³ -2)

f(x³)=6(x³)^3 -6=6x^9 -6

f(x³ -2)=6(x³ -2)^3 -6=6(x^9 -6x^6 +12x³ -8) -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -48 -6=6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54

Subtract: (6x^9 -6) - (6x^9 -36x^6 +72x³ -54)=6x^9 -6 -6x^9 +36x^6 -72x³ +54=36x^6 -72x³ +48

Now compute RHS: [f(x)]² +12=(6x³ -6)^2 +12=36x^6 -72x³ +36 +12=36x^6 -72x³ +48

Yes, both sides equal 36x^6 -72x³ +48. So the polynomial works.

Therefore, f(x)=6x³ -6. Then f(5)=6*(5)^3 -6=6*125 -6=750 -6=744.

Wait, but let me check again. 5 cubed is 125. 6*125=750. 750-6=744. So f(5)=744.

But hold on, the problem statement says ""find f(5)"", and according to my solution, that's 744. But the user wrote at the end ""Return your final answer within \\boxed{}"". So maybe 744 is correct. Let me check once more.

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me compute 6*125:

125*6: 100*6=600, 25*6=150, so 600+150=750. Then 750-6=744. Yes, correct.

But let me check if the polynomial is indeed correct. Let's test x=0.

Original equation: f(0) - f(-2) = [f(0)]² +12

Compute f(0)=6*0 -6=-6

f(-2)=6*(-2)^3 -6=6*(-8) -6=-48 -6=-54

So LHS: -6 - (-54)= -6 +54=48

RHS: (-6)^2 +12=36 +12=48. Correct.

Another test: x=1.

f(1)=6*1 -6=0

LHS: f(1) - f(-1)=0 - (6*(-1)^3 -6)=0 - (-6 -6)=0 -(-12)=12

RHS: [f(1)]² +12=0 +12=12. Correct.

Another test: x=2.

f(2)=6*8 -6=48 -6=42

LHS: f(8) - f(6)=6*512 -6 - (6*216 -6)=3072 -6 -1296 +6=3072 -1296=1776

RHS: (42)^2 +12=1764 +12=1776. Correct.

So all tests pass. Therefore, f(5)=744. So the answer is 744.

","Okay, so I need to figure out all values of p > 0 such that log x is in the L^p space on the interval (0,1). Hmm, let's start by recalling what it means for a function to be in L^p. The L^p space consists of all measurable functions f on the space (here, (0,1)) for which the integral of |f|^p is finite. So, in this case, we need to check when the integral from 0 to 1 of |log x|^p dx is finite.

First, since log x is negative on the interval (0,1), |log x| is just -log x. So we can rewrite the integral as the integral from 0 to 1 of (-log x)^p dx. Let's denote that integral as I = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx.

Now, I should probably try to compute this integral and see for which p it converges. But how do I compute this integral? Maybe substitution? Let me think. Let's set t = -log x. Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches +∞, and when x = 1, t = 0. So the substitution would be x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. Let's adjust the limits accordingly. When x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from ∞ to 0. Therefore, the integral becomes:

I = ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt.

Wait, but that integral is the Gamma function! Because Γ(z) = ∫₀^∞ t^{z-1} e^{-t} dt. So here, if we set z - 1 = p, then z = p + 1. Therefore, I = Γ(p + 1). But the Gamma function Γ(p + 1) is equal to p! when p is a positive integer. However, the Gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except non-positive integers. So for real numbers p > -1, Γ(p + 1) is finite. But in our case, p > 0, so p + 1 > 1, so Γ(p + 1) is definitely finite. Therefore, the integral I converges for all p > 0.

Wait a minute, that seems too straightforward. But according to this substitution, the integral becomes the Gamma function, which is convergent for p > -1. Since we have p > 0 here, that would mean the integral converges for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, let me check this again. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let's go through the substitution step-by-step.

Starting with x in (0,1). Let t = -log x. Then x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. When x approaches 0, t approaches ∞; when x = 1, t = 0. Therefore, changing the limits:

∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt.

Yes, that's correct. So the integral is indeed Γ(p + 1). And Γ(p + 1) is finite for p + 1 > 0, i.e., p > -1. Since we are considering p > 0, then the integral converges. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, intuitively, log x behaves like -1/x near 0. So near 0, |log x|^p behaves like (1/x)^p. Then, integrating (1/x)^p from 0 to 1, we would have a problem if p >= 1, because the integral diverges. Wait, this contradicts the previous result. Which one is correct?

Let me check again. When x approaches 0, log x approaches -infty, so |log x| ~ -log x. So near 0, |log x|^p ~ (-log x)^p. But in terms of the substitution we did earlier, we saw that the integral converges for all p > 0. But maybe there's a mistake in the substitution approach. Let me verify the integral in another way.

Alternatively, let's consider the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let's make a substitution y = -log x, so x = e^{-y}, dx = -e^{-y} dy. Then, as before, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ y^p e^{-y} dy, which is Γ(p + 1). So if Γ(p + 1) is finite, then the integral is finite. But Γ(p + 1) is finite for all p > -1. So for p > 0, this is true. Therefore, the integral converges.

But wait, if we consider the behavior near 0: |log x|^p ~ (1/x)^p as x approaches 0. Then the integral near 0 would behave like ∫₀^ε (1/x)^p dx. Let's compute that. If p = 1, then ∫₀^ε (1/x) dx diverges. If p < 1, then ∫₀^ε (1/x)^p dx = ∫₀^ε x^{-p} dx = [x^{1 - p}/(1 - p)] from 0 to ε. If 1 - p > 0, i.e., p < 1, then the integral converges. If p > 1, it diverges. If p = 1, it's log x which diverges.

Wait, this is conflicting with the previous result. According to the substitution, the integral converges for all p > 0, but according to this local analysis near 0, if we think of |log x|^p ~ (1/x)^p, then the integral near 0 converges only if p < 1. But according to the substitution, the integral converges for all p > 0. So there must be a mistake in reasoning.

Wait, let me check again. When x approaches 0, log x approaches -infty, so |log x| ~ -log x. So |log x|^p ~ (-log x)^p. Let's compare this to (1/x)^p. Since x = e^{-t}, so t = -log x. Therefore, x = e^{-t} => t = -log x. Therefore, t ~ -log x. So as x approaches 0, t approaches infinity. Therefore, (-log x)^p = t^p. So near x = 0, |log x|^p = t^p, which is t^p. But the substitution shows that the integral over x from 0 to 1 becomes the integral over t from 0 to infinity of t^p e^{-t} dt. So even though near t = infinity (x approaching 0), the integrand is t^p e^{-t}, which decays exponentially, so the integral converges for all p. Therefore, the previous local analysis was incorrect because I was approximating |log x|^p as (1/x)^p, which is not correct. Actually, |log x|^p is not (1/x)^p near 0. Let me see:

Wait, x approaching 0, log x ~ -1/x? No, wait, log x approaches -infty, but the rate? Let's see, for x approaching 0 from the right, log x ~ - (1/x) as x approaches 0? No, that's not correct. Wait, actually, log x approaches -infty as x approaches 0, but the rate is logarithmic. So log x approaches -infty slower than any power of x. For example, lim_{x→0+} (log x)/(1/x^a) = 0 for any a > 0. Therefore, |log x| is much smaller than (1/x)^a for any a > 0 as x approaches 0. Therefore, |log x|^p is much smaller than (1/x)^{ap} for any a > 0. Therefore, the integral of |log x|^p near 0 is actually convergent for any p > 0, because the integrand decays polynomially (or even slower) but multiplied by an exponential decay in the substitution. Wait, but according to the substitution, it's equivalent to the Gamma function, which converges for all p > -1. Therefore, the confusion arises from the initial incorrect approximation.

Therefore, the integral converges for all p > 0, so log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

Wait, but let me check with p = 1. The integral ∫₀¹ |log x| dx. Let's compute this directly. Let x = e^{-t}, so t = -log x. Then dx = -e^{-t} dt. The integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t e^{-t} dt = Γ(2) = 1! = 1. So it converges. If p = 2, similar substitution gives Γ(3) = 2! = 2. So converges. If p = 1/2, Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π. Also converges. If p = 100, Γ(101) is a huge number, but still finite. Therefore, regardless of p > 0, the integral converges. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But then why when I thought about |log x|^p ~ (1/x)^p near 0, which would make the integral divergent for p >= 1? Because that approximation was wrong. The actual behavior is that |log x|^p grows slower than (1/x)^p near 0. So even though (1/x)^p is a very rapidly growing function, |log x|^p is actually growing much slower. Therefore, the integral of |log x|^p over (0,1) is finite for all p > 0.

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. Hence, all p > 0 satisfy the condition.

But wait, let me check another approach. Let's compute the integral ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx directly without substitution.

Let me compute I = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let's perform integration by parts. Let u = (-log x)^p, dv = dx. Then du = p (-log x)^{p-1} (-1/x) dx, and v = x. So:

I = uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [x (-log x)^p] from 0 to 1 - ∫₀¹ x * p (-log x)^{p-1} (-1/x) dx.

Evaluate the first term at 1: 1 * (-log 1)^p = 0. At 0: lim_{x→0+} x (-log x)^p. Since (-log x) → ∞, but x → 0. Let's see the limit:

lim_{x→0+} x (log(1/x))^p. Let t = log(1/x), so as x →0+, t → ∞, and x = e^{-t}. So the limit becomes lim_{t→∞} e^{-t} t^p = 0, since exponential decay dominates polynomial growth. Therefore, the first term is 0 - 0 = 0.

Now, the integral part: - ∫₀¹ x * p (-log x)^{p-1} (-1/x) dx = - ∫₀¹ p (-log x)^{p-1} dx = -p ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{p-1} dx.

But notice that ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{p-1} dx is similar to the original integral but with p replaced by p - 1. Let's denote I_{p} = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Then the above gives I_p = -p I_{p - 1}.

Wait, but this seems like a recursive relation. Let's check with p = 1:

I_1 = ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx. Then according to the recursion, I_1 = -1 * I_0. But I_0 = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^0 dx = ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1. Therefore, I_1 = -1 * 1 = -1? But that can't be, because the integral of a positive function should be positive. Wait, there must be an error in the sign.

Wait, let's go back. The integration by parts:

I = uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du.

I = [x (-log x)^p] from 0 to 1 - ∫₀¹ x * p (-log x)^{p-1} (-1/x) dx.

The first term is 0 - 0 = 0. The integral term is:

- ∫₀¹ x * p (-log x)^{p-1} (-1/x) dx = - ∫₀¹ p (-log x)^{p-1} (-1) dx = - ∫₀¹ (-p) (-log x)^{p-1} dx = p ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{p-1} dx.

Therefore, I_p = p I_{p - 1}.

Ah, okay, I messed up the signs. So the correct recursion is I_p = p I_{p - 1}.

Therefore, with I_0 = 1, then:

I_1 = 1 * I_0 = 1.

I_2 = 2 * I_1 = 2 * 1 = 2.

I_3 = 3 * I_2 = 3 * 2 = 6.

So in general, I_p = p! when p is a positive integer. Which aligns with the Gamma function result, since Γ(p + 1) = p! for positive integers p. Therefore, this recursion confirms that I_p is finite for all p > 0, not just integers. Because even if p is not an integer, the Gamma function is still finite for p > -1, so for p > 0, I_p = Γ(p + 1) is finite. Therefore, the integral converges for all p > 0.

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But just to make sure, let's test a specific value. Let's take p = 1/2. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{1/2} dx. Using substitution t = -log x, dx = -e^{-t} dt, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^{1/2} e^{-t} dt = Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π, which is finite. Similarly, for p = 2, Γ(3) = 2! = 2, which is finite. For p approaching 0, Γ(1) = 1, which is finite. So indeed, regardless of p > 0, the integral converges.

Therefore, all p > 0 satisfy the condition that log x is in L^p((0,1)).

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of p > 0 the function log x is in L^p on the interval (0,1). Hmm, L^p spaces are about the integral of |f|^p being finite, right? So, I need to check if the integral of |log x|^p over (0,1) converges. Since log x is negative on (0,1), |log x| would be -log x. So, the integral becomes the integral from 0 to 1 of (-log x)^p dx. 

First, let me recall what the log function does near 0 and 1. As x approaches 0 from the right, log x approaches negative infinity, so -log x approaches positive infinity. At x = 1, log x is 0. So near x = 0, the function is blowing up, but at x = 1, it's 0. Therefore, the main issue for convergence is the behavior near x = 0. The integral from 0 to 1 of (-log x)^p dx needs to be finite. 

I need to evaluate this integral. Let's make a substitution to simplify it. Let’s set t = -log x. Then, when x approaches 0+, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. Also, solving for x, we get x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, changing the limits of integration accordingly, the integral becomes:

Integral from t = infinity to t = 0 of t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = Integral from t = 0 to t = infinity of t^p e^{-t} dt.

Wait, that integral is the Gamma function! The Gamma function Γ(p+1) is equal to the integral from 0 to infinity of t^p e^{-t} dt. So, the original integral is equal to Γ(p+1). But the Gamma function Γ(p+1) is finite for all p > -1. Therefore, if p > -1, the integral converges. But since we are given that p > 0, which is a subset of p > -1, then the integral converges for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify this substitution again because sometimes there might be a mistake. Let me check the substitution step by step. If t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, when x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from infinity to 0. Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫_{x=0}^{x=1} (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{t=infty}^{t=0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫_{t=0}^{t=infty} t^p e^{-t} dt.

Yes, that's correct. So the integral is indeed Γ(p+1). And Γ(p+1) is defined and finite for all real numbers p + 1 > 0, i.e., p > -1. Therefore, since we are considering p > 0, which is within p > -1, the integral converges for all p > 0. Hence, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, another thought: sometimes when dealing with L^p spaces, especially on bounded domains, the behavior of the function is important. But in this case, the domain is (0,1), which is not compact, and the function has a singularity at 0. However, since we are able to perform the substitution and relate it to the Gamma function, which converges for p > -1, then as long as p > 0, it's okay. 

Alternatively, maybe I should check the integral directly without substitution. Let's consider the integral ∫_{0}^{1} (-log x)^p dx. Let's make another substitution, say y = -log x. Then x = e^{-y}, dx = -e^{-y} dy. When x=0, y=infty; x=1, y=0. So the integral becomes ∫_{infty}^{0} y^p (-e^{-y} dy) = ∫_{0}^{infty} y^p e^{-y} dy, which again is Γ(p+1). So same result. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that for all p > 0, the integral converges. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But wait, I should also consider the definition of L^p spaces. For a function to be in L^p, the integral of |f|^p must be finite. Since log x is negative on (0,1), |log x| = -log x, so we have the integral of (-log x)^p, which we just saw is equal to Γ(p+1), which is finite for p > -1. Therefore, since p > 0 is given, the integral is finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

Is there any possible mistake here? Let me check with specific values. For example, p = 1: ∫_{0}^{1} -log x dx. Let's compute this without substitution. Let’s integrate by parts. Let u = -log x, dv = dx. Then du = (-1/x) dx, v = x. So uv|_{0}^{1} - ∫_{0}^{1} v du = [x(-log x)]_{0}^{1} - ∫_{0}^{1} x*(-1/x) dx. 

At x=1: 1*(-0) = 0. At x=0: 0*(-log 0) but log 0 is -infty, but x approaches 0, so 0*(-infty). Hmm, indeterminate form. Let's compute the limit as x approaches 0 of x(-log x). Let’s set t = x, so t approaches 0. The expression is t*(-log t) = t*(-ln t). Let’s compute the limit: lim t→0+ t ln(1/t) = lim t→0+ t ln(1/t). Let’s set t = e^{-s}, as s approaches infinity. So t ln(1/t) = e^{-s} s, which approaches 0 as s→infty. Therefore, the limit at x=0 is 0. Therefore, the first term is 0 - 0 = 0. Then the integral becomes - ∫_{0}^{1} (-1) dx = ∫_{0}^{1} 1 dx = 1. So the integral is 1, which is finite. Therefore, p=1 works. 

Similarly, for p=2: ∫_{0}^{1} (-log x)^2 dx. Let's compute this. Again, substitution t = -log x. Then x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Integral becomes ∫_{0}^{infty} t^2 e^{-t} dt = Γ(3) = 2! = 2, which is finite. So p=2 works. 

For p approaching 0, say p approaching 0 from the right. Then the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{1} (-log x)^{p} dx. As p approaches 0, (-log x)^p approaches 1 for x in (0,1), but still, the integral would be ∫_{0}^{1} 1 dx = 1, but wait, actually, (-log x)^p is (e^{-t})^p = e^{-tp} where t = -log x. Wait, maybe I need to check the limit of the integral as p approaches 0. Wait, but for each p > 0, the integral is Γ(p+1) which approaches Γ(1) = 1 as p approaches 0. So the integral approaches 1, which is finite. Therefore, even as p approaches 0, the integral remains finite. 

Therefore, all p > 0 are acceptable. So the answer should be all p > 0. 

But let me check another perspective. Suppose I didn't recall the Gamma function. Let's try to compute the integral ∫_{0}^{1} (-log x)^p dx directly. Let’s set t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{infty} t^p e^{-t} dt, which is the Gamma function. But if I don't know the Gamma function, maybe I can use integration by parts. Let’s try integrating t^p e^{-t}. Let’s set u = t^p, dv = e^{-t} dt. Then du = p t^{p-1} dt, v = -e^{-t}. So uv|_{0}^{infty} - ∫_{0}^{infty} v du = [-t^p e^{-t}]_{0}^{infty} + p ∫_{0}^{infty} t^{p-1} e^{-t} dt. 

First term: At t=infty, t^p e^{-t} approaches 0 since exponential decays faster than any polynomial. At t=0, t^p e^{-t} approaches 0 since t^p approaches 0. So the first term is 0. Then the integral becomes p Γ(p). Therefore, Γ(p+1) = p Γ(p). So recursively, Γ(p+1) = p Γ(p) and Γ(1) = 1. Therefore, Γ(p) = (p-1)! for integer p, but for general p, it's just a generalization. 

But regardless, the key point is that Γ(p+1) converges for p + 1 > 0, i.e., p > -1. Therefore, for p > 0, the integral converges. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

Another way to think about it: near x = 0, log x ~ -log x, so the function behaves like (-log x)^p. The integral of (-log x)^p near 0 is equivalent to ∫_{0}^{epsilon} (-log x)^p dx. Let's substitute t = log(1/x), so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫_{t=infty}^{t=log(1/epsilon)} t^p e^{-t} dt, which is part of the Gamma function integral. As epsilon approaches 0, the upper limit goes to infinity, but the integral over t from log(1/epsilon) to infinity of t^p e^{-t} dt is finite because the integrand decays exponentially. Therefore, the integral near 0 converges if and only if the integral over t from 0 to infinity converges, which requires p > -1. Therefore, since p > 0, it's okay. 

Therefore, all p > 0 are acceptable. So the answer should be all p > 0. 

But let me check if there's a different approach. Suppose I use Hölder's inequality or some other inequality. Wait, maybe not necessary here. Alternatively, consider the function f(x) = log x on (0,1). To check if f is in L^p, compute ||f||_p = (∫_{0}^{1} |f(x)|^p dx)^{1/p}. As we saw, ∫_{0}^{1} |f(x)|^p dx = Γ(p+1), so ||f||_p = (Γ(p+1))^{1/p}. Since Γ(p+1) is positive and finite for p > -1, then ||f||_p is finite for p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

Alternatively, suppose someone argues that near x=0, log x behaves like -log x, so the integral near 0 is ∫_{0}^{a} (-log x)^p dx. Let’s set x = e^{-t}, then t = -log x, so when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity. Then the integral becomes ∫_{t=infty}^{t=-log a} t^p e^{-t} (-dt) = ∫_{t=-log a}^{t=infty} t^p e^{-t} dt. As a approaches 0, -log a approaches infinity, so the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{infty} t^p e^{-t} dt, which is Γ(p+1). So again, same result. 

Therefore, regardless of the substitution method, we end up with the Gamma function, which converges for p > -1. Therefore, since p > 0 is given, the answer is all p > 0. 

I think this is solid. All checks lead to the same conclusion. The integral converges for all p > 0, so log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

**Final Answer**
The function \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). Therefore, the solution is \\boxed{(0, \\infty)}.

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of p > 0 the logarithm function log x is in the L^p space on the interval (0,1). Hmm, let's start by recalling what L^p spaces are. The L^p space consists of all measurable functions f such that the integral of |f|^p over the space is finite. So, in this case, we need to check when the integral from 0 to 1 of |log x|^p dx is finite.

Wait, log x on (0,1) is actually negative because log of a number between 0 and 1 is negative. So |log x| would just be -log x. Therefore, the integral becomes the integral from 0 to 1 of (-log x)^p dx. But since we're dealing with absolute value, the integral is the same as integrating (-log x)^p. So the question reduces to finding all p > 0 such that ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx is finite.

Now, I need to evaluate this integral and see for which p it converges. Let me think about substitution here. Maybe a substitution would make the integral easier. Let's try substituting t = -log x. Let's see, if t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, and dx = -e^{-t} dt. When x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So changing the limits, the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt.

Wait, that's nice! The integral from 0 to infinity of t^p e^{-t} dt. That's the Gamma function Γ(p + 1). The Gamma function is defined for p > -1, but here p is given as p > 0, so for all p > 0, the integral converges. Therefore, does that mean that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0?

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The Gamma function Γ(p + 1) is finite for all p > -1, so yes, if p > 0, then Γ(p + 1) is finite. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx is finite for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because log x near 0 behaves like -log x, which goes to infinity. So for example, when p = 1, the integral is Γ(2) = 1! = 1, which is finite. For p = 2, Γ(3) = 2! = 2, which is also finite. So even though the function is large near 0, the integral is finite for any p > 0. Therefore, the answer should be all p > 0.

But wait, let me check with another approach. Maybe integrating without substitution. Let's compute ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let's make a substitution u = -log x, so x = e^{-u}, dx = -e^{-u} du. Then when x approaches 0, u approaches infinity, and when x = 1, u = 0. So the integral becomes ∫_{u=∞}^{u=0} u^p (-e^{-u} du) = ∫₀^∞ u^p e^{-u} du, which is indeed the Gamma function Γ(p + 1). So that's the same result as before.

But wait, the Gamma function is defined for p + 1 > 0, so p > -1. Since our p is given as p > 0, then yes, the integral converges. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, that seems surprising. Let me check with specific values. For example, if p = 1, the integral is ∫₀¹ -log x dx. Let's compute that. Let's integrate by parts. Let u = -log x, dv = dx. Then du = -1/x dx, v = x. So uv - ∫ v du = -x log x |₀¹ - ∫ (-x)(-1/x) dx = [ -x log x ]₀¹ - ∫ 1 dx. Evaluating from 0 to 1: At x=1, -1*log 1 = 0. At x=0, we have the limit as x approaches 0 from the right: -x log x. We know that x log x approaches 0 as x approaches 0, so the first term is 0 - 0 = 0. Then the integral becomes - ∫₀¹ 1 dx = -1. But since we're dealing with absolute values, the integral is 1. So ∫₀¹ (-log x)^1 dx = 1, which is finite. So p=1 is okay.

For p = 2, similarly, ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx. Let's compute that. Let's use substitution t = -log x again. Then the integral becomes Γ(3) = 2! = 2, which is finite. So p=2 is okay.

What about p approaching 0? For p approaching 0 from the right, the integral becomes Γ(1) = 1, which is still finite. So even as p approaches 0, the integral is finite. Therefore, the conclusion is that for all p > 0, the integral converges. Hence, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, the original question was to ""Determine all values of p > 0 such that log x ∈ L^p((0,1))"". And according to this, all p > 0. But the system message had a fraction 2/3. Wait, is that a typo or maybe a different question? Wait, no, the user just provided the question and then wrote ""frac{2}{3}$"", which might be an extra. Maybe the user was editing and left that in. Anyway, regardless, based on the calculation, the answer is all p > 0. But perhaps I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's think again. The function log x near 0 behaves like -log x, which is like 1/t as t approaches 0 (since if x approaches 0, t = -log x approaches infinity). Wait, maybe I need to check the behavior of the function near 0 and 1.

Wait, near x = 1, log x is near 0, so (-log x)^p is near 0. The main issue is near x = 0, where log x tends to -infty, so (-log x)^p tends to infinity. So we need to check the convergence of the integral near 0.

Let me make a substitution near 0. Let x = e^{-t}, so as x approaches 0, t approaches infinity. Then log x = -t, and dx = -e^{-t} dt. So the integral near 0 becomes ∫_{t=infty}^{t=0} (-log x)^p dx = ∫₀^infty t^p e^{-t} dt, which again is the Gamma function. So the integral converges for p + 1 > 0, so p > -1. Since p > 0, then yes, it converges. Therefore, the integral is finite for all p > 0.

Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. Therefore, the answer is all positive real numbers p.

But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check with p=1/2. Then the integral is Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π, which is finite. So yes, p=1/2 is okay. Similarly, p=3: Γ(4) = 6, finite. So regardless of how large or small p is, as long as p > 0, the Gamma function is finite.

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

**Final Answer**
The function $ \\log x $ is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). Thus, the solution is \\boxed{(0, \\infty)}.

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of p > 0 the function log x is in L^p((0,1)). Hmm, L^p spaces involve integrals of the absolute value of a function raised to the power p. So, the condition here is that the integral from 0 to 1 of |log x|^p dx must be finite. Since log x is negative on the interval (0,1), the absolute value would just be -log x. So, I need to check when the integral of (-log x)^p dx from 0 to 1 is finite.

First, let me recall that L^p((0,1)) consists of all functions f such that the integral of |f(x)|^p dx over (0,1) is finite. So, for our case, f(x) = log x, and we need to see for which p this integral converges.

The integral we need to evaluate is ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx. Since log x is negative between 0 and 1, |log x| = -log x. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let me write that down: ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. 

Now, I need to determine for which p > 0 this integral converges. To do that, I can try to compute the integral directly or perform a substitution to simplify it. Let's consider substitution. Let me set t = -log x. Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. Let's solve for x in terms of t: x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫ (from t = ∞ to t = 0) t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫ (from t = 0 to t = ∞) t^p e^{-t} dt.

Wait, that substitution seems to change the limits. Let me check again. If x goes from 0 to 1, then t = -log x goes from ∞ to 0. So, when x approaches 0, t approaches ∞, and when x = 1, t = 0. Therefore, the substitution gives:

∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{∞}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt.

Yes, that's correct. So, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt. Wait, but that's the Gamma function! The Gamma function Γ(p+1) is defined as ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt. And Γ(p+1) converges for all p > -1. However, in our case, p is given to be greater than 0. So, since p > 0, then p + 1 > 1, so Γ(p+1) is definitely convergent. Therefore, does that mean that for all p > 0, the integral ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx is finite?

Wait, but hold on. The Gamma function Γ(p+1) is indeed convergent for p > 0. Wait, but actually, Γ(s) converges for Re(s) > 0. So, if s = p + 1, then Re(s) > 0 when p + 1 > 0, so p > -1. But in our case, p is given to be greater than 0, so that's within the domain of convergence. Therefore, the integral converges for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0? That seems counterintuitive. Wait, but let me verify.

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check the substitution again. Let's take x approaching 0, so t = -log x approaches infinity. So, the substitution is correct. So, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which is Γ(p+1). So, as long as p + 1 > 0, which is p > -1. But since p > 0, it's certainly true. Therefore, the integral converges for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. But wait, that contradicts my intuition. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me try to compute the integral without substitution. Let's consider ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let me make a substitution u = -log x, so x = e^{-u}, dx = -e^{-u} du. When x approaches 0, u approaches infinity, and when x = 1, u = 0. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{∞}^0 u^p (-e^{-u} du) = ∫₀^∞ u^p e^{-u} du. Which is indeed Γ(p+1). So, as long as p + 1 > 0, which is p > -1. But since p > 0 is given, this integral is finite. Therefore, the answer is all p > 0.

But wait, but I remember that in some cases, functions like log x near 0 can have different behaviors. For example, near x = 0, log x behaves like -log x, which goes to infinity. So, the integral near 0 would be like ∫₀^ε (-log x)^p dx. Let me try to compute this part separately. Let me set t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches ∞, and x = ε, t = -log ε. So, the integral becomes ∫_{∞}^{-log ε} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫_{-log ε}^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt. Wait, but this is still part of the Gamma function integral. However, perhaps the convergence near 0 is only dependent on the behavior of the integrand as t approaches infinity. Wait, but as t approaches infinity, t^p e^{-t} decays exponentially, which is integrable. Therefore, the integral near 0 (which corresponds to large t) converges. Similarly, near x = 1, log x approaches 0, so (-log x)^p approaches 0, so there's no problem there. Therefore, the entire integral converges for all p > 0.

But wait, this seems conflicting with some other knowledge. Let me check with specific values of p. For example, take p = 1. Then, ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx. Let me compute that. Let u = -log x, then x = e^{-u}, dx = -e^{-u} du. The integral becomes ∫₀^∞ u e^{-u} du = Γ(2) = 1! = 1. So, that's finite. For p = 2, ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx. Similarly, substitution gives Γ(3) = 2! = 2. So, that's finite. For p = 0.5, Γ(0.5 + 1) = Γ(1.5) which is sqrt(π)/2, finite. So, indeed, all these integrals converge. Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check another approach. Let's consider the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let's make substitution z = log x, so x = e^z, dx = e^z dz. When x approaches 0, z approaches -infty, and when x = 1, z = 0. So, the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 (-z)^p e^z dz = ∫_{-infty}^0 |z|^p e^z dz. Let me change variables to t = -z, so t goes from 0 to infty, and the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which is Γ(p+1). Again, same result. Therefore, this seems to confirm that the integral converges for all p > -1. But since p > 0, then it's definitely convergent.

Therefore, the answer is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. Wait, but that seems to contradict some standard results. For example, I recall that functions whose integrals blow up near 0 can sometimes only be in L^p for certain p. For example, 1/sqrt(x) is in L^2 but not in L^1. But in this case, log x is more ""mild"" near 0. Wait, but log x near 0 behaves like -log x, which is more severe than 1/t near 0, but less severe than 1/t^2. Wait, actually, let's compare the growth rates.

Let me consider the behavior near x = 0. Let x approach 0, so log x approaches -infty. So, |log x| = -log x. Let me set t = -log x, so as x approaches 0, t approaches infty. Then, near x = 0, we can approximate the integral ∫₀^ε |log x|^p dx ≈ ∫_{-infty}^{-log ε} t^p e^{-t} dt. Wait, but this is part of the Gamma function integral again. However, as t approaches infinity, t^p e^{-t} decays exponentially, so the integral converges. Therefore, near 0, the integral is convergent. Therefore, the entire integral converges for any p > 0.

Therefore, my conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. Therefore, the answer is all p > 0. But wait, let me check with another example. Suppose p = 0. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ |log x|^0 dx = ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1, which is finite, but p > 0 is required. So, for p = 0, it's still finite, but p > 0 is the condition here.

Wait, but the problem states p > 0. So, even though p = 0 is allowed in the integral (as the integral is 1), the question is only asking for p > 0, so the answer is all p > 0. Therefore, the final answer is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, let me check another source or example. Suppose we have the function f(x) = log x on (0,1). Let me compute the integral for p = 1, which we saw is 1. For p = 2, it's 2. For p = 3, 6, etc., but as p approaches infinity, does the integral blow up? Wait, for p approaching infinity, the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let's see, as p becomes very large, the integrand (-log x)^p is highly concentrated near x = 0, since log x is negative and large in magnitude there. Wait, but actually, for each x in (0,1), (-log x) is positive, so as p increases, the integrand becomes larger for x where (-log x) is greater than 1, and smaller otherwise. Wait, but the integral might actually diverge as p increases? Wait, but according to the Gamma function, Γ(p+1) grows as p! which is infinite as p approaches infinity. Wait, but Γ(p+1) is finite for any finite p. So, even as p approaches infinity, as long as it's finite, the integral is finite. Therefore, for each finite p > 0, the integral is finite. Therefore, the answer is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

Therefore, despite my initial confusion, the conclusion is that all p > 0 are valid. So, I need to confirm once again. Let me take p = 1000. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^1000 dx = Γ(1001) which is 1000! which is a huge number, but still a finite number. Therefore, even though it's very large, it is finite. Therefore, the integral is finite for all p > 0.

Therefore, the answer is that all p > 0 satisfy log x ∈ L^p((0,1)).

**Final Answer**
The function \\( \\log x \\) belongs to \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). Therefore, the solution is \\(\\boxed{(0, \\infty)}\\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of p > 0 the logarithm function log x is in the Lebesgue space L^p on the interval (0,1). Let me start by recalling what L^p spaces are. A function f is in L^p((0,1)) if the integral of |f|^p over (0,1) is finite. So in this case, we need to check if the integral of |log x|^p dx from 0 to 1 is finite. 

First, since log x is negative on (0,1), |log x| would be equal to -log x. So the integral we need to evaluate is the integral from 0 to 1 of (-log x)^p dx. Let me write that down: ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. 

Hmm, to evaluate this integral, maybe a substitution would help. Let's let t = -log x. Then when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So the limits of integration will change accordingly. Let's solve for x in terms of t: if t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, and dx = -e^{-t} dt. But since the limits are going from infinity to 0, we can reverse them and get rid of the negative sign. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt. Wait, that's the Gamma function! The Gamma function Γ(p+1) is equal to ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt. 

So the integral we're looking at is Γ(p+1). Now, the Gamma function is defined for all complex numbers except non-positive integers. But since we have p > 0 here, and p+1 would be greater than 1, which is within the domain where the Gamma function is defined. However, the Gamma function Γ(z) is finite for all z > 0. Therefore, Γ(p+1) is finite for all p > 0. That would mean that the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx is finite for all p > 0, so log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. I remember that functions can be in some L^p spaces but not others. For example, functions in L^∞ are also in every L^p for p < ∞, but functions in L^1 might not be in L^2 if they have too much ""mass"". However, in this case, log x is not in L^1((0,1)) because the integral ∫₀¹ |log x| dx diverges, right? Let me check that. 

Calculating ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx. Let's use substitution again. Let t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t e^{-t} dt, which is Γ(2) = 1! = 1. Wait, that's finite. Wait, but that contradicts my initial thought. Wait, but if the integral is 1, then log x is in L^1((0,1)) because the integral is finite. Hmm, maybe my initial intuition was wrong. Let me recast this. 

Wait, let's actually compute ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx. Let's make substitution u = log x, so when x approaches 0, u approaches -infty, and at x = 1, u = 0. Then dx = e^u du. So the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 (-u) e^u du = ∫₀^infty u e^{-u} du, which is indeed Γ(2) = 1! = 1. So actually, log x is in L^1((0,1)) because the integral is 1. Then why did I think it wasn't? Maybe I was confused with something else. 

But according to the Gamma function result, for any p > 0, the integral Γ(p+1) is finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. Wait, but that seems strange because if p approaches infinity, does that affect the integrability? Let me check for p = 2. The integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx. Let's compute that. Again, substitution t = -log x, so the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^2 e^{-t} dt = Γ(3) = 2! = 2. So finite. Similarly, for p = 3, it would be Γ(4) = 6. So indeed, for any p > 0, the integral is finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But wait, let me check another source or recall if there's a theorem about logarithmic functions in L^p spaces. For example, functions that decay like |x|^{-a} near zero are in L^p if certain conditions on a and p are met. But here, log x behaves like -log x near zero. Wait, near zero, log x approaches -infty, but the function is integrable as we saw. So maybe the integral is okay. 

Alternatively, maybe we can compare log x to another function. Let's consider near zero, log x ~ -log x, and for x near zero, say x in (0,1), log x is negative and large in magnitude. However, when we take |log x|^p, which is (-log x)^p, and integrate over (0,1), the substitution shows that it's equivalent to integrating t^p e^{-t} from 0 to infinity, which is the Gamma function. Since Gamma(p+1) is finite for all p > -1, but here p > 0, so it's finite. 

Therefore, regardless of p > 0, the integral converges. Hence, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. Wait, but that seems to contradict some intuition. For example, if p is very large, does the integral still converge? Let's take p approaching infinity. But even as p approaches infinity, the Gamma function Γ(p+1) behaves like O(p^p e^{-p}) by Stirling's approximation, which is still finite. So even for very large p, the integral remains finite. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. But wait, let me check again. Wait, when p=1, the integral is 1, which is finite. When p=2, it's 2, which is finite. For p=3, 6, etc. So yes, all these are finite. Therefore, regardless of how large p is, the integral is finite. So the answer is that all p > 0. 

But let me check another angle. Suppose we didn't do substitution. Let's try integrating (-log x)^p dx from 0 to 1 directly. Maybe integration by parts. Let me set u = (-log x)^p and dv = dx. Then du = p (-log x)^{p-1} (1/x) dx, and v = x. So integration by parts gives uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du. That is [x (-log x)^p ]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ x p (-log x)^{p-1} (1/x) dx. The first term evaluated at 1 is 0, and as x approaches 0, x (-log x)^p. Let's see: as x approaches 0, -log x approaches infinity, but x approaches 0. The product is 0 * infinity, which is indeterminate. Let's write x (-log x)^p = (-log x)^p / (1/x). As x approaches 0, 1/x approaches infinity. So we have (-log x)^p / (1/x) = x (-log x)^p. Let me see if this goes to 0. Let's let t = -log x, so as x approaches 0, t approaches infinity. Then x = e^{-t}, so x (-log x)^p = e^{-t} t^p. As t approaches infinity, e^{-t} decays exponentially, which dominates any polynomial growth of t^p. Therefore, the limit is 0. Therefore, the first term is 0 - 0 = 0. 

Then the integral becomes - ∫₀¹ p (-log x)^{p-1} dx. Wait, that's -p ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{p-1} dx. But this is similar to the original integral. Let me denote I(p) = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Then according to integration by parts, I(p) = -p I(p-1). But wait, this suggests a recursive relation. However, we need to check if this is valid. 

Wait, let's check for p=1: I(1) = ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx = 1. Then according to the recursion, I(1) = -1 * I(0). But I(0) = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^0 dx = ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1. But then -1 * I(0) = -1, which contradicts I(1) = 1. So there must be a mistake in the integration by parts approach. 

Wait, maybe I messed up the signs. Let's redo the integration by parts. Let u = (-log x)^p, dv = dx. Then du = p (-log x)^{p-1} * (1/x) dx, and v = x. So uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du. uv at 1 is 0, and at 0 approaches 0 as we saw. Then the integral becomes - ∫₀¹ x * p (-log x)^{p-1} * (1/x) dx = -p ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{p-1} dx. So indeed, I(p) = -p I(p-1). But when p=1, I(1) = -1 * I(0) = -1 * 1 = -1, which contradicts the known result that I(1)=1. Therefore, there must be an error in the signs. 

Wait, let me check the substitution again. When we did the substitution t = -log x, then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which is Γ(p+1). But Γ(p+1) is positive for p > -1, so I(p) should be positive. However, the integration by parts gives I(p) = -p I(p-1), which would be negative if p is positive and I(p-1) is positive. Therefore, there's a contradiction here, which suggests that the integration by parts approach might have an error. 

Wait, perhaps the limits of integration were mishandled. Let's check the integration by parts again. The original integral is ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let u = (-log x)^p, dv = dx. Then du = p (-log x)^{p-1} * (1/x) dx, and v = x. Then uv|₀¹ is [x (-log x)^p ] from 0 to 1. At x=1, it's 0. At x=0, we saw that it's 0. So the first term is 0. Then the integral is - ∫₀¹ x * p (-log x)^{p-1} * (1/x) dx. The x and 1/x cancel out, leaving -p ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{p-1} dx. Therefore, I(p) = -p I(p-1). But since I(p) is positive, this would require that -p I(p-1) is positive, which would mean I(p-1) is negative. But I(p-1) is an integral of a positive function, so it's positive. Therefore, there's a contradiction. 

This suggests that the integration by parts might not be applicable here, or perhaps there's a mistake in the process. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in choosing u and dv. Let me try another substitution. Let's set t = log x, so when x approaches 0, t approaches -infty, and at x=1, t=0. Then dx = e^t dt. The integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 (-t)^p e^t dt = ∫_{-infty}^0 (-t)^p e^t dt. Let me substitute s = -t, so when t approaches -infty, s approaches +infty, and at t=0, s=0. Then the integral becomes ∫_{+infty}^0 s^p e^{-s} (-ds) = ∫₀^infty s^p e^{-s} ds = Γ(p+1). So this matches the previous result. Therefore, integration by parts must have an error. 

Wait, maybe the problem is that (-log x)^{p-1} is positive, but when p is positive, the integral is positive, and the integration by parts gives a negative sign. Therefore, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the integration by parts steps. Let me check again. 

Original integral: I(p) = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. 

Let u = (-log x)^p, dv = dx. Then du = p (-log x)^{p-1} (1/x) dx, and v = x. 

Then uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du. 

uv at 1 is 0, and at 0 approaches 0 as before. 

So uv term is 0. 

Then the integral becomes - ∫₀¹ x * p (-log x)^{p-1} (1/x) dx. 

Simplify the integrand: x * p (-log x)^{p-1} (1/x) = p (-log x)^{p-1}. 

Therefore, I(p) = -p ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{p-1} dx = -p I(p-1). 

But this leads to a contradiction because I(p) is positive and I(p-1) is positive, so we have a negative equals positive, which is impossible. 

Ah! Here's the mistake: when we perform substitution t = -log x, the integral becomes ∫₀^infty t^p e^{-t} dt, which is Γ(p+1). However, when we do integration by parts, we get I(p) = -p I(p-1). Therefore, this suggests that Γ(p+1) = -p Γ(p). But Γ(p+1) = p Γ(p), which is the well-known property of the Gamma function. Therefore, there must be a sign error in the integration by parts. 

Looking back, when we did the substitution t = -log x, we had:

x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, when changing variables from x to t, the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{infty}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^infty t^p e^{-t} dt = Γ(p+1).

But in the integration by parts, we ended up with I(p) = -p I(p-1). However, according to the Gamma function, Γ(p+1) = p Γ(p). Therefore, the correct relation should be I(p) = p I(p-1). Therefore, there must be an error in the integration by parts sign. 

Wait, let me redo the integration by parts carefully. 

Let u = (-log x)^p. Then du/dx = p (-log x)^{p-1} * (1/x). 

dv = dx, so v = x. 

Then uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du. 

uv at 1 is 0. At 0, as x approaches 0, u approaches 0 (since (-log x)^p * x = e^{-t} t^p, which approaches 0 as t approaches infinity). 

So the first term is 0. 

The integral becomes - ∫₀¹ x * p (-log x)^{p-1} (1/x) dx = -p ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{p-1} dx. 

But according to the Gamma function, this should be -p I(p-1). However, since Γ(p+1) = p Γ(p), we have I(p) = p I(p-1). Therefore, there is a discrepancy in the sign. 

Ah! The problem arises because when we integrated by parts, we ended up with a negative sign, but according to the substitution, it should be positive. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the integration by parts steps. 

Wait, let me check the substitution again. If we do substitution t = -log x, then dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, when we change the limits, when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{infty}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^infty t^p e^{-t} dt = Γ(p+1).

But if we do integration by parts, we get I(p) = -p I(p-1). However, Γ(p+1) = p Γ(p), so this suggests that -p I(p-1) = p Γ(p) => I(p-1) = -Γ(p). But Γ(p) is always positive for p > 0, so this would imply I(p-1) is negative, which contradicts the fact that I(p-1) is an integral of a positive function. 

Therefore, there must be a mistake in the integration by parts process. 

Wait, perhaps the error is in the definition of u and dv. Let me try another substitution. Let's set u = (-log x)^{p-1}, dv = x (-log x) dx. Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe another approach. 

Alternatively, let's consider the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let's make substitution t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^infty t^p e^{-t} dt = Γ(p+1). Therefore, the integral is Γ(p+1), which is finite for all p > -1. Since p > 0 in our problem, this integral is finite. Therefore, regardless of p > 0, log x is in L^p((0,1)). 

Therefore, the answer is that all p > 0 satisfy the condition. But wait, let me check for p=0.5. The integral would be Γ(1.5) = 0.5! = sqrt(π)/2, which is finite. For p approaching 0, Γ(p+1) approaches Γ(1) = 1. So even as p approaches 0, the integral remains finite. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But I need to confirm this with another method. Let's consider the behavior near 0 and near 1. Near x=1, log x is near 0, so |log x|^p is near 0, which is fine. Near x=0, log x approaches -infty, but the integral of |log x|^p dx near 0 is like ∫₀^ε (-log x)^p dx. Substitute t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫_{t=∞}^{t=-log ε} t^p e^{-t} (-dt) = ∫_{-log ε}^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt. As ε approaches 0, -log ε approaches infinity, so the integral from some large number to infinity of t^p e^{-t} dt. The integral ∫₀^infty t^p e^{-t} dt converges for all p > -1, so even the tail near infinity is integrable. Therefore, the integral near 0 is convergent. 

Therefore, combining both regions, the entire integral from 0 to 1 is convergent for all p > 0. 

Therefore, the answer is that all p > 0 are valid.

**Final Answer**
The function \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). The values of \\( p \\) are \\boxed{(0, \\infty)}.

To determine all values of \\( p > 0 \\) such that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\), we need to check if the integral \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx \\) converges. Since \\( \\log x \\) is negative on \\( (0,1) \\), we consider the integral \\( \\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^p dx \\).

We perform a substitution to analyze the integral. Let \\( t = -\\log x \\), which transforms the integral as follows:
- When \\( x \\) approaches 0, \\( t \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\).
- When \\( x = 1 \\), \\( t = 0 \\).
- The substitution gives \\( x = e^{-t} \\) and \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\).

Changing the limits of integration accordingly, we get:

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of p > 0 the function log x is in the L^p space on the interval (0,1). Hmm, L^p spaces are about the integrability of the absolute value of a function raised to the power p. So, basically, I need to check if the integral of |log x|^p dx from 0 to 1 converges. Since log x is negative on (0,1), |log x| is just -log x. So, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. I need to determine for which p this integral is finite.

Let me start by recalling some properties of logarithmic integrals. The function log x tends to -infinity as x approaches 0 from the right, and it's equal to 0 at x = 1. So, near x = 0, the function |log x| behaves like 1/x, but maybe with a logarithmic correction. Wait, actually, log x goes to -infinity as x approaches 0, so |log x| goes to infinity. But how does it compare to 1/x? Let's see, near x = 0, log x ≈ - (1 - x) for small x? Wait, no, that's the expansion for ln(1 - x). Maybe another approach: if I set t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, and when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity. So, maybe substituting variables here would help.

Let me try substitution. Let t = -log x, so that x = e^{-t}, and dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So, changing the limits accordingly, the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt

Wait, that seems like a standard Gamma function integral. The Gamma function Γ(p+1) is defined as ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which converges for p > -1. But here, we have p > 0, so since p is positive, p + 1 > 1, so the Gamma function is defined. Therefore, the integral converges for all p > 0. But wait, that can't be right because I remember that log x is not in L^p for all p. Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me check the substitution again. If t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then, when x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from ∞ to 0. So flipping the limits, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which is indeed the Gamma function Γ(p+1). The Gamma function converges for p > -1, so if p > 0, then the integral should converge. But wait, that contradicts my initial thought that log x is not in L^p for all p. Maybe I need to check again.

Wait, but when I evaluate the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx, perhaps there's a mistake here. Let's test p = 1. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx. Let's compute that. Let u = -log x, dv = dx. Then du = (-1/x) dx, v = x. Integration by parts: uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [x*(-log x)]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ x*(-1/x) dx = [0 - 0] + ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1. So that converges. For p = 2, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (log x)^2 dx. Let's compute that as well. Let u = (log x)^2, dv = dx. Then du = 2(log x)(-1/x) dx, v = x. Integration by parts: uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [x(log x)^2]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ x*2(log x)(-1/x) dx = [0 - 0] + 2∫₀¹ log x dx. We already know ∫₀¹ log x dx = -1, so this becomes 2*(-1) = -2. But since we're taking absolute value, |log x|^2 is the same as (log x)^2, so the integral is 2. So that converges as well. Hmm.

Wait, so maybe the integral does converge for all p > 0? But that contradicts my intuition. Let me check another source or think differently. Wait, perhaps the behavior near x = 0 is different. Let's analyze the integral near 0. Let x approach 0, so t = -log x approaches infinity. So the integral near 0 is equivalent to ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which is the Gamma function. The Gamma function Γ(p+1) converges for p > -1, so for p > 0, it's certainly convergent. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx is equal to Γ(p+1), which is finite for all p > -1. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. But that contradicts some of my prior knowledge. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, let's check for p = 1/2. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{1/2} dx. Let's perform substitution t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^{1/2} e^{-t} dt = Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π. Which is finite. So even for p = 1/2, the integral is finite. So perhaps my initial thought that log x is not in L^p for all p is wrong. Wait, maybe it's actually in L^p for all p > 0.

Wait, but let's check for very large p. Suppose p is a large positive number. Then, near x = 0, |log x|^p behaves like |log x|^p. But in the substitution, we saw that the integral becomes Γ(p+1), which for large p behaves like p^p e^{-p} √(2π p) by Stirling's approximation. So the integral does grow very rapidly, but it's still a finite number. Therefore, even though the integral grows with p, it's always finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. But that seems counterintuitive because near x = 0, log x is very negative, and raising it to a power p would make it even more negative, but since we're taking absolute value, it's positive. However, the integral still converges. So maybe the answer is all p > 0.

Wait, but let me check another approach. Suppose we don't use substitution. Let's consider the integral ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx. Let's split the integral into two parts: near x = 0 and near x = 1. Near x = 1, log x ≈ x - 1, so |log x|^p ≈ (x - 1)^p, which is integrable for any p > 0 because near x =1, it's like (1 - x)^p, and p > 0. So there's no problem near x =1. The potential problem is near x =0. Let's analyze the behavior near x =0.

As x approaches 0, log x approaches -infty, so |log x| approaches infinity. Let's see how |log x|^p behaves as x approaches 0. Let me set x = e^{-t}, so t approaches infinity as x approaches 0. Then |log x|^p = t^p. So the integral near x =0 is equivalent to ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which is the Gamma function, converges for p > -1. Therefore, near x =0, the integral converges for all p > -1, which includes p >0. Therefore, the entire integral converges for all p >0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p >0.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check with p =0. But p >0, so p=0 is not considered. For p approaching zero, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ |log x|^0 dx = ∫₀¹ 1 dx =1, which is finite. For p approaching infinity, the integral is still finite? Wait, but as p increases, the integrand |log x|^p becomes larger near x=0, but the integral still converges because the Gamma function converges for all p > -1. So yes, even for very large p, the integral is finite. Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p >0.

But wait, I recall that in some contexts, functions with logarithmic singularities are in L^p spaces for any p >0. For example, the function 1/x^a with a <1 is in L^p for certain p, but here the logarithm is a slower singularity. Wait, but in this case, the substitution shows that the integral is the Gamma function, which is finite for all p > -1. Therefore, the answer should be all p >0. So the initial problem is to determine all p >0 such that log x is in L^p((0,1)), and the answer is all p >0.

But wait, let me check with specific examples. Let p =1, as we did before, the integral is 1. For p =2, it's 2. For p =1/2, it's Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π. All finite. For p =100, it's Γ(101), which is 100! e^{-100} √(200π) approximately, but still finite. Therefore, yes, it converges for all p >0. Therefore, the answer is all p >0.

Wait, but the problem statement says ""Determine all values of p > 0 such that log x ∈ L^p((0,1))"" and the user provided the fraction 2/3. Maybe there was a typo, but the solution seems to be all p >0. Therefore, the final answer is all positive real numbers p.

But let me check again. Suppose someone claims that near x=0, the function |log x| is integrable only if p < something. Wait, but according to the substitution, the integral near x=0 is equivalent to the Gamma function, which is finite for all p > -1. Therefore, near x=0, the integral converges for all p > -1, so for p >0, which is included. Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p >0. Therefore, the answer is all p >0.

**Final Answer**
The values of \\( p \\) are all positive real numbers, so the answer is \\(\\boxed{(0, \\infty)}\\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of p > 0 the function log x is in the L^p space on the interval (0,1). Hmm. Let me start by recalling what L^p spaces are. The L^p space, denoted L^p(I), consists of all Lebesgue measurable functions on the interval I for which the p-th power of the absolute value is Lebesgue integrable. In other words, a function f is in L^p(I) if the integral of |f|^p over I is finite. 

In this case, the interval is (0,1), and the function is log x. Since log x is negative on (0,1), we can write |log x| = -log x. So, we need to check for which p > 0 the integral of (-log x)^p from 0 to 1 is finite. 

Let me write that down: ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. I need to evaluate this integral and see for which p it converges. 

To handle the integral, maybe substitution will help. Let's try substituting t = -log x. Let's see, if t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, and dx = -e^{-t} dt. When x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So changing the limits of integration accordingly:

∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{∞}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt.

Wait, that integral is the Gamma function Γ(p+1). The Gamma function is defined as Γ(z) = ∫₀^∞ t^{z-1} e^{-t} dt. So here, z = p + 1. Therefore, the integral becomes Γ(p+1). 

Now, I remember that the Gamma function Γ(z) converges for Re(z) > 0. Since p > 0, then p + 1 > 1, which is greater than 0. Therefore, Γ(p+1) is finite for all p > 0. 

Wait, so does that mean that for all p > 0, the integral ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx is finite? But that seems counterintuitive because log x behaves badly near 0. Let me double-check my substitution. 

Original substitution: t = -log x. Then when x approaches 0, t approaches +infinity. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt. Yes, that's the Gamma function. And the Gamma function is indeed convergent for all p > -1. But since p > 0 in our case, p + 1 > 1, so the integral converges. 

But wait, let me check with specific values. For example, take p = 1. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ -log x dx. Integrating by parts, let u = -log x, dv = dx. Then du = -1/x dx, v = x. So uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [-x log x]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ -1 dx. The first term: at x = 1, it's 0; at x = 0, the limit as x approaches 0 of -x log x is 0 (since x log x approaches 0). So the first term is 0 - 0 = 0. The second term is ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1. Therefore, the integral is 1, which is finite. 

For p = 2, the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx. Let's compute that. Again, substitution t = -log x gives ∫₀^∞ t^2 e^{-t} dt = Γ(3) = 2! = 2. Which is finite. 

For p = 0.5, the integral would be Γ(1.5) = (sqrt(π)/2) ≈ 0.886. Also finite. 

Wait, so even for p approaching 0, say p = 0.1, the integral becomes Γ(1.1), which is finite. So according to this, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But that seems strange because near x = 0, log x approaches -infty. So |log x|^p near 0 would be (something like |t|^p) where t approaches infinity. But in the substitution, we transformed it into an integral over t from 0 to infinity of t^p e^{-t} dt, which is the Gamma function. 

But the Gamma function converges for Re(z) > 0, so for p > -1. But our p is greater than 0, so all p > 0 are allowed. Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But wait, let me check another approach. Suppose we consider the integral near 0. Let’s make a substitution to analyze the behavior as x approaches 0. Let’s set x = e^{-y}, so as x approaches 0, y approaches infinity. Then dx = -e^{-y} dy. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^1 (-log x)^p dx = ∫₀^∞ y^p e^{-y} dy, which is the same Gamma function. So yes, the integral converges for all p > -1, so for p > 0, it's convergent. 

Alternatively, suppose we didn't use substitution. Let's consider the behavior of |log x|^p near 0. Let’s set x approaching 0+, so log x approaches -infty. Let’s make a substitution t = -log x, so t approaches +infty as x approaches 0. Then x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which is the Gamma function. So again, same result. 

Therefore, unless there is a mistake in my reasoning, the answer should be all p > 0. But let me verify with another method. Let's consider the integral ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx. Let’s split the integral into two parts: from 0 to some ε and from ε to 1. The integral from ε to 1 is finite because |log x|^p is continuous on [ε,1] for ε > 0. So the problem is near 0. Let’s analyze the integral near 0. 

As x approaches 0, log x ≈ - (1/x - 1/2x^2 + ... ) but maybe that's too detailed. Alternatively, for x near 0, log x ~ - (1/x). Wait, no, log x approaches -infty, but the rate is logarithmic. Wait, actually, as x approaches 0+, log x behaves like - (1/x) in terms of growth, but actually, it's logarithmic. Wait, no. Wait, x approaches 0+, log x approaches -infty, but how does it grow? For example, x = e^{-y}, so log x = -y, so as x approaches 0, y approaches infinity, and y = - log x. So |log x|^p = y^p. Then dx = -e^{-y} dy, so the integral near 0 is ∫₀^∞ y^p e^{-y} dy, which is Gamma(p+1). 

So, regardless of the approach, the integral is the Gamma function, which is convergent for all p > -1. Therefore, since p > 0 is given, the integral is finite for all p > 0. 

Wait, but let me check with a concrete example. Let's take p = 1/2. Then |log x|^{1/2} is sqrt(-log x). Let's see if ∫₀¹ sqrt(-log x) dx converges. Let me compute that. Let’s use substitution t = sqrt(-log x). Let’s see, t = sqrt(-log x) => t^2 = -log x => log x = -t^2 => x = e^{-t^2}. Then dx = -2 t e^{-t^2} dt. So when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x =1, t=0. So the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t * (-2 t e^{-t^2} dt) = ∫₀^∞ -2 t^2 e^{-t^2} dt. Wait, but the original integral is ∫₀¹ sqrt(-log x) dx = ∫₀^∞ t * 2 t e^{-t^2} dt = ∫₀^∞ 2 t^2 e^{-t^2} dt. Which is 2 * (1/2) Γ(3/2) = Γ(3/2) = (sqrt(π)/2) ≈ 0.886. So it converges. 

Alternatively, if p = 2, we saw earlier that the integral is 2. So all p > 0 work. 

But let me check if I made a mistake in the substitution. Suppose I didn't use substitution and tried to compute the integral directly. For example, take p = 1: ∫₀¹ -log x dx. We did integration by parts earlier and got 1. For p = 2: ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx. Let's compute that. Let’s integrate by parts. Let u = (-log x)^2, dv = dx. Then du = 2 (-log x) * (-1/x) dx = 2 (log x)/x dx, v = x. Then uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [x (-log x)^2]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ 2 (log x) dx. The first term: at x=1, it's 0; at x=0, the limit is 0 (since x (log x)^2 approaches 0). Then the integral becomes -2 ∫₀¹ log x dx = -2*(-1) = 2. Which matches the Gamma function result. 

Therefore, the substitution approach seems consistent. 

Therefore, unless there is a mistake in my reasoning, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

Wait, but let me check for p approaching 0. For p approaching 0, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx. Let's see, as p approaches 0, |log x|^p approaches 1 for x not 1, since any number to the power 0 is 1, except at x=1 where log x = 0. So the integral approaches ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1. So even as p approaches 0, the integral remains finite. Therefore, the integral is finite for all p > 0. 

Therefore, the answer should be all p > 0. 

But wait, let me check another source or example. Suppose I take p = -1. Then the integral would be ∫₀¹ |log x|^{-1} dx = ∫₀¹ 1/|log x| dx. Let’s analyze that. Let’s make substitution t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ 1/t * e^{-t} dt. But ∫₀^∞ e^{-t}/t dt is divergent because near t=0, 1/t e^{-t} ~ 1/t, which is not integrable. So for p = -1, the integral diverges. But our p is greater than 0, so no problem. 

Therefore, the critical point is at p = -1. For p > -1, the integral converges. Since we are considering p > 0, which is a subset of p > -1, all such p are allowed. 

Therefore, the answer is all p > 0. So the values of p are all positive real numbers. 

Wait, but let me check if there's a possible mistake in substitution steps. For example, when I set t = -log x, is that substitution valid? Let's confirm. The function log x is defined on (0,1), and it's a smooth function except at x=0. The substitution t = -log x is a one-to-one transformation from (0,1) to (0, ∞), which is valid. The Jacobian of the substitution is dx = -e^{-t} dt, so the absolute value becomes e^{-t} dt. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which is the Gamma function. 

Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation here, the conclusion is correct. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use Hölder's inequality or some other inequality, but in this case, substitution seems straightforward. 

Therefore, I think the answer is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

**Final Answer**
The function \\( \\log x \\) belongs to \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). Thus, the solution is \\boxed{(0, \\infty)}.

","Okay, let's see. The problem is to determine all values of p > 0 such that log x is in L^p((0,1)). Hmm, L^p spaces are about functions whose p-th power is Lebesgue integrable over the given interval. So, basically, we need to check for which p the integral of |log x|^p from 0 to 1 is finite. 

First, I remember that log x is negative on the interval (0,1). So, |log x| is just -log x there. Therefore, the integral we need to consider is ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let me write that down properly: ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. So, the question reduces to finding all p > 0 where this integral converges.

Now, how do I evaluate this integral? Maybe a substitution would help. Let's let t = -log x. Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches +∞, and when x = 1, t = 0. Let's try changing variables. 

If t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, and dx = -e^{-t} dt. So, substituting into the integral, we get:

∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{∞}^{0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^{∞} t^p e^{-t} dt.

Wait, that's the Gamma function! The Gamma function Γ(p+1) is equal to ∫₀^{∞} t^p e^{-t} dt, which converges for p > -1. But in our case, p is given as greater than 0, so p > 0. So, according to this substitution, the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx is equal to Γ(p+1), which is finite for all p > 0. Wait, but hold on. The Gamma function Γ(z) is defined for Re(z) > 0, so z = p + 1, so Re(z) = p + 1. Since p > 0, then p + 1 > 1 > 0, so Γ(p+1) is finite for all p > 0. Therefore, does that mean that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0?

But wait, that seems counterintuitive. Because as p increases, the function |log x|^p becomes more singular near 0. Wait, but maybe the integral still converges? Let me check with specific examples. For p = 1, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ -log x dx. Let's compute that. The integral of -log x dx is x - x log x evaluated from 0 to 1. At x = 1, it's 1 - 1*0 = 1. At x = 0, the limit as x approaches 0 of x - x log x. The term x log x approaches 0 (since x approaches 0 faster than log x approaches -infty), so the lower limit is 0. Therefore, the integral is 1. So, that's finite. 

For p = 2, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx. Let's compute that. Again, substitution t = -log x. Then, x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. So, the integral becomes ∫₀^{∞} t^2 e^{-t} dt = Γ(3) = 2! = 2. So, that's finite as well. Similarly, for p = 3, it would be Γ(4) = 6, which is finite. So, in general, Γ(p+1) is finite for all p > 0. Therefore, does that mean log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0? That seems to be the case according to this substitution.

But wait, let me verify with another approach. Maybe directly evaluating the integral without substitution. Let's consider ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let's make a substitution like y = log x. Then, x = e^y, dx = e^y dy. When x approaches 0, y approaches -infty, and when x = 1, y = 0. So, the integral becomes ∫_{-∞}^0 (-y)^p e^y dy = ∫_{-∞}^0 |y|^p e^y dy. Let's substitute z = -y, so z goes from +infty to 0, and dy = -dz. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{∞}^0 z^p e^{-z} (-dz) = ∫₀^{∞} z^p e^{-z} dz = Γ(p+1). So, same result. So, regardless of substitution, we end up with the Gamma function, which converges for p > -1. Since p > 0, all such p are allowed. 

But wait, the original question is for p > 0. So, according to this, all p > 0 are acceptable. But that seems strange because as p increases, the function becomes more singular. But according to the Gamma function, the integral is always finite for p > -1, so even for p approaching infinity, the integral is finite? Wait, but the Gamma function does converge for all p > -1, but as p increases, the value of Γ(p+1) increases as well. However, convergence in L^p doesn't depend on the actual value of the integral, just on its finiteness. So, even though the integral grows with p, it's still finite for any fixed p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But wait, let me check with some references or similar problems. For example, consider f(x) = log x on (0,1). The question is about its L^p integrability. The substitution method seems to show that the integral is equal to Γ(p+1), which is finite for p > -1. Therefore, even though p > 0, but since p is in the exponent, even for p approaching 0, the integral is finite. Wait, but as p approaches 0, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^0 dx = ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1, which is finite. So, even for p approaching 0 from the right, the integral is finite. Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, another thought: Maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me double-check. If we set t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then, when x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from +infty to 0. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{+infty}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^{+infty} t^p e^{-t} dt. Yes, that's correct. So, the substitution leads to the Gamma function, which is finite for p > -1. Therefore, even for p = 0.5, for example, the integral is finite. So, the answer should be all p > 0.

But wait, hold on. Let me check for p approaching 0. As p approaches 0, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^0 dx = ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1, which is finite. For p approaching infinity, the integral would be ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. But even as p grows, the integral is Γ(p+1), which does grow, but it's still finite for any fixed p. So, even though the function becomes more singular as p increases, the integral remains finite. Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

Therefore, the answer should be all positive real numbers p. But let me check another source or example. Suppose I take p = 1/2. Then, the integral is ∫₀¹ sqrt(-log x) dx. Let's compute that. Using substitution t = -log x, we get ∫₀^{infty} sqrt(t) e^{-t} dt = Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π, which is finite. Similarly, p = 1/3: Γ(4/3) is finite. So, yes, even for fractional p, the integral is finite. Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

Wait, but another perspective: Let's analyze the behavior near 0 and 1. Near x = 1, log x behaves like x - 1, so it's integrable in any L^p. The problem is near x = 0. So, near 0, log x ~ -log x, so we have to check the integral of (-log x)^p near 0. Let's substitute x = e^{-t}, so t = -log x, and as x approaches 0, t approaches infinity. Then, dx = -e^{-t} dt, so the integral near 0 becomes ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^{∞} t^p e^{-t} dt, which is the Gamma function again. So, regardless of the behavior near 0, the integral converges. Therefore, the answer is all p > 0.

Therefore, the final answer is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

**Final Answer**
The function \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). Thus, the solution is \\boxed{(0, \\infty)}.

","Okay, let's see. I need to find all values of p > 0 such that log x is in L^p on the interval (0,1). Hmm, L^p spaces are about the integrability of functions raised to the power p. So, for log x to be in L^p((0,1)), the integral of |log x|^p over (0,1) must be finite. Since log x is negative on (0,1), taking absolute value would make it positive, so we can consider the integral of (-log x)^p dx from 0 to 1. 

Wait, actually, log x is negative on (0,1) because x is between 0 and 1, and log of numbers less than 1 is negative. So, |log x| = -log x. Therefore, the integral we need to check is ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. If this integral converges, then log x is in L^p((0,1)).

So, the problem reduces to determining for which p > 0 the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx is finite. Let me try to compute this integral or at least analyze its convergence.

First, let's make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let t = -log x. Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So, we can change the variable. Let's compute the substitution:

If t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, and dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, when x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from ∞ to 0. So, the integral becomes:

∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{t=∞}^{t=0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt.

Wait, that's the Gamma function! The integral ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt is equal to Γ(p + 1). But wait, the Gamma function Γ(z) is defined for Re(z) > 0, so here p + 1 must be greater than 0. But since p > 0, p + 1 is always greater than 1, right? Wait, no. Wait, if p > 0, then p + 1 > 1, so Re(z) > 0 is satisfied. Therefore, the integral converges for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The substitution seems correct. Let me verify the steps again.

Original integral: ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx.

Let t = -log x ⇒ x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt.

When x = 0, t = ∞; x = 1, t = 0. So, reversing the limits:

∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{∞}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt = Γ(p + 1).

Yes, that's correct. And the Gamma function Γ(z) converges for all complex z with Re(z) > 0. Since p is a real number greater than 0, Re(z) = p + 1 > 1 > 0, so the integral converges. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, intuitively, log x behaves like log x near x=1, but near x=0, log x approaches -infinity. However, the integral ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx converges for any p > 0? That seems counterintuitive because even though near x=0, log x is going to -infinity, but the substitution shows that the integral becomes the Gamma function, which is finite for all p > 0. So, maybe it's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me try another approach. Let's split the integral into two parts: near 0 and near 1. For example, let's consider integrating from 0 to 1/2 and from 1/2 to 1.

But near x=1, log x is approximately 0, so (-log x)^p is negligible. The main contribution to the integral comes from near x=0. So, near x=0, log x ≈ log x, so we can approximate the integral near 0. Let's make substitution x = e^{-t}, then as x approaches 0, t approaches infinity. So, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then, the integral near x=0 becomes ∫_{t=∞}^{t=log 1} (-log x)^p dx = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which is the same as before. So, regardless of splitting the integral, the convergence near x=0 depends on the Gamma function integral, which converges for all p > 0. Therefore, the conclusion holds.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the integral for some specific p to check. For example, take p=1. Then, ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx. Let's compute that. Let u = -log x, then du = -1/x dx, so x = e^{-u}, dx = -e^{-u} du. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ u e^{-u} du = Γ(2) = 1! = 1. So, converges. For p=2, ∫₀¹ (log x)^2 dx. Similarly, substitution gives Γ(3) = 2! = 2. Also converges. For p approaching 0, say p=0.5, then Γ(0.5 + 1) = Γ(1.5) = (1/2)√π, which is finite. So, even for p approaching 0, the integral converges. Therefore, it seems that for all p > 0, the integral converges. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, the problem says ""Determine all values of p > 0 such that log x ∈ L^p((0,1))"". According to the above, all p > 0. But maybe the user made a typo? Wait, the original problem is ""Determine all values of p > 0 such that log x ∈ L^p((0,1))"". The user wrote ""Return your fina Determine all values of p > 0 such that log x ∈ L^p((0,1)).\\frac{2}{3}$"". Maybe there was a typo, but the main question is as stated. So, according to the analysis, the answer should be all p > 0. But maybe I need to check again.

Alternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in the substitution. Let me compute the integral directly for some p. Let's take p=1. Then, ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx. Let's compute it without substitution. Let u = log x. Then, du = 1/x dx. Hmm, maybe integrating by parts. Let me set u = -log x, dv = dx. Then, du = -1/x dx, v = x. Then, ∫ u dv = uv - ∫ v du = (-log x)x - ∫ x*(-1/x) dx = -x log x + ∫ 1 dx. Evaluated from 0 to 1. At x=1: -0 + 1. At x=0: lim_{x→0+} (-x log x + x). The term x log x approaches 0 (since x approaches 0 and log x approaches -infty, but x log x approaches 0 by L’Hospital), and x approaches 0. So, the integral is 1 - 0 = 1. Which matches the Gamma function result. So, correct.

Similarly, for p=2, ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx. Let's compute that. Using substitution x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt, integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^2 e^{-t} dt = Γ(3) = 2! = 2. So, converges. For p=3, Γ(4)=6, etc. For p approaching 0, Γ(1 + p) approaches Γ(1) = 1. So, even for p=0.1, the integral converges. Therefore, the conclusion is that for all p > 0, log x is in L^p((0,1)).

Therefore, the answer should be all p > 0. But maybe the user had a typo and the original problem was different, but based on the given question, this is the correct conclusion.

Wait, but the user included a fraction 2/3 at the end. Maybe there was a specific value? But the problem as stated is to determine all p>0. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the user is confused, but according to my analysis, it's all p>0. Therefore, unless there is an error in my reasoning, the answer is all positive p.

But let me check another source or think again. For example, in general, functions that are in L^p for all p > 0 are called ""strongly integrable"" or something similar. But in this case, log x is not integrable in the sense that its integral over (0,1) doesn't exist (since ∫₀¹ log x dx = -1, but here we are talking about the absolute value). Wait, but ∫₀¹ |log x| dx = 1, which is finite, but here we are taking |log x|^p. So, even for p=1, it's finite, and for higher p, it's also finite. For p approaching 0, even though |log x|^p approaches 1, the integral remains finite. So, indeed, for all p > 0, the integral converges. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

Therefore, the answer is all p > 0. So, the values of p are all positive real numbers.

**Final Answer**
The function \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). Therefore, the solution is \\boxed{(0, \\infty)}.

To determine all values of \\( p > 0 \\) such that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\), we need to check if the integral \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx \\) converges. Since \\( \\log x \\) is negative on \\( (0,1) \\), we consider the integral \\( \\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^p dx \\).

We perform a substitution to analyze the integral. Let \\( t = -\\log x \\), which transforms the integral as follows:
- When \\( x \\) approaches 0, \\( t \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\).
- When \\( x = 1 \\), \\( t = 0 \\).
- The substitution gives \\( x = e^{-t} \\) and \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\).

Changing the limits of integration accordingly, we get:
\\[
\\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^p dx = \\int_{+\\infty}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = \\int_0^{+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt
\\]

This integral is recognized as the Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\), which converges for all \\( p > -1 \\). Since we are given \\( p > 0 \\), the integral \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\) is finite for all \\( p > 0 \\).

Thus, the function \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out all values of p > 0 such that log x is in L^p on the interval (0,1). Hmm, L^p spaces... Right, a function is in L^p if the integral of its absolute value raised to the power p is finite. So, in this case, we need to check when ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx is finite. 

First, let me recall what the logarithm function looks like on (0,1). The natural logarithm log x is negative for x in (0,1), right? Because log 1 is 0, and as x approaches 0 from the right, log x goes to negative infinity. So, |log x| would be -log x in this interval. Therefore, the integral we need to evaluate is ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. 

Since p is positive, we can write this as ∫₀¹ ( -log x )^p dx. Let me make a substitution to evaluate this integral. Let me set t = -log x. Then, x = e^{-t}. When x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So, the limits of integration will change from x ∈ (0,1) to t ∈ (∞, 0). Let's compute dx in terms of dt. 

If t = -log x, then dt/dx = -1/x. Therefore, dx = -x dt. But x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. However, since we are changing the limits from x=0 to x=1, which becomes t=∞ to t=0, the negative sign will reverse the limits. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ ( -log x )^p dx = ∫₀^{∞} t^p e^{-t} dt. Wait, that's the Gamma function! Γ(p+1) = ∫₀^{∞} t^p e^{-t} dt. 

But the Gamma function Γ(p+1) is known to converge when p + 1 > 0, which is p > -1. However, in our case, p is given as greater than 0. Therefore, since p > 0, p + 1 > 1, so Γ(p+1) is finite for all p > 0. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx = Γ(p+1), which is finite for all p > 0. 

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify this substitution again. Let me check the substitution steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Original integral: ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let t = -log x. Then x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. When x=0, t=∞; x=1, t=0. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{t=∞}^{0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^{∞} t^p e^{-t} dt. Yes, that's correct. So the integral is indeed the Gamma function Γ(p+1). 

But the Gamma function Γ(z) is defined for all complex numbers z except non-positive integers, and for real numbers z > 0, Γ(z) is positive and converges. However, for z ≤ 0, Γ(z) has poles. But in our case, z = p + 1, and p > 0, so z = p + 1 > 1. Therefore, Γ(p + 1) is finite for all p > 0. 

Therefore, does that mean that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0? That seems counterintuitive because log x tends to negative infinity as x approaches 0, but maybe since we are taking the absolute value and raising it to the power p, the integral still converges. 

Wait, let me test this with specific values. For example, if p = 1, then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx. Let's compute that. Let u = -log x, dv = dx. Then du = -1/x dx, v = x. Integration by parts: uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [ -x log x ]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ (-1) dx. The first term evaluates to [0 - 0] because at x=1, x log x is 0, and as x approaches 0, x log x approaches 0 (since x approaches 0 and log x approaches -infty, but x approaches 0 faster). Then the integral becomes 0 + ∫₀¹ dx = 1. So the integral is 1, which is finite. 

For p = 2, the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx. Let's see. Using the same substitution t = -log x, we get ∫₀^{∞} t^2 e^{-t} dt = Γ(3) = 2! = 2. So that's finite. 

Wait, but if p approaches 0, then Γ(p + 1) approaches Γ(1) = 1. So even when p is very small, like p = 0.1, the integral is still finite. So, is it that for any p > 0, the integral is finite? Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0? 

But I recall that sometimes functions that go to infinity can only be in L^p spaces for certain p. For example, functions like 1/x^a near 0 are in L^p if a < 1/p. But here, log x behaves differently. 

Wait, perhaps the key difference is that log x approaches negative infinity, but the rate at which it approaches is slower than any power function. For example, near x=0, log x ≈ -log(ε) where ε approaches 0. If we compare to, say, x^{-1/2}, which is a function that blows up at 0 but is in L^p for p < 2. However, log x is not a power function; it's a logarithm, which is integrable with any exponent p > 0. 

Therefore, according to the substitution and Gamma function result, the integral ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx = Γ(p+1) < ∞ for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But let me check another source or example. Suppose p = 1/2. Then the integral is ∫₀¹ sqrt(-log x) dx. Using substitution t = -log x, we get ∫₀^{∞} t^{1/2} e^{-t} dt = Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π, which is finite. Similarly, for p = 1/3, it's Γ(4/3) which is also finite. So this seems consistent. 

Alternatively, if we didn't use the Gamma function substitution, could we compute the integral more directly? Let's try integrating (-log x)^p dx from 0 to 1. Let me make a substitution here as well. Let u = log x, then du = 1/x dx. But that might not help. Alternatively, let's set t = log x, so when x approaches 0, t approaches -infty, and when x=1, t=0. Then x = e^t, dx = e^t dt. So the integral becomes ∫_{-infty}^0 (-t)^p e^t dt = ∫_{-infty}^0 (-t)^p e^t dt. Let me substitute s = -t, so s goes from 0 to infinity. Then the integral becomes ∫₀^{∞} s^p e^{-s} ds = Γ(p + 1). 

Same result. So this confirms the substitution again. Therefore, the integral is indeed equal to Γ(p + 1), which converges for all p > -1. Since p > 0, it's definitely finite. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But wait, let me just check for p = 0. But the problem states p > 0, so p = 0 is not considered. 

Alternatively, suppose someone claims that near x=0, log x behaves like -log(1 - (1 - x)) ≈ - (x + x^2/2 + ...), but actually, as x approaches 0, log x ≈ -log(1/x) ≈ -log(1/x) which is -log(1/x) = log(1/x^{-1}) = log(1/x). Wait, no, the expansion near x=0 is not straightforward. Maybe it's better to stick with the substitution. 

Alternatively, let's approximate the integral near x=0. Let's split the integral into two parts: from 0 to 1/2 and from 1/2 to 1. The integral from 1/2 to 1 is finite because log x is continuous there. So the problematic part is near x=0. Let's focus on ∫₀^{1/2} (-log x)^p dx. Let me make substitution x = e^{-y}, so y = -log x. Then when x approaches 0, y approaches infinity, and x=1/2 corresponds to y = log 2. So the integral becomes ∫_{log 2}^{∞} y^p e^{-y} dy. This is ∫_{log 2}^{∞} y^p e^{-y} dy. Since y^p e^{-y} decays exponentially as y approaches infinity, the integral converges for any p > 0. Therefore, even near x=0, the integral converges. 

Therefore, combining both parts, the entire integral converges for all p > 0. 

Hence, the answer is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

**Final Answer**
The function \\( \\log x \\) belongs to \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). Therefore, the solution is \\boxed{(0, \\infty)}.

Thus, the function \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

","Okay, so I need to determine all values of \\( p > 0 \\) such that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\). Hmm, let me start by recalling what \\( L^p \\) spaces are. The space \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) consists of all measurable functions \\( f \\) on the interval \\( (0,1) \\) for which the \\( p \\)-th power of the absolute value of \\( f \\) is Lebesgue integrable. In other words, \\( \\int_0^1 |f(x)|^p dx < \\infty \\).

So, in this case, the function in question is \\( \\log x \\). Since \\( x \\) is in \\( (0,1) \\), \\( \\log x \\) is negative. But since we take the absolute value, \\( |\\log x| \\) will be positive. Therefore, the integral we need to check is \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx \\). And we need to find all \\( p > 0 \\) for which this integral is finite.

First, let's note that \\( \\log x \\) approaches \\( -\\infty \\) as \\( x \\) approaches 0, and it is equal to 0 when \\( x = 1 \\). So the function \\( |\\log x| \\) behaves like \\( -\\log x \\) near 0, which grows without bound, and it's 0 at 1. Therefore, the integral's convergence depends on the behavior near 0 and near 1. However, near 1, \\( \\log x \\) is approaching 0, so \\( |\\log x| \\) is approaching 0, which is fine. The potential problem is near 0, where \\( |\\log x| \\) becomes very large. So the integral may diverge there, depending on \\( p \\).

To check the convergence, we can analyze the integral near 0. Let's make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let \\( t = -\\log x \\). Then, as \\( x \\) approaches 0, \\( t \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\), and when \\( x = 1 \\), \\( t = 0 \\). Let's compute the substitution:

If \\( t = -\\log x \\), then \\( x = e^{-t} \\), and \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx = \\int_{+\\infty}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = \\int_0^{+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt
\\]

Wait, hold on. That substitution seems a bit confusing. Let's check again. If \\( x \\) goes from 0 to 1, then \\( t = -\\log x \\) goes from \\( +\\infty \\) to 0. Therefore, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_0^1 t^p e^{-t} dt
\\]

But with \\( t \\) going from \\( +\\infty \\) to 0, so we can reverse the limits:

\\[
\\int_0^{+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt
\\]

Yes, that's correct. So the integral becomes \\( \\int_0^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\). Wait a second, that's the Gamma function! The Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\) is defined as \\( \\int_0^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\), which converges for all \\( p > -1 \\). But in our case, \\( p > 0 \\), so the Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\) is well-defined for \\( p > 0 \\). Therefore, the integral \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx = \\Gamma(p+1) \\), which is finite for all \\( p > 0 \\).

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Did I make a mistake in substitution?

Let me verify again. Starting with the substitution:

Let \\( t = -\\log x \\). Then, \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\).

When \\( x \\in (0,1) \\), \\( t \\in (0, \\infty) \\).

Therefore, the integral:

\\[
\\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx = \\int_{t=+\\infty}^{t=0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = \\int_{t=0}^{t=+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt
\\]

Yes, that's correct. So indeed, the integral becomes the Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\), which is equal to \\( p! \\) when \\( p \\) is a positive integer. But for real numbers \\( p > 0 \\), the Gamma function is defined and converges. Therefore, the integral \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx \\) is finite for all \\( p > 0 \\).

But wait, that contradicts my initial intuition. If \\( |\\log x| \\) behaves like \\( 1/x \\) near 0, but actually, \\( \\log x \\) approaches \\( -\\infty \\), so \\( |\\log x| \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\). But how does it compare to \\( 1/x \\)?

Wait, maybe I need to check the behavior near 0. Let's consider the integral near 0. Let's split the integral at some small \\( \\epsilon > 0 \\):

\\[
\\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx = \\int_0^{\\epsilon} |\\log x|^p dx + \\int_{\\epsilon}^1 |\\log x|^p dx
\\]

The second integral \\( \\int_{\\epsilon}^1 |\\log x|^p dx \\) is clearly finite because \\( \\log x \\) is continuous on \\( [\\epsilon, 1] \\), hence bounded, so \\( |\\log x|^p \\) is bounded there, and the interval is of finite length. So the problem is with the first integral \\( \\int_0^{\\epsilon} |\\log x|^p dx \\).

So let's analyze \\( \\int_0^{\\epsilon} |\\log x|^p dx \\). Let me make substitution \\( t = -\\log x \\), so \\( dt = -\\frac{1}{x} dx \\), which implies \\( dx = -x dt \\). But since \\( x = e^{-t} \\), then \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{t=+\\infty}^{t=-\\log \\epsilon} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = \\int_{t=-\\log \\epsilon}^{t=+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt
\\]

But as \\( \\epsilon \\) approaches 0, \\( -\\log \\epsilon \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{+\\infty}^{+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt
\\]

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, perhaps I need to be more careful. Let me re-express the integral:

Original integral: \\( \\int_0^{\\epsilon} |\\log x|^p dx \\).

Substitute \\( t = -\\log x \\), so \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\).

When \\( x = 0 \\), \\( t \\to +\\infty \\), and when \\( x = \\epsilon \\), \\( t = -\\log \\epsilon \\).

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{t=+\\infty}^{t=-\\log \\epsilon} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = \\int_{t=-\\log \\epsilon}^{t=+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt
\\]

So as \\( \\epsilon \\to 0 \\), \\( -\\log \\epsilon \\to +\\infty \\), so the integral becomes:

\\[
\\lim_{A \\to +\\infty} \\int_{A}^{+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt
\\]

Which is the tail of the Gamma function. But the Gamma function integral from 0 to infinity is convergent for \\( p > -1 \\). However, the tail integral \\( \\int_{A}^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\) tends to zero as \\( A \\to \\infty \\), right? Because the exponential decay dominates the polynomial growth. Therefore, the tail integral is finite for any \\( A \\), but as \\( A \\) increases, the integral decreases and tends to zero. Wait, but in our case, when we take the limit as \\( \\epsilon \\to 0 \\), \\( A = -\\log \\epsilon \\to +\\infty \\), so the integral becomes:

\\[
\\int_{+\\infty}^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt = 0
\\]

Wait, that can't be. There must be a miscalculation here.

Wait, no. Let's think again. If we have:

\\( \\int_{t=-\\log \\epsilon}^{t=+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\)

But as \\( \\epsilon \\to 0 \\), \\( -\\log \\epsilon \\to +\\infty \\), so the integral becomes:

\\( \\lim_{A \\to +\\infty} \\int_{A}^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\)

Which is the same as the tail of the Gamma function starting at \\( A \\). For the Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p+1) = \\int_0^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\), the tail \\( \\int_{A}^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\) tends to zero as \\( A \\to \\infty \\). Therefore, the integral \\( \\int_{A}^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\) is finite for any \\( A \\), but as \\( A \\to \\infty \\), the integral tends to zero. Therefore, in our case, when \\( \\epsilon \\to 0 \\), the integral \\( \\int_0^{\\epsilon} |\\log x|^p dx \\) becomes \\( \\int_{A}^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\) where \\( A \\to \\infty \\), which tends to zero. Therefore, the first integral is zero in the limit? That can't be.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me try another approach. Let's consider the substitution \\( t = -\\log x \\), so \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\). Therefore, the integral \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx \\) becomes \\( \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\), which is the Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\). Therefore, the integral is equal to \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\), which converges for all \\( p > -1 \\). Therefore, for all \\( p > 0 \\), the integral is finite, so \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

But this contradicts my initial thought that maybe the integral diverges for some \\( p \\). So where is the mistake here?

Wait, perhaps the substitution is correct. Let's check with specific values. For example, take \\( p = 1 \\). Then \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x| dx \\). Let's compute this integral directly. Let \\( u = \\log x \\), then \\( du = \\frac{1}{x} dx \\), so \\( dx = x du = e^u du \\). The integral becomes \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^0 |u| e^u du = \\int_{-\\infty}^0 -u e^u du \\). Let \\( v = u \\), \\( dv = du \\), \\( dw = e^u du \\), \\( w = e^u \\). Integration by parts: \\( -u e^u |_{-\\infty}^0 + \\int_{-\\infty}^0 e^u du = -0 + \\int_{-\\infty}^0 e^u du = -1 \\). Wait, that can't be. Wait, the integral \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^0 -u e^u du \\) is equal to \\( \\int_{-\\infty}^0 -u e^u du \\). Let me compute it again.

Alternatively, substitute \\( t = -\\log x \\), so \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\), so the integral becomes \\( \\int_{t=+\\infty}^{t=0} t e^{-t} (-dt) = \\int_{0}^{\\infty} t e^{-t} dt = \\Gamma(2) = 1! = 1 \\). So the integral is 1. So for \\( p = 1 \\), the integral is 1, which is finite. Similarly, for \\( p = 2 \\), it would be \\( \\Gamma(3) = 2! = 2 \\). So indeed, the integral is finite for all \\( p > 0 \\).

But wait, earlier when I thought about the behavior near 0, I considered \\( |\\log x| \\) as growing like \\( 1/x \\), but that's not correct. Actually, \\( \\log x \\) as \\( x \\to 0 \\) behaves like \\( -\\log x \\), which grows to infinity, but it's not a power function. So the growth is logarithmic, not polynomial. Therefore, the integral \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx \\) is actually convergent for all \\( p > 0 \\), because the Gamma function is defined for \\( p > -1 \\), which includes all positive \\( p \\).

Therefore, the conclusion is that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

Wait, but let me check another reference or recall some standard integrals. For example, the integral \\( \\int_0^1 (\\log x)^p dx \\) is known. Let me compute it for a specific \\( p \\). Let's take \\( p = 1 \\). As we saw, it's 1. For \\( p = 2 \\), it's 2. For \\( p = n \\), it's \\( n! \\). Wait, but \\( \\log x \\) is negative, so \\( (\\log x)^p \\) is negative when \\( p \\) is odd, but since we take absolute value, it's positive. However, since we are dealing with \\( L^p \\), the absolute value is already considered. Therefore, even for \\( p \\) not integer, the integral converges.

Therefore, the substitution shows that the integral is equal to \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\), which is finite for \\( p > -1 \\). Since we are considering \\( p > 0 \\), it's always finite. Therefore, the answer should be that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

But wait, this seems counterintuitive. For example, if we have a function that behaves like \\( 1/\\sqrt{x} \\) near 0, which is in \\( L^p \\) for \\( p < 2 \\), but if we have a function that behaves like \\( 1/x \\), which is not in \\( L^p \\) for any \\( p \\). However, \\( \\log x \\) behaves differently; it's not like \\( 1/x \\), but rather logarithmic growth. So even though it goes to infinity, the integral converges for any \\( p > 0 \\). Therefore, the answer is all \\( p > 0 \\).

But let me verify once more. Let's take \\( p = 0.5 \\). Then the integral would be \\( \\Gamma(0.5 + 1) = \\Gamma(1.5) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{\\pi} \\approx 0.886 \\), which is finite. Similarly, for \\( p = 10 \\), the integral would be \\( \\Gamma(11) = 10! \\approx 3.6288 \\times 10^6 \\), which is also finite. Therefore, regardless of \\( p > 0 \\), the integral converges. Therefore, the conclusion is that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

To determine all values of \\( p > 0 \\) such that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\), we need to check if the integral \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx \\) converges. Since \\( \\log x \\) is negative on \\( (0,1) \\), we consider the integral \\( \\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^p dx \\).

We perform a substitution to analyze the integral. Let \\( t = -\\log x \\), which transforms the integral as follows:
- When \\( x \\) approaches 0, \\( t \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\).
- When \\( x = 1 \\), \\( t = 0 \\).
- The substitution gives \\( x = e^{-t} \\) and \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\).

Changing the limits of integration accordingly, we get:
\\[
\\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^p dx = \\int_{+\\infty}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = \\int_0^{+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt

This integral is recognized as the Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\), which converges for all \\( p > -1 \\). Since we are given \\( p > 0 \\), the integral \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\) is finite for all \\( p > 0 \\).

Thus, the function \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out all the values of p > 0 for which the logarithm function log x is in the L^p space on the interval (0,1). Hmm, L^p spaces are about the integrability of functions, right? So, basically, I need to check whether the integral of |log x|^p over (0,1) converges. 

First, let me recall what L^p spaces are. For a function f on a measure space, it's in L^p if the integral of |f|^p is finite. In this case, our measure space is (0,1) with the Lebesgue measure, and f(x) = log x. Since log x is negative on (0,1), but we take the absolute value, |log x| = -log x because x is between 0 and 1, so log x is negative. So, the integral we need to consider is ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. 

Wait, but I need to be careful here. Let me confirm: log x is indeed negative on (0,1), so |log x| = -log x. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Now, the question is for which p > 0 this integral is finite. 

To evaluate this integral, maybe I can make a substitution. Let me try substituting t = -log x. Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So, the limits of integration will change from x=0 to x=1 into t=∞ to t=0. Let's compute the substitution properly. 

If t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, and dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, when x approaches 0, t approaches ∞, and when x = 1, t = 0. So, flipping the limits, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫₀^∞ t^p * e^{-t} dt. Wait, that's interesting. Because dx = -e^{-t} dt, so the negative sign flips the limits, making it ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt. 

But hold on, the integral ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt is the Gamma function, Γ(p + 1). And the Gamma function is finite for p + 1 > 0, which means p > -1. However, in our case, p > 0, so this would suggest that the integral converges for all p > 0. But wait, that seems conflicting with my initial intuition. Because log x near 0 behaves like -log x, which goes to infinity as x approaches 0. So, maybe the integral converges even though the function is unbounded near 0?

But according to the substitution, it's equivalent to the Gamma function, which converges for p > -1. Since p > 0, that's certainly true. So, does that mean log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0? But I have a feeling this might not be correct because I remember that for certain functions, even though they are integrable in some L^p spaces, they might not be in others. Let me check again.

Wait, but the substitution seems straightforward. Let me verify the steps. 

Original integral: ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx (since log x is negative here). Substitute t = -log x. Then, x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Changing the limits: when x=0, t=∞; x=1, t=0. So, reversing the limits, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt. Which is indeed the Gamma function Γ(p + 1). And Γ(p + 1) is equal to p! when p is an integer, but for real p > -1, it's still finite. Therefore, for p > -1, the integral converges. Since we are given p > 0, which is a subset of p > -1, the integral is finite for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But wait, this seems counterintuitive. Let me test with a specific value. For example, take p = 1. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx. Let's compute that without substitution. Let u = -log x, dv = dx. Then du = (-1/x) dx, v = x. Integration by parts: uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [ -x log x ]₀¹ + ∫₀¹ dx. The boundary term [ -x log x ] from 0 to 1: at x=1, it's 0; at x=0, it's lim_{x→0+} -x log x. We know that lim_{x→0+} -x log x = 0 (since x approaches 0 faster than log x approaches -infty). Then the integral becomes 0 + ∫₀¹ dx = 1. So, ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx = 1. That's finite, so p=1 is okay. 

Similarly, for p=2, ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx. Let me compute that. Again, substitution t = -log x. Then, as before, ∫₀^∞ t^2 e^{-t} dt = Γ(3) = 2! = 2. So, the integral is 2, which is finite. Therefore, p=2 is also okay. 

Wait, but what about p approaching 0? If p is very small, say p=0.1, then the integral is Γ(0.1 + 1) = Γ(1.1) which is still finite. So, even for p approaching 0, the Gamma function is finite for p > -1. So, even as p approaches 0, the integral remains finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But I need to be careful. Let me check with a different approach. Suppose I don't perform the substitution. Let's analyze the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Near x=0, -log x behaves like 1/x (since log x ≈ -log(1/x) and as x approaches 0, 1/x approaches infinity). Wait, no. Wait, log x near 0 is like -log(1/x), which for x near 0, 1/x is large. Let me recall the behavior of log x near 0. 

As x approaches 0+, log x approaches -infty. So, -log x approaches +infty. Therefore, near x=0, (-log x)^p behaves like (something approaching +infty)^p. So, if p is positive, then (infty)^p is infinity. But we are integrating over x near 0. So, the integrand near 0 is like (1/x)^p, since -log x ~ -log x, but how does it relate to 1/x?

Wait, actually, near x=0, log x ≈ - (1/x - 1/(2x^2) + ...), but maybe a better approximation is needed. Alternatively, perhaps using substitution. Let me set t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, as before. Then, as x approaches 0, t approaches infinity. So, near t=∞, the integrand is t^p e^{-t}. The integral of t^p e^{-t} near t=∞ converges because the exponential decay dominates the polynomial growth. So, even though t^p grows as t approaches infinity, e^{-t} decays exponentially, so the product decays to zero. Therefore, the tail of the integral near infinity is convergent. 

But near t=0, the integrand is t^p e^{-t} ≈ t^p (since e^{-t} ≈ 1). The integral of t^p near t=0 is equivalent to ∫₀^ε t^p dt, which converges if p > -1. Since p > 0, which is greater than -1, the integral near 0 also converges. Therefore, the entire integral converges for all p > -1, and since we have p > 0, the integral is finite. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

But wait, let me check another source or recall if there's a standard result. For example, functions like log x are in all L^p spaces on (0,1) for p > 0. Because their growth near 0 is logarithmic, which is slower than any polynomial growth. So, even though log x tends to -infty as x approaches 0, its absolute value raised to any positive power p is integrable. 

Therefore, the answer should be that all p > 0 satisfy log x ∈ L^p((0,1)). 

But the problem statement says ""Return your fina Determine all values of p > 0 such that log x ∈ L^p((0,1))"" and there's a fraction 2/3. Wait, maybe there was a typo in the problem statement? The original user might have intended to include a fraction 2/3 in the question, but it's written as \\frac{2}{3}$ which might be a mistake. Maybe the original problem was to determine for which p > 0 log x is in L^p((0,1)), and the user included \\frac{2}{3}$ as part of the problem, but it's unclear. However, based on the analysis above, the answer is all p > 0. 

But let me double-check with another method. Suppose I use the substitution x = e^{-t}, then t = -log x, so when x=0, t=∞, x=1, t=0. Then, dx = -e^{-t} dt. The integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt, which is Γ(p + 1). The Gamma function Γ(z) is finite for Re(z) > 0, so here p + 1 > 0 ⇒ p > -1. Since we are given p > 0, the integral is finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. 

Therefore, the answer should be all positive real numbers p, i.e., p > 0.

**Final Answer**
The values of \\( p > 0 \\) are all real numbers greater than 0. Thus, the solution is \\(\\boxed{(0, \\infty)}\\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of p > 0 the function log x is in the L^p space on the interval (0,1). Hmm, let me start by recalling what L^p spaces are. The space L^p((0,1)) consists of all measurable functions f on (0,1) such that the integral of |f|^p over (0,1) is finite. So, in this case, I need to check if the integral of |log x|^p dx from 0 to 1 is finite.

First, since we're dealing with L^p, the absolute value of log x raised to the power p is what's important. But log x is negative on the interval (0,1), right? Because log 1 = 0, and as x approaches 0, log x approaches negative infinity. So |log x| is just -log x on (0,1). Therefore, the integral we need to evaluate is ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. And we need to find all p > 0 for which this integral is finite.

Alright, so let's write that down: ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let me think about how to evaluate this integral. Maybe substitution would help. Let me try a substitution. Let t = -log x. Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches +infty, and when x = 1, t = 0. So, the limits of integration will switch. Let's compute dx in terms of dt.

If t = -log x, then x = e^(-t). Therefore, dx = -e^(-t) dt. But since we are changing variables from x to t, and x is going from 0 to 1, t goes from +infty to 0. So, the integral becomes:

∫_{+infty}^0 t^p (-e^(-t) dt) = ∫₀^{+infty} t^p e^(-t) dt.

Wait, that's the Gamma function! The Gamma function Γ(n) = ∫₀^infty t^{n-1} e^{-t} dt. So, in this case, our integral is Γ(p + 1). But the Gamma function converges when p + 1 > 0, which is always true since p > 0. Wait, but hold on, the Gamma function is actually defined for p + 1 > 0, so p > -1. But since we are given p > 0, that's fine. Therefore, the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx equals Γ(p + 1), which is finite for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. But that seems counterintuitive because near x = 0, log x behaves like -1/x, so the function has a logarithmic singularity there. Wait, but maybe the integral converges for all p > 0. Let me think again.

Wait, but if I consider the substitution t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, so near x = 0, t approaches infinity. The integral becomes ∫₀^infty t^p e^{-t} dt, which is indeed the Gamma function. But the Gamma function converges for p > -1. However, in our case, p > 0, so it should converge. Therefore, the integral is finite for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. Hmm, but that seems surprising. Let me check with specific values of p.

For example, take p = 1. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx. Let's compute that. Let me do the substitution again. Let t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. So the integral becomes ∫₀^infty t e^{-t} dt = Γ(2) = 1! = 1. Which is finite. So p = 1 is okay. What about p = 2? Then the integral is Γ(3) = 2! = 2, which is finite. Similarly, for p = 1/2, Γ(1.5) = (sqrt(π)/2) * 1.5^{-1/2} * 1.5! Wait, but Γ(1.5) is a finite number. So indeed, for any p > 0, the integral is finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, let me verify this with another approach. Let's consider the original integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let's make another substitution, say y = x. Then, as x approaches 0, -log x approaches infinity. Let me see if I can bound the integral near 0. Let's split the integral into two parts: near 0 and away from 0. For some ε > 0, split the integral at ε: ∫₀^ε (-log x)^p dx + ∫_ε^1 (-log x)^p dx. The second integral is finite because the function is continuous on [ε,1]. The first integral is the problematic part. Let's analyze ∫₀^ε (-log x)^p dx.

Again, substitution t = -log x. Then x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. So the integral becomes ∫_{t = +infty}^{t = -log ε} t^p e^{-t} (-dt) = ∫_{-log ε}^{+infty} t^p e^{-t} dt. Wait, but as ε approaches 0, -log ε approaches +infty. So the integral becomes ∫_{A}^{+infty} t^p e^{-t} dt where A = -log ε. The integral from A to infinity of t^p e^{-t} dt is equal to Γ(p + 1, A), the upper incomplete Gamma function. As A approaches infinity, Γ(p + 1, A) approaches 0. Therefore, the integral near 0 is indeed finite. Therefore, the entire integral is finite for any p > 0.

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, let me check with p approaching 0. Suppose p approaches 0 from the right. Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. As p approaches 0, (-log x)^p approaches 1 for x ≠ 0, but near x = 0, log x approaches -infty, so (-log x)^p approaches 0 when p approaches 0. Wait, actually, for any fixed x in (0,1), as p approaches 0, (-log x)^p approaches 0 if log x is negative (which it is in (0,1)). So the limit as p approaches 0 of ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx would be ∫₀¹ 0 dx = 0. But that's not directly relevant here, since we are considering p > 0.

Alternatively, maybe for p very small, the integral is still finite. For example, take p = 1/1000. Then the integral is Γ(1 + 1/1000) which is finite. So even for very small p, the Gamma function is finite. Therefore, regardless of how small p is, as long as p > 0, the integral converges.

Therefore, the answer should be all p > 0. But let me check some references or similar problems. For example, I recall that functions with logarithmic singularities, like log x, are often in every L^p space for p > 0. For example, the function 1/x^α for α < 1 is in L^p if p > 1/(1 - α). But log x is a different case. Since log x grows to -infty as x approaches 0, but slower than any negative power of x. So, in terms of decay at 0, log x is worse than any negative power but better than a logarithmic blow-up.

Wait, but when considering integrability, even though log x approaches -infty, the absolute value raised to any positive power p is integrable over (0,1). Because when raised to power p, the integrand becomes t^p e^{-t}, which is integrable for any p > 0, as shown by the Gamma function. So, even though the original function has a singularity, when raised to any power p > 0, the integral converges.

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, let me check another way. Suppose we don't use substitution. Let's try to compute the integral ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx directly. Let's integrate by parts. Let u = (-log x)^p, dv = dx. Then du = p (-log x)^{p - 1} (1/x) dx, and v = x. So integration by parts gives:

uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [x (-log x)^p]₀¹ - ∫₀¹ x * p (-log x)^{p - 1} (1/x) dx.

Evaluating the boundary term: at x = 1, x (-log x)^p = 1 * 0 = 0. At x = 0, x (-log x)^p. Let's see, as x approaches 0, (-log x) approaches +infty, but x approaches 0. So the term is 0 * (infty)^p. This is an indeterminate form, so we need to evaluate the limit. Let t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}. Then, as x approaches 0, t approaches +infty. The term becomes e^{-t} * t^p. As t approaches infinity, e^{-t} decays exponentially, so the product e^{-t} * t^p approaches 0. Therefore, the boundary term is 0 - 0 = 0.

Therefore, the integral becomes - ∫₀¹ p (-log x)^{p - 1} dx. But that's similar to the original integral. Let me denote I(p) = ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Then, through integration by parts, we have I(p) = p I(p - 1). But this recursive relation is similar to the Gamma function's property Γ(p + 1) = p Γ(p). However, the Gamma function is defined for p > 0, and Γ(1) = 1. So, if we start with p = 1, I(1) = ∫₀¹ (-log x) dx = 1 (as we saw earlier), and then I(p) = p I(p - 1) would lead to I(p) = Γ(p + 1). Which again, holds for p > 0.

Therefore, this confirms that the integral is indeed the Gamma function Γ(p + 1), which is finite for all p > 0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But let me check for p = 0. Wait, p > 0, so p = 0 is not considered. What if p = 0? Then the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^0 dx = ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1, which is finite. But p = 0 is not in our consideration since the problem states p > 0.

Therefore, after going through substitution, Gamma function, and integration by parts, all approaches lead to the conclusion that the integral converges for any p > 0. Therefore, the answer should be all positive real numbers p.

But let me double-check with specific examples. For p = 1/2, the integral is Γ(3/2) = (sqrt(π)/2) ≈ 0.886, which is finite. For p = 100, Γ(101) is a huge number but still finite. Therefore, regardless of how large or small p is (as long as p > 0), the integral is finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

Wait a minute, but I remember that functions with logarithmic singularities are in every L^p space. For example, in some analysis textbooks, they mention that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for any p > 0. So this seems consistent.

Therefore, after all these checks and methods, I can confidently say that all values of p > 0 satisfy log x ∈ L^p((0,1)).

**Final Answer**

To determine all values of \\( p > 0 \\) such that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\), we need to check if the integral \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx \\) converges. Since \\( \\log x \\) is negative on \\( (0,1) \\), we consider the integral \\( \\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^p dx \\).

We perform a substitution to analyze the integral. Let \\( t = -\\log x \\), which transforms the integral as follows:
- When \\( x \\) approaches 0, \\( t \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\).
- When \\( x = 1 \\), \\( t = 0 \\).
- The substitution gives \\( x = e^{-t} \\) and \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\).

Changing the limits of integration accordingly, we get:
\\[
\\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^p dx = \\int_{+\\infty}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = \\int_0^{+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt
\\]

This integral is recognized as the Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\), which converges for all \\( p > -1 \\). Since we are given \\( p > 0 \\), the integral \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\) is finite for all \\( p > 0 \\).

Thus, the function \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out all values of \\( p > 0 \\) such that \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\). Hmm, let me start by recalling what \\( L^p \\) spaces are. For a function \\( f \\) on a measure space \\( (X, \\mu) \\), \\( f \\) is in \\( L^p \\) if the integral of \\( |f|^p \\) over \\( X \\) is finite. In this case, the interval is \\( (0,1) \\) with the usual Lebesgue measure. So, I need to check for which \\( p > 0 \\) the integral \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p \\, dx \\) is finite.

First, let me note that \\( \\log x \\) is negative on \\( (0,1) \\), since \\( x \\) is between 0 and 1. Therefore, \\( |\\log x| = -\\log x \\). So, the integral becomes \\( \\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^p \\, dx \\). But since \\( p \\) is positive, this is the same as \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p \\, dx \\), so maybe I can just work with \\( (-\\log x)^p \\).

Now, to evaluate this integral, I might need to perform a substitution. Let me think. The function \\( \\log x \\) is involved, so perhaps substituting \\( t = -\\log x \\). Let's try that.

If \\( t = -\\log x \\), then \\( x = e^{-t} \\), and \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\). When \\( x \\) approaches 0, \\( t \\) approaches \\( +\\infty \\), and when \\( x = 1 \\), \\( t = 0 \\). So, changing the limits accordingly, the integral becomes:

\\( \\int_{+\\infty}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = \\int_0^{+\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\).

Wait, that seems familiar. The integral \\( \\int_0^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\) is the Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\). But the Gamma function is defined for \\( p + 1 > 0 \\), which means \\( p > -1 \\). However, in our case, \\( p > 0 \\), so that would suggest that the integral converges for all \\( p > 0 \\). But that can't be right because I recall that \\( \\log x \\) is not in \\( L^1((0,1)) \\), right? Wait, but according to this substitution, if \\( p = 1 \\), the integral is \\( \\Gamma(2) = 1! = 1 \\), which is finite. But isn't that contradicting the fact that \\( \\log x \\) is not in \\( L^1((0,1)) \\)? Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, hold on. Let me check again. If \\( t = -\\log x \\), then \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\), so when I substitute, the integral becomes:

\\( \\int_{+\\infty}^0 t^p e^{-t} (-dt) = \\int_0^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\).

But \\( \\int_0^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\) is indeed the Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\), which converges for \\( p + 1 > 0 \\), i.e., \\( p > -1 \\). So, if \\( p > 0 \\), then \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\) is finite. However, this seems to contradict my initial thought that \\( \\log x \\) is not in \\( L^1 \\). Wait, but according to this substitution, \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^1 \\). Maybe I was wrong before? Let me check with \\( p = 1 \\):

Compute \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x| dx = \\int_0^1 (-\\log x) dx \\). Let's compute this integral directly. Let \\( u = -\\log x \\), then \\( x = e^{-u} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-u} du \\). Then when \\( x \\) goes from 0 to 1, \\( u \\) goes from \\( +\\infty \\) to 0. So:

\\( \\int_0^1 (-\\log x) dx = \\int_{+\\infty}^0 u (-e^{-u} du) = \\int_0^{\\infty} u e^{-u} du = \\Gamma(2) = 1! = 1 \\).

So, the integral is indeed finite, so \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^1((0,1)) \\). But wait, I thought earlier that \\( \\log x \\) was not in \\( L^1 \\). Maybe I confused it with something else. Let me check again. For example, the integral of \\( \\log x \\) over \\( (0,1) \\) is \\( \\int_0^1 \\log x dx \\). Let's compute that without substitution:

\\( \\int \\log x dx = x \\log x - x + C \\). So, evaluating from 0 to 1:

At 1: \\( 1 \\cdot 0 - 1 = -1 \\).

At 0: The limit as \\( x \\to 0^+ \\) of \\( x \\log x - x \\). The term \\( x \\log x \\) tends to 0 (as \\( x \\log x \\to 0 \\)) and \\( -x \\) also tends to 0. So, the integral is \\( (-1) - 0 = -1 \\). So, the integral of \\( \\log x \\) over \\( (0,1) \\) is \\( -1 \\), which is finite. But since we take the absolute value, \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x| dx = 1 \\), so yes, it is in \\( L^1 \\). So, my initial confusion was misplaced. So, according to this, \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^1((0,1)) \\).

But wait, the question is about \\( L^p \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). So, if the substitution gives that the integral is \\( \\Gamma(p+1) \\), which is finite for all \\( p > 0 \\), then \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). But that seems counterintuitive because \\( \\log x \\) behaves like \\( -\\log x \\) near 0, which is integrable, but does it have higher integrability?

Wait, for example, take \\( p = 2 \\). Then the integral would be \\( \\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^2 dx \\). Let's compute that using substitution:

\\( t = -\\log x \\), \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\). Then:

\\( \\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^2 dx = \\int_0^{\\infty} t^2 e^{-t} dt = \\Gamma(3) = 2! = 2 \\), which is finite. Similarly, for any \\( p > 0 \\), the integral is finite. Therefore, \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

But wait, the problem states ""Determine all values of \\( p > 0 \\) such that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\)"", and the user wrote ""such that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\).\\frac{2}{3}$"". Maybe that fraction is a typo? Because the user wrote ""such that \\( \\log x \\in L^p((0,1)) \\).\\frac{2}{3}$"", perhaps the intended question was with a different exponent, but the way it's written is confusing. But assuming the question is as stated, then according to our analysis, \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

But let me check again. Let's take \\( p = 1 \\), which we saw converges. For \\( p = 2 \\), converges. For \\( p = 3 \\), converges. For \\( p = 0.5 \\), the integral would be \\( \\Gamma(0.5 + 1) = \\Gamma(1.5) = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{2} \\), which is finite. So, even for non-integer p, it's finite. Therefore, the conclusion is that \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me verify once again. The original integral is \\( \\int_0^1 |\\log x|^p dx \\). Since \\( \\log x \\) is negative on \\( (0,1) \\), this is \\( \\int_0^1 (-\\log x)^p dx \\). Substituting \\( t = -\\log x \\), so \\( x = e^{-t} \\), \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\). The limits change from \\( x = 0 \\) (which is \\( t \\to \\infty \\)) to \\( x = 1 \\) (which is \\( t = 0 \\)), so the integral becomes:

\\( \\int_{\\infty}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = \\int_0^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\).

Yes, that's exactly the Gamma function \\( \\Gamma(p + 1) \\). The Gamma function converges for all \\( p + 1 > 0 \\), which is \\( p > -1 \\). Therefore, for \\( p > 0 \\), the integral is finite. Therefore, \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

Therefore, the answer should be all positive real numbers \\( p \\), i.e., \\( p \\in (0, \\infty) \\). But the problem says ""Determine all values of \\( p > 0 \\)"", so the answer is all \\( p > 0 \\).

Wait, but let me check once again with a different approach. Let's consider the behavior of \\( \\log x \\) near 0. As \\( x \\to 0^+ \\), \\( \\log x \\to -\\infty \\), so \\( |\\log x| \\to +\\infty \\). The question is whether \\( |\\log x|^p \\) is integrable over \\( (0,1) \\). Let's make a substitution near 0. Let \\( x = e^{-t} \\), so as \\( x \\to 0^+ \\), \\( t \\to +\\infty \\). Then \\( |\\log x| = t \\), and \\( dx = -e^{-t} dt \\). The integral near 0 is approximately:

\\( \\int_{t=0}^{\\infty} t^p e^{-t} dt \\), which is exactly the Gamma function. So, as long as \\( p + 1 > 0 \\), which is \\( p > -1 \\), the integral converges. Therefore, for all \\( p > 0 \\), the integral is finite. Therefore, \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\).

Therefore, the answer is all positive real numbers \\( p \\).

**Final Answer**
The function \\( \\log x \\) is in \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). Thus, the solution is \\( \\boxed{(0, \\infty)} \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out all the values of p > 0 such that the function log x is in the L^p space on the interval (0,1). Hmm, let me start by recalling what L^p spaces are. The L^p space, denoted as L^p((0,1)), consists of all functions f such that the integral of |f|^p over (0,1) is finite. So, basically, I need to check for which exponents p the integral of |log x|^p from 0 to 1 is finite.

First, I should probably consider the behavior of log x near 0 and near 1 because that's where the function might have issues. Let me think: as x approaches 0 from the right, log x goes to -infinity, and at x=1, log x is 0. So, near 0, the function is going to negative infinity, but since we take the absolute value, |log x| will go to positive infinity. Therefore, the integral might have a problem near 0. But I need to see if the integral converges or not for different p.

Let me write down the integral we need to evaluate: ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx. Since log x is negative on (0,1), |log x| = -log x. So, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^p dx. Let me make a substitution to evaluate this integral. Let’s set t = -log x. Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. So, solving for x, we get x = e^{-t}, and dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫_{t=∞}^{0} t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫₀^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the integral from 0 to 1 of (-log x)^p dx is equal to the integral from 0 to infinity of t^p e^{-t} dt. But hold on, isn't the integral of t^p e^{-t} dt from 0 to infinity the Gamma function, which is Γ(p+1)? And the Gamma function is defined for all p > -1, but here p is given as a positive real number. However, the Gamma function Γ(p+1) is finite for all p > -1. But since we are given p > 0, that would imply that the integral is finite for all p > 0? But that can't be right, because if p is very large, say p approaches infinity, then t^p e^{-t} might blow up. Wait, but the Gamma function Γ(p+1) is only finite for p > -1. So, does that mean that for all p > 0, the integral ∫₀¹ |log x|^p dx is finite?

But that contradicts my initial intuition because near x=0, log x is going to -infinity, so |log x| is going to infinity. But if the substitution shows that the integral is equal to Γ(p+1), which is finite for p > -1, then even for p > 0, it should be finite. Wait, but Γ(p+1) is finite for p > -1, so for p > 0, which is a subset of p > -1, the integral should be finite. Therefore, does that mean that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0?

But let me verify this with specific examples. Let's take p=1. Then, ∫₀¹ |log x| dx = ∫₀¹ -log x dx. Let me compute that. Integration by parts: let u = -log x, dv = dx. Then du = (-1/x) dx, v = x. So, uv|₀¹ - ∫₀¹ v du = [ -x log x + ∫₀¹ x*(1/x) dx ] from 0 to 1. Wait, that's [ -x log x + ∫₀¹ 1 dx ] from 0 to 1. So, evaluating at 1: -1*0 + (1 - 0) = 1. Evaluating at 0: lim_{x→0+} -x log x + 0. The limit of -x log x as x approaches 0: we can write x log x = x * ln x. As x→0+, x ln x approaches 0 (since ln x approaches -infty, but x approaches 0 faster). So, the integral is 1 - 0 = 1. So, p=1 works.

What about p=2? Then, ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx. Let me compute that. Using substitution again. Let t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. The integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^2 e^{-t} dt = Γ(3) = 2! = 2. So, that's finite. Similarly, for any integer p, the integral would be Γ(p+1) which is finite. So, even for non-integer p, as long as p > -1, Γ(p+1) is finite, so for p > 0, it's definitely finite.

Wait, so then does that mean that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0? But let me think again. Wait, the function log x is integrable near 0? Because even though it blows up to negative infinity, the integral is finite. So, even for p=1, it's integrable. For higher p, the integral still converges. Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But let me check for a specific non-integer p. Let's take p=1/2. Then, the integral becomes ∫₀¹ (-log x)^{1/2} dx. Using substitution t = -log x, the integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^{1/2} e^{-t} dt = Γ(3/2) = (1/2)√π. Which is finite. So, yes, even for p=1/2, the integral is finite.

Alternatively, suppose p approaches 0. Let's take p approaching 0 from the right. Then, (-log x)^p approaches 1 as p→0, so the integral approaches ∫₀¹ 1 dx = 1, which is finite. So, even for p approaching 0, the integral is finite.

Therefore, the conclusion seems to be that for all p > 0, the integral of |log x|^p over (0,1) is finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, let me check another way. Suppose p is approaching infinity. Then, t^p e^{-t} for large t. But as t approaches infinity, e^{-t} decays faster than any polynomial growth. So, even though t^p grows, e^{-t} decays exponentially, so the integral should still converge. For example, even for p=1000, the integral ∫₀^∞ t^{1000} e^{-t} dt is Γ(1001), which is a finite number. So, even as p becomes very large, the integral remains finite.

Therefore, regardless of how large p is, as long as p is positive, the integral is finite. Therefore, the answer should be all p > 0.

But wait, let me cross-verify with another method. Let's consider near 0 behavior. Let's approximate the function near 0. Let x approach 0, then log x ≈ -ln(1/x). Let me set x = e^{-y}, so as x approaches 0, y approaches infinity. Then, |log x| = y, so near x=0, the function behaves like y = -log x. Therefore, near x=0, |log x|^p ≈ y^p. Then, dx = e^{-y} dy. So, the integral near 0 is ∫_{y=0}^∞ y^p e^{-y} dy, which is the Gamma function again. So, the integral near 0 is Γ(p+1), and since the rest of the integral (from x=1/2 to x=1) is a finite interval where |log x| is bounded, so the total integral is finite for all p > -1. Therefore, since p > 0, it's included.

Therefore, all p > 0 satisfy the condition. Therefore, the answer is all positive real numbers p.

But let me check with p approaching 0. For example, p=0.1. Then, the substitution gives us ∫₀^∞ t^{0.1} e^{-t} dt, which is Γ(1.1), which is finite. So, even for p=0.1, the integral is finite.

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0. Hence, all p > 0 are valid.

But wait, let me check again with another approach. Let's split the integral into two parts: from 0 to 1/2 and from 1/2 to 1. On the interval [1/2,1], log x is between log(1/2) and 0, so |log x| is bounded by |log(1/2)|. Therefore, the integral over [1/2,1] of |log x|^p dx is bounded by |log(1/2)|^p * 1/2, which is finite. Therefore, the integral over [1/2,1] is finite for any p.

The problem is near 0. So, let's focus on the integral near 0. Let me set x = e^{-t}, so t = -log x. As x approaches 0, t approaches infinity. Then, dx = e^{-t} dt. The integral near 0 becomes ∫_{t=0}^∞ t^p e^{-t} dt. Wait, but earlier substitution had x from 0 to 1, which became t from infinity to 0, but flipping the limits gives the integral from 0 to infinity. So, yes, that's the Gamma function. Therefore, the integral near 0 is Γ(p+1), which is finite for p > -1. Since p > 0, this is a subset of p > -1, so the integral is finite.

Therefore, combining both parts, the total integral is finite for all p > 0. Therefore, the answer is all positive real numbers p.

But let me check with a specific non-integer p. Let's take p=0.5. Then, ∫₀¹ (-log x)^0.5 dx. Using substitution t = -log x, integral becomes ∫₀^∞ t^{0.5} e^{-t} dt = Γ(1.5) = (1/2)√π, which is approximately 0.886, which is finite.

Another example: p=2. Then, ∫₀¹ (-log x)^2 dx = Γ(3) = 2, which is finite.

Therefore, all these examples confirm that the integral is finite for any p > 0.

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

But wait, I remember that sometimes functions that are not in L^1 can be in higher L^p spaces. For example, functions with singularities can be in L^p for p > 1 if the singularity is strong enough. But in this case, log x is actually in L^p for all p > 0, which is interesting. So, that's a different behavior.

Alternatively, let's think about the function f(x) = x^a where a < -1. Then, f is not in L^1, but is in L^p for p < 1/(1 - a). But in our case, log x is a different function, and through substitution, we saw that it's in L^p for all p > 0.

Therefore, after all these checks and substitutions, I think the correct answer is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

**Final Answer**
The function \\( \\log x \\) belongs to \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all positive real numbers \\( p \\). Therefore, the solution is all values of \\( p > 0 \\).

","Okay, let's see. I need to find all positive values of p such that log x is in L^p on the interval (0,1). Hmm, L^p spaces are about functions whose p-th power is Lebesgue integrable. So, essentially, I need to check for which p > 0 the integral of |log x|^p over (0,1) is finite.

First, let me recall that log x on (0,1) is negative because x is between 0 and 1. So log x approaches -infinity as x approaches 0, and log 1 is 0. Therefore, |log x| = -log x on (0,1). So the integral we need to evaluate is the integral from 0 to 1 of (-log x)^p dx.

But maybe it's easier to consider substitution. Let me make a substitution to simplify the integral. Let’s set t = -log x. Then, when x approaches 0, t approaches +infinity, and when x = 1, t = 0. Solving for x, we get x = e^{-t}, so dx = -e^{-t} dt. Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫_{x=0}^1 (-log x)^p dx = ∫_{t=+infty}^0 t^p (-e^{-t} dt) = ∫_{t=0}^{+infty} t^p e^{-t} dt.

Wait, that's the Gamma function! The Gamma function Γ(p+1) is equal to ∫_{0}^{∞} t^p e^{-t} dt. So, the integral we're looking at is Γ(p+1). But the Gamma function is known to converge for p + 1 > 0, i.e., p > -1. However, since we are given that p > 0, this would suggest that the integral converges for all p > 0. But that can't be right, because the original function log x blows up near 0, so maybe there's a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, let me check the substitution again. If t = -log x, then x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. When x goes from 0 to 1, t goes from +infty to 0. So reversing the limits, the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{infty} t^p e^{-t} dt. Yes, that's correct. So the integral is indeed the Gamma function Γ(p+1), which converges if p +1 > 0, so p > -1. But since we are looking for p > 0, this would imply that the integral converges for all p > 0. But that contradicts intuition because log x is negative and has a singularity at 0. Wait, but in the substitution, we transformed the integral into one that is known to converge for p > -1, so even though log x is unbounded near 0, after substitution, the integral is convergent for p > -1. Therefore, for our original problem, since p > 0, the integral is finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p > 0.

Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. If log x is going to negative infinity near 0, then raising it to a power p and integrating... Does the integral really converge? Let me check with specific values. For example, take p = 1. Then the integral is ∫_{0}^1 -log x dx. Let's compute that. Let u = -log x, dv = dx. Then du = -1/x dx, v = x. So ∫ -log x dx = x(-log x) - ∫ x*(-1/x) dx = -x log x + ∫ 1 dx = -x log x + x. Evaluated from 0 to 1. At x=1, it's -0 +1 = 1. At x=0, lim_{x→0+} (-x log x +x). The term -x log x approaches 0 (since x log x →0 as x→0+), and x approaches 0. So total limit is 0. Therefore, the integral from 0 to1 of -log x dx is 1. So for p=1, it's finite.

What about p=2? Let's compute ∫_{0}^1 (-log x)^2 dx. Again, substitution t = -log x, which gives the integral as ∫_{0}^{infty} t^2 e^{-t} dt = Γ(3) = 2! =2. Which is finite. Similarly, for p=3, Γ(4)=6. So seems like for any p>0, the integral is finite. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p>0.

But let me check another way. Let's consider near x=0. The function log x behaves like -log x ~ -log ε as x approaches 0. So near 0, |log x| ~ -log x. So the integral near 0 is ∫_{0}^ε (-log x)^p dx. Let me make substitution t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫_{t=log 1/ε}^{infty} t^p e^{-t} dt. As ε approaches 0, log 1/ε approaches infinity. So the integral becomes ∫_{A}^{infty} t^p e^{-t} dt where A approaches infinity. But the Gamma function tail ∫_{A}^{infty} t^p e^{-t} dt decays exponentially as A increases. Therefore, the integral near 0 converges regardless of p>0. Therefore, the entire integral from 0 to1 of (-log x)^p dx is finite for all p>0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p>0.

But wait, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me verify with p=1/2. Then the integral is ∫_{0}^1 sqrt(-log x) dx. Let me compute this. Let t = -log x, so x=e^{-t}, dx=-e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{infty} sqrt(t) e^{-t} dt = Γ(3/2) = (1/2) sqrt(π). Which is finite. So yes, even for p=1/2, it's finite.

Therefore, it seems that regardless of p>0, the integral converges. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p>0.

But wait, another thought: If p=0, then it's not in L^0, but p>0. So according to this, all p>0 are okay. But maybe I should check another approach. Let's consider expanding the function near x=0. Let’s set x=ε, a small positive number. Then log ε ~ -log ε. So near x=0, |log x| ~ -log x. The integral near 0 is ∫_{0}^ε (-log x)^p dx. Let's make substitution x=ε, t = -log x, so t= -log ε. Then dx= -e^{-t} dt. So the integral becomes ∫_{t= -log ε}^{infty} t^p e^{-t} dt. As ε→0, t= -log ε →infty. So the integral becomes ∫_{A}^{infty} t^p e^{-t} dt, where A→infty. But this integral is known to decay rapidly for any fixed p. Therefore, the integral near x=0 is finite. The rest of the integral from ε to1 is also finite because the function is continuous there. Therefore, the entire integral is finite for any p>0.

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p>0.

But wait, let me check with another substitution. Let’s set y = -log x. Then x= e^{-y}, dx= -e^{-y} dy. So when x approaches 0, y approaches infinity; when x=1, y=0. So the integral becomes ∫_{y=0}^{infty} y^p e^{-y} dy, which is Γ(p+1). And Γ(p+1) is finite for all p+1>0, i.e., p> -1. So since p>0, this holds. Therefore, the answer is all p>0.

But wait, the original question says ""Determine all values of p >0 such that log x ∈ L^p((0,1))"". According to this, the answer is p>0. But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check with p=0. If p=0, then L^0 is different, but p>0. Wait, perhaps I should check with p approaching infinity. For example, as p becomes very large, does the integral still converge? Since near x=0, |log x|^p is very large, but with the exponential decay from the substitution, the integral still converges. Because even for large p, the Gamma function Γ(p+1) is finite for any p>0. Therefore, even as p approaches infinity, Γ(p+1) grows like p! which is infinite, but the integral remains finite for any finite p>0. Therefore, for all p>0, the integral is finite.

Therefore, the conclusion is that log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p>0.

But wait, let me check with an example. Let's take p=1. As computed earlier, the integral is 1. For p=2, it's 2. For p=3, it's 6. All finite. For p=1/2, it's (1/2)√π. So, yes, all finite. Therefore, the answer is all p>0.

But I recall that sometimes functions that blow up at the endpoint can be in L^p only for certain p. For example, 1/sqrt(x) is in L^p((0,1)) only for p<2. But in this case, log x is different. It doesn't blow up like 1/sqrt(x), but rather like -log x. The integral of (-log x)^p dx over (0,1) converges for all p>0. Therefore, the answer is all p>0.

But let me check with another approach. Let's consider the substitution t = x. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, compare to a known integral. Suppose we have ∫_{0}^1 (-log x)^p dx. Let me set t = -log x, so x = e^{-t}, dx = -e^{-t} dt. Then the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{infty} t^p e^{-t} dt = Γ(p+1). Γ(p+1) is an entire function except for poles at non-positive integers. But since p>0, p+1>1, so Γ(p+1) is finite. Therefore, the conclusion is that the integral converges for all p>0. Therefore, log x is in L^p((0,1)) for all p>0.

Therefore, the answer is all positive real numbers p>0.

**Final Answer**
The function \\( \\log x \\) belongs to \\( L^p((0,1)) \\) for all \\( p > 0 \\). Thus, the solution is \\( \\boxed{(0, \\infty)} \\).
