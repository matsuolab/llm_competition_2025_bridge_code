To determine the values of \\( p \\) for which the series \\( \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\left(\\ln(\\ln(n))\\right)^p} \\) converges, we use the integral test. 

First, we check that the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} \\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \\( x \\geq 3 \\). Since all components of the denominator are positive and increasing for \\( x \\geq 3 \\), \\( f(x) \\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing. 

Next, we evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} dx \\) using substitution. Let \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\). Then, \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x)} dx \\), transforming the integral into \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\).

The integral \\( \\int_{a}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\) converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, the original series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

Thus, the values of \\( p \\) for which the series converges are \\(\\boxed{p > 1}\\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of p the series ∑_{n=3}^∞ 1/(n ln n (ln(ln n))^p) converges. Hmm, let me start by recalling some tests for convergence of series. The most common ones are the comparison test, the integral test, and maybe the ratio test? But since the terms here involve logarithms, the integral test might be the way to go because the function f(n) = 1/(n ln n (ln(ln n))^p) is positive and decreasing for n ≥ 3, right?

First, let me confirm that the function is positive and decreasing. Since n, ln n, and ln(ln n) are all positive for n ≥ 3, the denominator is positive, so the terms are positive. To check if it's decreasing, let's consider the function f(x) = 1/(x ln x (ln(ln x))^p). Taking the derivative might be complicated, but maybe intuitively, since all the components in the denominator are increasing functions for x ≥ 3, their product is increasing, so 1 over that should be decreasing. That seems plausible, so the conditions for the integral test are satisfied.

Therefore, the series converges if and only if the integral from 3 to infinity of 1/(x ln x (ln(ln x))^p) dx converges. Let me write that down:

∫_{3}^∞ [1 / (x ln x (ln(ln x))^p)] dx

To evaluate this integral, maybe substitution would help. Let me set u = ln(ln x). Then, du/dx = (1 / ln x) * (1 / x). Wait, that's exactly the derivative of ln(ln x). So du = (1 / (x ln x)) dx. That's convenient because in the integrand, we have 1/(x ln x (ln(ln x))^p) dx, which would become 1/(u^p) du.

So, substituting, the integral becomes ∫_{u(3)}^{u(∞)} [1 / u^p] du. Let's compute the limits. When x = 3, u = ln(ln 3). When x approaches infinity, u approaches ln(ln ∞), which is infinity. So the integral is ∫_{ln(ln 3)}^∞ [1 / u^p] du.

This is a standard integral. The integral of u^{-p} du from some constant to infinity converges if and only if p > 1. Because for p = 1, the integral would be ln u from a to infinity, which diverges. For p > 1, the integral is [u^{1 - p}/(1 - p)] from a to infinity. As u approaches infinity, u^{1 - p} goes to zero (since 1 - p is negative), so the integral converges. For p ≤ 1, the integral diverges.

Therefore, the original series converges if and only if p > 1. Wait, but let me double-check. The substitution steps: when u = ln(ln x), then du = (1/(x ln x)) dx, which matches the integrand's 1/(x ln x) part. So the substitution is valid. Then, the integral becomes ∫_{ln(ln 3)}^∞ u^{-p} du. Yes, that's correct. So the result is indeed that the integral converges when p > 1.

But wait, let me check if there's a mistake here. For example, when p = 0, the integral becomes ∫_{ln(ln 3)}^∞ 1 du, which diverges. If p = 1, it's ∫_{ln(ln 3)}^∞ 1/u du, which is ln u evaluated from ln(ln 3) to infinity, which diverges. So yes, only when p > 1 does the integral converge. Therefore, the original series converges when p > 1.

But let me verify with another approach. Maybe using the Cauchy condensation test? Wait, no, the integral test is straightforward here. Alternatively, could we use the comparison test? Let's see. Suppose we compare the given series with another series. For example, consider that for large n, ln(ln n) is increasing, so maybe we can compare to a series like 1/(n (ln n)^{1 + ε}) for some ε > 0. But that might not be directly helpful.

Alternatively, think of the series as a generalization of the harmonic series with logarithmic terms. The standard integral test for convergence of ∑1/(n ln n) is known to diverge, because the integral ∫1/(x ln x) dx = ln(ln x) from 2 to infinity, which diverges. So adding another logarithmic term in the denominator, (ln(ln n))^p, would make the terms smaller, so we need to see how much smaller they are. If p > 1, then the integral converges, as we saw. If p = 1, then the integral is similar to the divergent case, and if p < 1, the integral diverges even faster. So yes, p > 1 is the condition.

Wait, but let me check with p = 2. Then the integral would be ∫_{ln(ln 3)}^∞ 1/u^2 du = [-1/u] from ln(ln 3) to ∞ = 0 - (-1/ln(ln 3)) = 1/ln(ln 3), which is finite. So that converges. For p = 1, ∫_{a}^∞ 1/u du = ∞, so diverges. For p = 0.5, ∫_{a}^∞ 1/√u du = 2√u from a to ∞, which diverges. So yes, p must be greater than 1.

Therefore, the answer is p > 1. Wait, but let me confirm once again. The substitution was correct, right? Let me redo the substitution steps. Let u = ln(ln x). Then, differentiate both sides:

du/dx = (1/ln x) * (1/x) => du = (1/(x ln x)) dx. Therefore, the integral ∫ [1/(x ln x (ln(ln x))^p)] dx = ∫ [1/(u^p)] du. So that's correct. Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{ln(ln 3)}^∞ u^{-p} du, which converges iff p > 1. Therefore, the original series converges iff p > 1.

But just to make sure, let's test with specific values. For p = 2, the series should converge. Let's take the integral:

∫_{3}^∞ [1/(x ln x (ln(ln x))^2)] dx. Substituting u = ln(ln x), du = 1/(x ln x) dx, so the integral becomes ∫_{ln(ln 3)}^∞ [1/u^2] du, which is [-1/u] evaluated from ln(ln 3) to ∞, which is 1/ln(ln 3). So that's finite. Therefore, converges.

For p = 1, the integral becomes ∫_{ln(ln 3)}^∞ [1/u] du = ln u from ln(ln 3) to ∞, which diverges. Similarly, for p = 0.5, it's ∫_{ln(ln 3)}^∞ [1/√u] du, which diverges. Therefore, the critical point is p = 1. So the series converges when p > 1.

Therefore, the answer is p > 1. So the values of p for which the series converges are all real numbers greater than 1.

**Final Answer**
The series converges for all \\( p > 1 \\). Thus, the solution is \\boxed{p > 1}.

The integral \\( \\int_{a}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\) converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, the original series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

Thus, the values of \\( p \\) for which the series converges are \\(\\boxed{p > 1}\\).

<|end_of_solution|>

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, let's try to figure out for which values of \\( p \\) the series \\( \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\left(\\ln(\\ln(n))\\right)^p} \\) converges. Hmm, I remember that to determine the convergence of a series involving logarithms, the integral test is often useful. So maybe I should start by applying the integral test here. 

First, the integral test states that if \\( f(n) \\) is a positive, continuous, and decreasing function for \\( n \\geq N \\), then the series \\( \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} f(n) \\) converges if and only if the integral \\( \\int_{N}^{\\infty} f(x) dx \\) converges. So, in this case, we can let \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} \\). 

Now, we need to check if \\( f(x) \\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing. Well, for \\( x \\geq 3 \\), all the components of the denominator are positive, so \\( f(x) \\) is positive. It's also continuous since the logarithm and its nested functions are continuous for \\( x \\geq 3 \\). As for being decreasing, let's see. The denominator is a product of three increasing functions: \\( x \\), \\( \\ln(x) \\), and \\( (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p \\). Since all these functions are increasing, their product is increasing, so \\( f(x) \\) is decreasing. Therefore, the conditions for the integral test are satisfied.

So, now we need to evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} dx \\). Let me try to compute this integral. Let's perform a substitution to simplify it. Let me set \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\). Then, the derivative of \\( u \\) with respect to \\( x \\) is \\( du/dx = \\frac{1}{\\ln(x)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} \\). Wait, because the derivative of \\( \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{\\ln(x)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} \\), right? So \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x)} dx \\). 

That's perfect because that's exactly the term in the denominator of our integrand. So substituting, our integral becomes \\( \\int_{u(3)}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\). Now, what's \\( u(3) \\)? Let's compute \\( \\ln(\\ln(3)) \\). Since \\( \\ln(3) \\) is approximately 1.0986, so \\( \\ln(\\ln(3)) \\) is \\( \\ln(1.0986) \\), which is approximately 0.094. But we don't need the exact value; we can just keep it as \\( \\ln(\\ln(3)) \\).

Therefore, the integral simplifies to \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\). Now, we can focus on evaluating this integral. The integral of \\( u^{-p} \\) with respect to \\( u \\) is:

- If \\( p \\neq 1 \\), then it's \\( \\frac{u^{1 - p}}{1 - p} \\).
- If \\( p = 1 \\), it's \\( \\ln|u| \\).

But since we're integrating from \\( \\ln(\\ln(3)) \\) to \\( \\infty \\), we need to check the convergence of the integral. Let's consider different cases based on the value of \\( p \\):

**Case 1: \\( p > 1 \\)**

In this case, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{u^{1 - p}}{1 - p} \\right]_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{b} = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{b^{1 - p}}{1 - p} - \\frac{(\\ln(\\ln(3)))^{1 - p}}{1 - p} \\right)
\\]

Since \\( p > 1 \\), \\( 1 - p \\) is negative, so \\( b^{1 - p} = b^{-(p - 1)} \\), which approaches 0 as \\( b \\to \\infty \\). Therefore, the integral converges to \\( \\frac{0 - (\\ln(\\ln(3)))^{1 - p}}{1 - p} = \\frac{ - (\\ln(\\ln(3)))^{1 - p} }{1 - p} \\), which is a finite value. Therefore, the integral converges when \\( p > 1 \\).

**Case 2: \\( p = 1 \\)**

Here, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\ln|u| \\right]_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{b} = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left( \\ln(b) - \\ln(\\ln(\\ln(3))) \\right)
\\]

But \\( \\ln(b) \\) approaches infinity as \\( b \\to \\infty \\), so the integral diverges when \\( p = 1 \\).

**Case 3: \\( p < 1 \\)**

In this case, the integral becomes:

\\[
\\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{u^{1 - p}}{1 - p} \\right]_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{b} = \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left( \\frac{b^{1 - p}}{1 - p} - \\frac{(\\ln(\\ln(3)))^{1 - p}}{1 - p} \\right)
\\]

Since \\( p < 1 \\), \\( 1 - p \\) is positive, so \\( b^{1 - p} \\) approaches infinity as \\( b \\to \\infty \\). Therefore, the integral diverges when \\( p < 1 \\).

Putting it all together, the integral converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). By the integral test, the original series converges if and only if the integral converges. Therefore, the series converges when \\( p > 1 \\).

Wait, let me double-check my substitution steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The substitution was \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\), so \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x)} dx \\), which matches the denominator of the integrand. Then the integral simplifies correctly. The limits of integration: when \\( x = 3 \\), \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(3)) \\), and as \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\( \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\to \\infty \\). So the substitution seems correct.

Another way to confirm: Let's consider the behavior of the original function for large \\( n \\). The general term is \\( \\frac{1}{n \\ln(n) (\\ln(\\ln(n)))^p} \\). For the series to converge, the terms must decay faster than \\( \\frac{1}{n} \\), but given that we have logarithmic factors, the convergence is related to the behavior of the logarithms. The integral test is indeed the appropriate method here because the function is positive, continuous, and decreasing for sufficiently large \\( n \\).

Let me also think about the comparison test. If we consider the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} \\), perhaps comparing it to a known convergent or divergent series. But the integral test seems more straightforward here since the function is nicely behaved for substitution.

Alternatively, another substitution could be used. Let me try \\( v = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\), which is essentially what I did earlier. Wait, that's the same substitution. So, yes, that substitution works.

Another check: Let's consider \\( p = 2 \\). Then the integral becomes \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^2} dx \\). Using substitution \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\), \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x)} dx \\), so the integral becomes \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^2} du \\), which converges to \\( \\frac{1}{\\ln(\\ln(3))} \\). So finite, hence converges.

Similarly, if \\( p = 0.5 \\), the integral becomes \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^{0.5}} du = 2 u^{0.5} \\) evaluated from \\( \\ln(\\ln(3)) \\) to \\( \\infty \\), which diverges. So that's consistent with our previous conclusion.

Therefore, I can be confident that the series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

**Final Answer**
The series converges for \\( p > 1 \\), so the values of \\( p \\) are \\boxed{p > 1}.

Thus, the values of \\( p \\) for which the series converges are \\(\\boxed{p > 1}\\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of \\( p \\) the series \\( \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\left(\\ln(\\ln(n))\\right)^p} \\) converges. Hmm, let's start by recalling some convergence tests for series. The integral test comes to mind because the terms of the series are positive, decreasing, and the function involved is continuous for \\( n \\geq 3 \\). Let me verify that first.

The function \\( f(n) = \\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\left(\\ln(\\ln(n))\\right)^p} \\) is positive for \\( n \\geq 3 \\) since all the components in the denominator are positive. Now, is it decreasing? Let's check the derivative. If \\( f(n) \\) is decreasing, then its derivative should be negative. Taking the logarithm of \\( f(n) \\) might make differentiation easier. Let me set \\( f(n) = e^{-\\ln(n) - p\\ln(\\ln(\\ln(n)))} \\). Wait, maybe that's complicating things. Alternatively, consider the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} \\). Let's compute its derivative.

Using the chain rule, the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) would involve the derivative of the denominator. Let's denote \\( u = x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p \\). Then \\( f(x) = 1/u \\), so \\( f'(x) = -u'/u^2 \\). To check if \\( f'(x) < 0 \\), we need \\( u' > 0 \\). Let's compute \\( u' \\):

\\( u = x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p \\)

First, take the derivative of each part. Use the product rule:

\\( u' = \\frac{d}{dx}[x \\ln x] \\cdot (\\ln(\\ln x))^p + x \\ln x \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}[(\\ln(\\ln x))^p] \\)

Compute each part:

1. \\( \\frac{d}{dx}[x \\ln x] = \\ln x + x \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = \\ln x + 1 \\)
2. \\( \\frac{d}{dx}[(\\ln(\\ln x))^p] = p (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p - 1} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}[\\ln(\\ln x)] \\)
   - \\( \\frac{d}{dx}[\\ln(\\ln x)] = \\frac{1}{\\ln x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} \\)

Putting it all together:

\\( u' = (\\ln x + 1)(\\ln(\\ln x))^p + x \\ln x \\cdot p (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p - 1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} \\)

Simplify the second term:

\\( x \\ln x \\cdot p (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p - 1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} = p (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p - 1} \\)

So,

\\( u' = (\\ln x + 1)(\\ln(\\ln x))^p + p (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p - 1} \\)

All terms here are positive for \\( x \\geq 3 \\), so \\( u' > 0 \\). Therefore, \\( f(x) \\) is decreasing. Thus, the integral test is applicable.

So, according to the integral test, the series converges if and only if the integral \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} dx \\) converges. Let's compute this integral.

To evaluate \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} dx \\), we can perform substitution. Let me set \\( u = \\ln(\\ln x) \\). Then, compute \\( du \\):

First, \\( \\ln x = \\ln x \\), so \\( \\ln(\\ln x) = u \\).

Compute \\( du \\):

\\( du = \\frac{d}{dx}[\\ln(\\ln x)] dx = \\frac{1}{\\ln x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} dx \\)

Thus, \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} dx \\)

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\\( \\int_{u(3)}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\)

Compute \\( u(3) \\):

\\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\). Let's denote this as a constant. So the integral is from \\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\) to \\( \\infty \\) of \\( u^{-p} du \\).

The integral of \\( u^{-p} \\) is:

- If \\( p \\neq 1 \\), then \\( \\frac{u^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} \\)
- If \\( p = 1 \\), then \\( \\ln|u| \\)

Therefore, the integral converges if and only if the improper integral of \\( u^{-p} \\) from \\( a \\) to \\( \\infty \\) converges. Let's recall that \\( \\int_{a}^{\\infty} u^{-q} du \\) converges if and only if \\( q > 1 \\). In our case, \\( q = p \\). Therefore, the integral converges when \\( p > 1 \\).

Wait, but hold on. Let me check again. The integral \\( \\int_{a}^{\\infty} u^{-p} du \\) is equal to \\( \\frac{u^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} \\) evaluated from \\( a \\) to \\( \\infty \\). This will converge only if the exponent \\( -p + 1 < 0 \\), which implies \\( p > 1 \\). If \\( p = 1 \\), the integral becomes \\( \\ln u \\) evaluated from \\( a \\) to \\( \\infty \\), which diverges. If \\( p < 1 \\), the integral diverges as well. So indeed, the integral converges only when \\( p > 1 \\).

Therefore, the original series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

Wait, but let me just verify if the substitution was correct. Let's go step by step:

Original integral: \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} dx \\)

Substitute \\( u = \\ln(\\ln x) \\). Then, \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} dx \\), so \\( dx = x \\ln x du \\). But in terms of \\( u \\), how does \\( x \\) relate to \\( u \\)?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake here. Let's re-examine the substitution.

Let \\( u = \\ln(\\ln x) \\). Then, let me solve for \\( x \\):

\\( u = \\ln(\\ln x) \\implies e^u = \\ln x \\implies e^{e^u} = x \\)

Therefore, \\( x = e^{e^u} \\). Then, \\( dx = e^{e^u} \\cdot e^u du \\). Hmm, that seems complicated. Wait, but earlier, I had:

\\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} dx \\implies dx = x \\ln x du \\)

But \\( x \\ln x = e^{e^u} \\cdot e^u \\). So, substituting back into the integral:

\\( \\int \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} dx = \\int \\frac{1}{(e^{e^u} \\cdot e^u) \\cdot u^p} \\cdot x \\ln x du \\)

But \\( x \\ln x = e^{e^u} \\cdot e^u \\), so substituting:

\\( \\int \\frac{1}{(e^{e^u} \\cdot e^u) \\cdot u^p} \\cdot e^{e^u} \\cdot e^u du = \\int \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\)

Ah, so the substitution does simplify correctly. The \\( e^{e^u} \\cdot e^u \\) cancels out, leaving \\( \\int u^{-p} du \\). Therefore, the integral is indeed equal to \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln 3)}^{\\infty} u^{-p} du \\), which converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, the original series converges exactly when \\( p > 1 \\).

But wait, let's check the lower limit. When \\( n = 3 \\), \\( u = \\ln(\\ln 3) \\). However, the integral from \\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\) to \\( \\infty \\) is valid as long as \\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\) is a positive constant, which it is, since \\( \\ln 3 > 1 \\), so \\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\) is positive. Therefore, the integral is improper only at the upper limit, and the convergence depends on the exponent \\( p \\).

Therefore, the conclusion is that the series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

Wait, but let me test with specific values. For example, take \\( p = 2 \\). Then the integral becomes \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln 3)}^{\\infty} u^{-2} du = \\left[ -\\frac{1}{u} \\right]_{\\ln(\\ln 3)}^{\\infty} = 0 + \\frac{1}{\\ln(\\ln 3)} \\), which converges. For \\( p = 1 \\), the integral becomes \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln 3)}^{\\infty} u^{-1} du = \\ln u \\bigg|_{\\ln(\\ln 3)}^{\\infty} \\), which diverges. For \\( p = 0.5 \\), the integral diverges as well. So yes, only when \\( p > 1 \\) does the integral converge.

Therefore, the answer should be \\( p > 1 \\).

But wait, let me check again if there's a mistake in the substitution steps. Another way to approach the integral is to perform a substitution step by step.

Original integral: \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} dx \\)

Let me make a substitution \\( t = \\ln x \\). Then, \\( dt = \\frac{1}{x} dx \\implies dx = x dt = e^{t} dt \\). So when \\( x = 3 \\), \\( t = \\ln 3 \\), and as \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\( t \\to \\infty \\).

Therefore, the integral becomes:

\\( \\int_{\\ln 3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{e^{t} \\cdot t \\cdot (\\ln t)^p} \\cdot e^{t} dt = \\int_{\\ln 3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{t (\\ln t)^p} dt \\)

So now, the integral simplifies to \\( \\int_{\\ln 3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{t (\\ln t)^p} dt \\).

Now, perform another substitution. Let \\( u = \\ln t \\). Then, \\( du = \\frac{1}{t} dt \\implies dt = t du = e^{u} du \\). When \\( t = \\ln 3 \\), \\( u = \\ln(\\ln 3) \\), and as \\( t \\to \\infty \\), \\( u \\to \\infty \\).

Thus, the integral becomes:

\\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln 3)}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\)

Which is the same as before. So, this confirms that the integral reduces to \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln 3)}^{\\infty} u^{-p} du \\), which converges iff \\( p > 1 \\).

Therefore, the conclusion is that the original series converges when \\( p > 1 \\).

But let me check another source or example. For instance, the standard series \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{n \\ln n (\\ln \\ln n)^p} \\) is a known type, and I recall that it converges when \\( p > 1 \\). So this aligns with our conclusion.

Therefore, the values of \\( p \\) for which the series converges are all real numbers \\( p > 1 \\).

**Final Answer**
The series converges for \\( p > 1 \\), so the values of \\( p \\) are \\boxed{p > 1}.

To determine the values of \\( p \\) for which the series \\( \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\left(\\ln(\\ln(n))\\right)^p} \\) converges, we use the integral test. 

First, we check that the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} \\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \\( x \\geq 3 \\). Since all components of the denominator are positive and increasing for \\( x \\geq 3 \\), \\( f(x) \\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing. 

Next, we evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} dx \\) using substitution. Let \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\). Then, \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x)} dx \\), transforming the integral into \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\).

The integral \\( \\int_{a}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\) converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, the original series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

Thus, the values of \\( p \\) for which the series converges are \\(\\boxed{p > 1}\\).

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of p the series ∑_{n=3}^∞ [1/(n ln(n) (ln(ln(n)))^p)] converges. Hmm, let me start by recalling some convergence tests for series. I remember that for series involving logarithms, the integral test is often useful. Let me try applying the integral test here.

First, let me verify that the function f(n) = 1/(n ln(n) (ln(ln(n)))^p) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for n ≥ 3. Since n is increasing, ln(n) is also increasing, and ln(ln(n)) is increasing as well (for n > e, which it is here since we start at n=3). Therefore, each part of the denominator is increasing, so the whole denominator is increasing, which means f(n) is positive, continuous, and decreasing. So the integral test applies.

Alright, so I need to evaluate the integral from 3 to infinity of [1/(x ln(x) (ln(ln(x)))^p)] dx. Let me make a substitution to simplify this integral. Let's set u = ln(ln(x)). Then, let's compute du in terms of dx.

First, let me find du:

Let u = ln(ln(x)).

Then, du/dx = derivative of ln(ln(x)) with respect to x.

Using the chain rule: derivative of ln(u) is 1/u * du/dx, where u = ln(x). So:

du/dx = [1/ln(x)] * [1/x] = 1/(x ln(x)).

Wait, that's exactly the derivative of ln(ln(x))! So du = [1/(x ln(x))] dx.

Therefore, the integral becomes:

∫ [1/(x ln(x) (ln(ln(x)))^p)] dx = ∫ [1/u^p] du.

So substituting u, the integral from x=3 to x=∞ becomes the integral from u=ln(ln(3)) to u=∞ of [1/u^p] du.

But wait, let's check the limits. When x approaches infinity, ln(x) approaches infinity, so ln(ln(x)) approaches infinity as well. When x=3, ln(3) is a positive number, so ln(ln(3)) is ln(ln(3)), which is ln of a positive number, but ln(3) is approximately 1.0986, so ln(ln(3)) is ln(1.0986) which is a small positive number, approximately 0.094. So the lower limit is a positive constant, and the upper limit is infinity.

Therefore, the integral becomes ∫_{ln(ln(3))}^{∞} [1/u^p] du.

Now, the integral of 1/u^p du is a standard integral. Let's recall that ∫_{a}^{∞} 1/u^p du converges if and only if p > 1. Wait, but here the lower limit is a positive constant, not 0. Wait, actually, for convergence at infinity, the integral ∫_{a}^{∞} 1/u^p du converges if p > 1, and diverges otherwise. So regardless of a, as long as a is positive, the convergence depends on p > 1.

Therefore, the integral converges if and only if p > 1. Therefore, by the integral test, the original series converges if and only if p > 1.

Wait, but hold on. Let me verify that substitution again to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me retrace the steps.

Original function: 1/(x ln(x) (ln(ln(x)))^p).

Substitution: u = ln(ln(x)).

Then, du = [1/(x ln(x))] dx, which matches the denominator of the original integrand except for the (ln(ln(x)))^p part. So yes, substituting, the integral becomes ∫ [1/u^p] du, which is correct.

Therefore, the integral converges if and only if p > 1. Therefore, the series converges if and only if p > 1. So the answer should be p > 1.

Wait, but let me check with another test to be sure. Maybe the Cauchy condensation test? But the integral test seems straightforward here. Alternatively, maybe compare it to a known convergent series.

Alternatively, consider that for large x, the behavior of the function is similar to 1/(x ln(x) (ln(ln(x)))^p). The integral test tells us that the convergence depends on the behavior at infinity, so the substitution leading to the integral of 1/u^p is the key.

Alternatively, maybe using the Cauchy condensation test: For a positive, decreasing sequence a_n, the series ∑a_n converges if and only if the series ∑2^k a_{2^k} converges. Let's try applying that.

Let a_n = 1/(n ln(n) (ln(ln(n)))^p). Then, a_{2^k} = 1/(2^k ln(2^k) (ln(ln(2^k)))^p).

Simplify ln(2^k) = k ln(2), and ln(ln(2^k)) = ln(k ln(2)) = ln(k) + ln(ln(2)).

So a_{2^k} = 1/(2^k * k ln(2) * (ln(k) + ln(ln(2)))^p).

Then, 2^k a_{2^k} = 1/(k ln(2) * (ln(k) + ln(ln(2)))^p).

So the condensed series is ∑_{k=3}^∞ [1/(k ln(2) (ln(k) + ln(ln(2)))^p)].

Since ln(2) is a constant, this is similar to ∑ [1/(k (ln(k))^p)] multiplied by constants. So the condensed series converges if and only if the series ∑ [1/(k (ln(k))^p)] converges.

Now, we can apply the integral test again to this condensed series. Let's consider ∫_{k=2}^∞ [1/(k (ln(k))^p)] dk. Let substitution v = ln(k), dv = 1/k dk. Then, the integral becomes ∫_{v=ln(2)}^∞ [1/v^p] dv. Which converges if and only if p > 1. Therefore, the condensed series converges if and only if p > 1, so the original series converges if and only if p > 1.

Therefore, both the integral test and the Cauchy condensation test lead to the same conclusion. So the answer is p > 1.

Wait, but let me check once more. Maybe I made a mistake in substitution steps.

Original series: sum from n=3 to infinity of 1/(n ln n (ln ln n)^p). Applying integral test, integral from 3 to infinity of 1/(x ln x (ln ln x)^p) dx. Substitution u = ln ln x, du = 1/(x ln x) dx. Therefore, integral becomes ∫_{ln ln 3}^{infty} 1/u^p du, which is the same as the integral ∫_{a}^{infty} 1/u^p du, which converges when p > 1. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe use another substitution, like t = ln ln x. Wait, same substitution. Yeah, seems correct.

Alternatively, think of the function as 1/(x ln x (ln ln x)^p) and compare to 1/(x ln x). The integral of 1/(x ln x) dx is ln ln x, which diverges. So if we have 1/(x ln x (ln ln x)^p), the convergence depends on the exponent p. If p > 1, then (ln ln x)^p grows as (ln ln x)^{1 + something}, so the integral converges. If p ≤ 1, then the integral diverges.

Therefore, by the integral test, the series converges if and only if p > 1. So the answer is p > 1.

But the user wrote ""Return your fina Determine the values of p for which the series... is convergent. $frac{2}{3}$"". Wait, maybe they were trying to include a value for p=2/3, but in their request they just say ""frac{2}{3}$"" at the end. Maybe that was a mistake. But regardless, the answer is p > 1.

Wait, but let me check with p=1. If p=1, then the integral becomes ∫ [1/u] du from u=ln ln 3 to infinity, which diverges. If p=2, then ∫ [1/u^2] du converges. So the critical value is p=1. Therefore, the series converges when p > 1.

Therefore, the answer is p > 1.

**Final Answer**
The series converges for \\(\\boxed{p > 1}\\).

The integral \\( \\int_{a}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\) converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, the original series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

Thus, the values of \\( p \\) for which the series converges are \\(\\boxed{p > 1}\\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of \\( p \\) the series \\( \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\left(\\ln(\\ln(n))\\right)^p} \\) converges. Hmm, let's start by recalling some convergence tests for series. The terms here involve logarithms, which often hint towards the integral test or the Cauchy condensation test. Since the general term is positive, decreasing (I assume), and continuous for \\( n \\geq 3 \\), the integral test might be applicable here.

First, let me confirm that the function \\( f(n) = \\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\left(\\ln(\\ln(n))\\right)^p} \\) is positive, decreasing, and continuous for \\( n \\geq 3 \\). Well, \\( n \\) is positive, \\( \\ln(n) \\) is positive for \\( n \\geq 3 \\), and \\( \\ln(\\ln(n)) \\) is positive as long as \\( \\ln(n) > 1 \\), which happens when \\( n > e \\approx 2.718 \\). Since our series starts at \\( n=3 \\), that's definitely true. So all components in the denominator are positive, making the function positive. 

Now, is it decreasing? Let's check the derivative. Let me set \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} \\). To see if it's decreasing, take the derivative and check if it's negative. Let's compute \\( f'(x) \\):

Using the quotient rule or product rule. Let me write \\( f(x) = [x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p]^{-1} \\). So the derivative would be:

\\( f'(x) = -1 \\cdot [x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p]^{-2} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx}[x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p] \\)

Compute the derivative inside:

Let me denote \\( u = x \\ln x \\) and \\( v = (\\ln(\\ln x))^p \\). Then, the derivative of \\( u \\times v \\) is \\( u' v + u v' \\).

First, \\( u = x \\ln x \\), so \\( u' = \\ln x + 1 \\).

Second, \\( v = (\\ln(\\ln x))^p \\). Let's compute \\( v' \\):

Let \\( w = \\ln(\\ln x) \\), so \\( v = w^p \\), and \\( v' = p w^{p-1} \\cdot w' \\).

Compute \\( w' \\):

\\( w = \\ln(\\ln x) \\), so \\( w' = \\frac{1}{\\ln x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} \\).

Therefore, \\( v' = p (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} \\).

Putting it all together:

\\( \\frac{d}{dx}[x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p] = (\\ln x + 1)(\\ln(\\ln x))^p + x \\ln x \\cdot p (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} \\)

Simplify term by term:

First term: \\( (\\ln x + 1)(\\ln(\\ln x))^p \\)

Second term: \\( x \\ln x \\cdot p (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p-1} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} = p (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p-1} \\)

So overall:

\\( (\\ln x + 1)(\\ln(\\ln x))^p + p (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p-1} \\)

Factor out \\( (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p-1} \\):

\\( (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p-1} [ (\\ln x + 1)\\ln(\\ln x) + p ] \\)

Therefore, the derivative of \\( f(x) \\) is:

\\( f'(x) = - [x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p]^{-2} \\cdot (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p-1} [ (\\ln x + 1)\\ln(\\ln x) + p ] \\)

All terms in the denominator are positive for \\( x \\geq 3 \\), and \\( (\\ln(\\ln x))^{p-1} \\) is positive as well. The expression inside the brackets is \\( (\\ln x + 1)\\ln(\\ln x) + p \\), which is definitely positive since \\( \\ln x \\) and \\( \\ln(\\ln x) \\) are positive. Therefore, the entire derivative is negative, which means \\( f(x) \\) is decreasing for \\( x \\geq 3 \\). So the integral test applies.

Therefore, the series converges if and only if the integral \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} dx \\) converges.

So now, let's compute this integral. Let's make a substitution. Let me set \\( u = \\ln(\\ln x) \\). Then, compute \\( du \\).

First, let me compute \\( u = \\ln(\\ln x) \\). Let me differentiate this:

\\( du/dx = \\frac{1}{\\ln x} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} \\)

Therefore, \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} dx \\), which is exactly the term we have in the integrand. So, substituting:

\\( \\int \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} dx = \\int \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\)

So the integral becomes \\( \\int u^{-p} du \\), which is straightforward.

But we need to adjust the limits of integration. When \\( x = 3 \\), \\( u = \\ln(\\ln 3) \\). Let's compute that: \\( \\ln 3 \\approx 1.0986 \\), so \\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\approx \\ln(1.0986) \\approx 0.094 \\). As \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\( \\ln x \\to \\infty \\), so \\( \\ln(\\ln x) \\to \\infty \\). Therefore, the integral becomes:

\\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln 3)}^{\\infty} u^{-p} du \\)

Now, compute this integral:

\\( \\int u^{-p} du = \\frac{u^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} + C \\), as long as \\( -p + 1 \\neq 0 \\), i.e., \\( p \\neq 1 \\).

Therefore, the definite integral from \\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\) to \\( \\infty \\):

If \\( p \\neq 1 \\), then:

\\( \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\left[ \\frac{u^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} \\right]_{\\ln(\\ln 3)}^{b} \\)

Let's compute this:

\\( \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\frac{b^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} - \\frac{(\\ln(\\ln 3))^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} \\)

Now, let's analyze the behavior as \\( b \\to \\infty \\):

- If \\( -p + 1 > 0 \\), i.e., \\( p < 1 \\), then \\( b^{-p + 1} \\to \\infty \\), so the limit diverges.
- If \\( -p + 1 = 0 \\), i.e., \\( p = 1 \\), then the integral becomes \\( \\int u^{-1} du = \\ln |u| \\), which would evaluate to \\( \\lim_{b \\to \\infty} \\ln b - \\ln(\\ln(\\ln 3)) \\), which diverges.
- If \\( -p + 1 < 0 \\), i.e., \\( p > 1 \\), then \\( b^{-p + 1} \\to 0 \\), so the limit becomes \\( - \\frac{(\\ln(\\ln 3))^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} = \\frac{(\\ln(\\ln 3))^{-p + 1}}{p - 1} \\), which is a finite value. Therefore, the integral converges.

Therefore, the integral converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Hence, by the integral test, the original series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

Wait, but let me verify this again. The substitution step: when I set \\( u = \\ln(\\ln x) \\), then \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} dx \\), so the integral \\( \\int \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} dx \\) becomes \\( \\int \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\). That seems right. Then, integrating \\( u^{-p} \\) gives \\( \\frac{u^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} \\), as long as \\( p \\neq 1 \\). Then, when \\( p > 1 \\), the exponent \\( -p + 1 \\) is negative, so \\( u^{-p + 1} \\) tends to 0 as \\( u \\to \\infty \\), making the integral converge. If \\( p \\leq 1 \\), the integral diverges. So yes, the conclusion is that the series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

But let me check with an example. For instance, if \\( p = 2 \\), then the integral becomes \\( \\int u^{-2} du = \\frac{-1}{u} + C \\), evaluated from \\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\) to infinity. As \\( u \\to \\infty \\), \\( -1/u \\to 0 \\), so the integral is \\( 0 - (-1/\\ln(\\ln 3)) = 1/\\ln(\\ln 3) \\), which is finite. Therefore, converges. If \\( p = 1 \\), the integral is \\( \\ln u \\), which diverges. If \\( p = 0.5 \\), then the integral is \\( \\frac{u^{0.5}}{0.5} \\), which goes to infinity as \\( u \\to \\infty \\), so diverges. Therefore, indeed, only when \\( p > 1 \\) does the integral converge.

Therefore, the answer should be that the series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). But wait, the user mentioned ""Determine the values of \\( p \\) for which the series... is convergent."" So, the answer is \\( p > 1 \\).

But let me check if there was a mistake in the substitution step. Let's see:

Original integral: \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln x (\\ln(\\ln x))^p} dx \\)

Set \\( u = \\ln(\\ln x) \\). Then, \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln x} dx \\). Therefore, \\( dx = x \\ln x du \\). Wait, but substituting back, we have:

\\( x \\ln x du = dx \\). So then, the integral becomes:

\\( \\int \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\), with the limits changing. When \\( x = 3 \\), \\( u = \\ln(\\ln 3) \\). When \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\( u \\to \\infty \\). Therefore, the substitution is correct. Therefore, the integral is indeed \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln 3)}^{\\infty} u^{-p} du \\), which is correct.

Therefore, the result is correct. The series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

But wait, the problem statement mentions ""Return your fina Determine the values of \\( p \\) for which the series... is convergent."" But in the user's message, there's a fragment: ""Return your fina Determine the values of \\( p \\) for which the series... is convergent. \\frac{2}{3}$"". Maybe that's a typo or something. But regardless, the answer is \\( p > 1 \\).

But let me think again. Wait, sometimes when dealing with multiple logarithms, the convergence criteria can be different. For example, in the case of \\( \\sum 1/(n (\\ln n)^p) \\), the convergence is when \\( p > 1 \\). Similarly, here, we have an extra logarithm in the denominator. So, perhaps the convergence is when \\( p > 1 \\). So, the answer is \\( p > 1 \\).

Alternatively, maybe I should check using the Cauchy condensation test. Let's see. The Cauchy condensation test says that if \\( a_n \\) is a non-increasing sequence of non-negative terms, then \\( \\sum a_n \\) converges if and only if \\( \\sum 2^k a_{2^k} \\) converges. Let's try applying that here.

Compute \\( a_{2^k} = \\frac{1}{2^k \\ln(2^k) (\\ln(\\ln(2^k)))^p} \\)

Simplify:

\\( \\ln(2^k) = k \\ln 2 \\)

\\( \\ln(\\ln(2^k)) = \\ln(k \\ln 2) = \\ln k + \\ln(\\ln 2) \\)

Therefore, \\( a_{2^k} = \\frac{1}{2^k \\cdot k \\ln 2 \\cdot (\\ln k + \\ln(\\ln 2))^p} \\)

Then, the condensed series is \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^k \\cdot k \\ln 2 \\cdot (\\ln k + \\ln(\\ln 2))^p} \\)

Factor out constants:

\\( \\frac{1}{\\ln 2} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^k k (\\ln k + \\ln(\\ln 2))^p} \\)

The \\( \\frac{1}{\\ln 2} \\) is a constant factor, so convergence depends on the sum \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{2^k k (\\ln k + \\ln(\\ln 2))^p} \\)

But \\( 2^k \\) in the denominator makes the terms decay exponentially, but multiplied by \\( \\frac{1}{k (\\ln k)^p} \\). Wait, but the exponential decay dominates, so regardless of \\( p \\), the terms decay exponentially, hence the series converges. Wait, that contradicts the previous result. But that can't be. Wait, no, the Cauchy condensation test is supposed to give equivalent convergence. But here, the condensed series would actually converge regardless of \\( p \\), which is not possible. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my application.

Wait, no. The Cauchy condensation test requires that \\( a_n \\) is non-increasing. In our case, \\( a_n = \\frac{1}{n \\ln n (\\ln(\\ln n))^p} \\). For large \\( n \\), \\( \\ln(\\ln n) \\) grows very slowly. So, even though \\( \\ln(\\ln n) \\) grows, the main term is \\( \\frac{1}{n \\ln n} \\), which is similar to the previous case. But with an extra logarithmic factor. Wait, but if we condense, the condensed series is:

\\( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{2^k \\cdot k \\ln 2 \\cdot (\\ln(k \\ln 2))^p} \\)

But \\( \\ln(k \\ln 2) = \\ln k + \\ln(\\ln 2) \\), which is approximately \\( \\ln k \\) for large \\( k \\). So, the condensed series is similar to \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{2^k k (\\ln k)^p} \\). Since \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{2^k k (\\ln k)^p} \\) converges regardless of \\( p \\), because \\( 2^k \\) decays exponentially and \\( k (\\ln k)^p \\) grows polynomially, the condensed series converges. But according to the integral test, the original series converges only when \\( p > 1 \\). There's a contradiction here.

Wait, no. The integral test and Cauchy condensation test should agree. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check.

Wait, the Cauchy condensation test says that if \\( a_n \\) is non-increasing, then \\( \\sum a_n \\) converges iff \\( \\sum 2^k a_{2^k} \\) converges. But in our case, \\( a_n = \\frac{1}{n \\ln n (\\ln(\\ln n))^p} \\). So, the condensed series is \\( \\sum 2^k a_{2^k} \\). Let's compute that again:

\\( 2^k a_{2^k} = 2^k \\cdot \\frac{1}{2^k \\ln(2^k) (\\ln(\\ln(2^k)))^p} = \\frac{1}{\\ln(2^k) (\\ln(\\ln(2^k)))^p} = \\frac{1}{k \\ln 2 (\\ln(k \\ln 2))^p} \\)

So, the condensed series is \\( \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k \\ln 2 (\\ln(k \\ln 2))^p} \\)

Which is \\( \\frac{1}{\\ln 2} \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{k (\\ln(k \\ln 2))^p} \\)

As \\( k \\to \\infty \\), \\( \\ln(k \\ln 2) \\approx \\ln k \\), so the series behaves like \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{k (\\ln k)^p} \\)

But the series \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{k (\\ln k)^p} \\) is known to converge if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, the condensed series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, the original series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). So, this matches the integral test result. Therefore, there was a mistake in my previous reasoning when I thought the condensed series converges regardless of \\( p \\). Actually, the condensed series reduces to \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{k (\\ln k)^p} \\), which converges only when \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, the conclusion is correct.

Therefore, the answer is \\( p > 1 \\).

But let me check once more for possible errors. Suppose \\( p = 2 \\). Then, the integral test gives convergence, and the condensed series is \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{k (\\ln k)^2} \\), which is known to converge. If \\( p = 1 \\), the integral becomes divergent, and the condensed series becomes the harmonic series \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{k \\ln k} \\), which diverges. If \\( p = 0.5 \\), the condensed series is \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{k (\\ln k)^{0.5}} \\), which diverges. Therefore, all methods agree that convergence occurs only when \\( p > 1 \\).

Therefore, the final answer is \\( p > 1 \\), which in boxed form is \\boxed{(1, \\infty)} or \\boxed{p > 1}. Since the question asks for the values of \\( p \\), the appropriate notation is \\( p > 1 \\), so boxed as \\boxed{p > 1}.

To determine the values of \\( p \\) for which the series \\( \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\left(\\ln(\\ln(n))\\right)^p} \\) converges, we use the integral test. 

First, we check that the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} \\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \\( x \\geq 3 \\). Since all components of the denominator are positive and increasing for \\( x \\geq 3 \\), \\( f(x) \\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing. 

Next, we evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} dx \\) using substitution. Let \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\). Then, \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x)} dx \\), transforming the integral into \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\).

The integral \\( \\int_{a}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\) converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, the original series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

Thus, the values of \\( p \\) for which the series converges are \\(\\boxed{p > 1}\\).

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, so I need to figure out for which values of \\( p \\) the series \\( \\sum_{n=3}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{n\\ln(n)\\left(\\ln(\\ln(n))\\right)^p} \\) converges. Hmm, let me think. I remember that for series involving logarithms, the integral test is often useful. Maybe I can apply the integral test here. The integral test says that if a function \\( f(x) \\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \\( x \\geq N \\), then the series \\( \\sum_{n=N}^{\\infty} f(n) \\) converges if and only if the integral \\( \\int_{N}^{\\infty} f(x) dx \\) converges. 

So, first, I need to check if the function \\( f(x) = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} \\) is positive, continuous, and decreasing for \\( x \\geq 3 \\). Well, for \\( x \\geq 3 \\), \\( \\ln(x) \\) is positive and increasing, so \\( \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\) is also positive but increases very slowly. The denominator is a product of positive functions, so \\( f(x) \\) is positive. It's also continuous for \\( x > 1 \\), since the logarithms are defined and continuous there. To check if it's decreasing, let's look at the derivative. But maybe instead of taking the derivative, I can reason about it. Since each term in the denominator is increasing (as \\( x \\) increases, \\( x \\), \\( \\ln(x) \\), and \\( \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\) all increase), the entire denominator increases, so \\( f(x) \\) decreases. Therefore, the integral test applies here.

So, now I need to evaluate the integral \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} dx \\) and determine for which \\( p \\) this integral converges. Let's make a substitution to simplify this integral. Let me set \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\). Then, we need to find \\( du \\) in terms of \\( dx \\).

First, let's compute \\( du \\). Let me do this step by step. Let \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\). Then, \\( du/dx = \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(\\ln(x)) = \\frac{1}{\\ln(x)} \\cdot \\frac{d}{dx} \\ln(x) = \\frac{1}{\\ln(x)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{x} \\). Therefore, \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x)} dx \\). 

Wait, that's interesting. The integrand of our original integral is \\( \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} dx \\), which can be written as \\( \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\). So, substituting \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\), the integral becomes \\( \\int_{u(3)}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\). Let me check the limits of integration. When \\( x = 3 \\), \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(3)) \\). Since \\( \\ln(3) \\) is approximately 1.0986, so \\( \\ln(\\ln(3)) \\) is approximately \\( \\ln(1.0986) \\approx 0.094 \\). So the lower limit is \\( \\ln(\\ln(3)) \\), and the upper limit is \\( \\infty \\).

Therefore, the integral becomes \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\). Now, this is a standard integral. The integral \\( \\int_{a}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\) converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Because for \\( p \\neq 1 \\), the integral is \\( \\left[ \\frac{u^{-p + 1}}{-p + 1} \\right]_{a}^{\\infty} \\). If \\( p > 1 \\), then \\( -p + 1 < 0 \\), so as \\( u \\to \\infty \\), \\( u^{-p + 1} \\to 0 \\), so the integral becomes \\( \\frac{a^{-p + 1}}{p - 1} \\), which is finite. If \\( p = 1 \\), the integral becomes \\( \\ln(u) \\) evaluated from \\( a \\) to \\( \\infty \\), which diverges. If \\( p < 1 \\), then \\( -p + 1 > 0 \\), so as \\( u \\to \\infty \\), \\( u^{-p + 1} \\to \\infty \\), so the integral diverges.

Therefore, the integral \\( \\int_{3}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} dx \\) converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, by the integral test, the original series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\).

Wait, but let me double-check my substitution steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's go through the substitution again. Let \\( u = \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\). Then, \\( du = \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x)} dx \\). Therefore, \\( dx = x \\ln(x) du \\). But in the original integral, we have \\( \\int \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) (\\ln(\\ln(x)))^p} dx \\). Substituting \\( dx \\), this becomes \\( \\int \\frac{1}{x \\ln(x) u^p} \\cdot x \\ln(x) du = \\int \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\). Yes, that's correct. The \\( x \\ln(x) \\) terms cancel out, so we are left with \\( \\int \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\). So the limits of integration are from \\( u(3) \\) to \\( u(\\infty) \\). As \\( x \\to \\infty \\), \\( \\ln(\\ln(x)) \\to \\infty \\), so the upper limit is indeed \\( \\infty \\). Therefore, the integral is \\( \\int_{\\ln(\\ln(3))}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{u^p} du \\), which, as established, converges only when \\( p > 1 \\).

Therefore, the series converges when \\( p > 1 \\).

But wait, let me check if there's another method to confirm this result. Maybe the Cauchy condensation test? Although the Cauchy condensation test is usually applied to series with terms decreasing to zero and positive, but since we already applied the integral test and got a result, maybe it's redundant. Alternatively, maybe compare it to the p-series. But the p-series is for \\( \\sum 1/n^p \\), but here we have multiple logarithms in the denominator. 

Alternatively, consider the general form of a series with multiple logarithms. For example, the general case for series like \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{n (\\ln n)^{k_1} (\\ln \\ln n)^{k_2} \\dots} \\). I think that such series converge if the ""last"" exponent is greater than 1. In this case, the ""last"" exponent is \\( p \\) in \\( (\\ln \\ln n)^p \\), so if \\( p > 1 \\), the series converges. Which matches our previous result.

Alternatively, let's think recursively. Suppose we let \\( u = \\ln \\ln n \\), then perhaps the series can be compared to \\( \\sum \\frac{1}{n \\ln n u^p} \\). But maybe that complicates things. The integral test seems straightforward here.

Wait, but just to be thorough, let me check with specific values of \\( p \\). For example, if \\( p = 1 \\), the integral becomes \\( \\int \\frac{1}{u} du \\), which is \\( \\ln u \\) from \\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\) to \\( \\infty \\), which diverges. If \\( p = 2 \\), the integral is \\( \\int \\frac{1}{u^2} du = -\\frac{1}{u} \\) evaluated from \\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\) to \\( \\infty \\), which converges to \\( \\frac{1}{\\ln(\\ln 3)} \\). So that's finite. If \\( p = 0.5 \\), the integral becomes \\( \\int u^{-0.5} du = 2 u^{0.5} \\), evaluated from \\( \\ln(\\ln 3) \\) to \\( \\infty \\), which diverges. Therefore, yes, only when \\( p > 1 \\) does the integral converge.

Therefore, the answer is that the series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). So the values of \\( p \\) are those greater than 1.

**Final Answer**
The series converges if and only if \\( p > 1 \\). Therefore, the values of \\( p \\) are \\(\\boxed{p > 1}\\).

Given the equations:

1. \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\)
2. \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2\\)
3. \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

We need to express \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of \\(p\\).

First, we denote the common value of \\(ax^2\\), \\(by^2\\), and \\(cz^2\\) as \\(k\\). Thus, we have:
\\[ ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k \\]

From this, we can express \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) as:
\\[ x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}}, \\quad y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{b}}, \\quad z = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{c}} \\]

\\[ \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\]

This simplifies to:
\\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\]
\\[ \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\]

Next, we substitute \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) into equation 1:
\\[ a^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{a} \\right)^{3/2} + b^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{b} \\right)^{3/2} + c^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{c} \\right)^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

\\[ (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) k^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

Using \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\) from equation 3:
\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\right) k^{3/2} = p^5 \\]
\\[ \\frac{k^2}{p} = p^5 \\]
\\[ k^2 = p^6 \\]
\\[ k = p^3 \\]

Substituting \\(k = p^3\\) back into \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\):
\\[ \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p^3}}{p} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{p} = p^{1/2} = \\sqrt{p} \\]

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, so I have this problem here with three equations and I need to express the sum of the square roots of a, b, and c in terms of p. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me list out the given equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\)
2. \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2\\)
3. \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

And I need to find \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of p. Hmm. Let me think about how these equations connect. The second equation says that ax², by², and cz² are all equal. Maybe I can set them equal to some common variable? Let's call that common value k. So:

\\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k\\)

That might make things easier. So then, from each of these, I can solve for a, b, and c in terms of k, x, y, z. For example:

\\(a = \\frac{k}{x^2}\\)

\\(b = \\frac{k}{y^2}\\)

\\(c = \\frac{k}{z^2}\\)

Okay, so now a, b, c are expressed in terms of k and x, y, z. Maybe I can substitute these into the first equation. Let's try that.

The first equation is \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\). Substituting a, b, c gives:

\\(\\left(\\frac{k}{x^2}\\right)^2 x^3 + \\left(\\frac{k}{y^2}\\right)^2 y^3 + \\left(\\frac{k}{z^2}\\right)^2 z^3 = p^5\\)

Simplifying each term:

First term: \\(\\frac{k^2}{x^4} \\times x^3 = \\frac{k^2}{x}\\)

Second term: \\(\\frac{k^2}{y^4} \\times y^3 = \\frac{k^2}{y}\\)

Third term: \\(\\frac{k^2}{z^4} \\times z^3 = \\frac{k^2}{z}\\)

So the equation becomes:

\\(\\frac{k^2}{x} + \\frac{k^2}{y} + \\frac{k^2}{z} = p^5\\)

Factor out \\(k^2\\):

\\(k^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} \\right) = p^5\\)

But wait, equation 3 is \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\). So substituting that in:

\\(k^2 \\times \\frac{1}{p} = p^5\\)

Therefore:

\\(k^2 = p^6\\)

Taking square roots:

\\(k = p^3\\) (assuming k is positive, which I think we can do because we're dealing with square roots and variables likely positive)

So k is \\(p^3\\). Now, going back to the expressions for a, b, c in terms of k:

\\(a = \\frac{k}{x^2} = \\frac{p^3}{x^2}\\)

\\(b = \\frac{k}{y^2} = \\frac{p^3}{y^2}\\)

\\(c = \\frac{k}{z^2} = \\frac{p^3}{z^2}\\)

So now we have a, b, c in terms of x, y, z and p. The next step is probably to express \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of p. Let's compute each square root:

\\(\\sqrt{a} = \\sqrt{\\frac{p^3}{x^2}} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{x}\\)

Similarly:

\\(\\sqrt{b} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{y}\\)

\\(\\sqrt{c} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{z}\\)

Therefore, the sum is:

\\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = p^{3/2} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} \\right)\\)

But from equation 3, we know that \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\). So substituting that in:

\\(p^{3/2} \\times \\frac{1}{p} = p^{1/2}\\)

Simplifying:

\\(p^{1/2} = \\sqrt{p}\\)

Wait, but the problem mentions expressing the sum in terms of p, and according to this, it's \\(\\sqrt{p}\\). However, the user also wrote a fractional number \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) at the end. Maybe I made a mistake here? Let me check again.

Starting again, perhaps. Let me verify each step.

First, setting \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k\\). That seems okay. Then substituting into equation 1:

\\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\)

Expressed in terms of k:

\\(\\left(\\frac{k}{x^2}\\right)^2 x^3 + \\left(\\frac{k}{y^2}\\right)^2 y^3 + \\left(\\frac{k}{z^2}\\right)^2 z^3\\)

Simplify:

\\(\\frac{k^2}{x^4} x^3 + \\frac{k^2}{y^4} y^3 + \\frac{k^2}{z^4} z^3 = \\frac{k^2}{x} + \\frac{k^2}{y} + \\frac{k^2}{z}\\)

Factor out \\(k^2\\):

\\(k^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} \\right) = p^5\\)

From equation 3, \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\), so:

\\(k^2 \\times \\frac{1}{p} = p^5 \\implies k^2 = p^6 \\implies k = p^3\\). That seems right.

Then, expressions for a, b, c:

\\(a = \\frac{p^3}{x^2}\\), so \\(\\sqrt{a} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{x}\\). Similarly for b and c.

Sum of square roots:

\\(p^{3/2} \\left( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} \\right) = p^{3/2} \\times \\frac{1}{p} = p^{1/2}\\). So that's \\(\\sqrt{p}\\). But the user mentioned \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Maybe the answer is supposed to be \\(\\sqrt{p}\\)? But why is there a \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) mentioned?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check again.

Wait, equation 3 is \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\). Then, the sum of square roots is \\(p^{3/2} \\times \\frac{1}{p} = p^{3/2 - 1} = p^{1/2}\\). So that's correct. However, maybe the answer is supposed to be \\(p^{1/2}\\), which is \\(\\sqrt{p}\\). But the user included \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) at the end. Maybe that was a typo or perhaps I missed something.

Wait, let me check the first equation again. The first equation is \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\). Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, since \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k\\), perhaps we can express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c. Let's see:

From \\(ax^2 = k\\), we get \\(x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}}\\)

Similarly, \\(y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{b}}\\), \\(z = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{c}}\\)

Then, substituting into equation 3:

\\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{k}} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

Factor out \\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}\\):

\\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\)

But earlier, we found that k = p³. So substituting:

\\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p^3}}{p} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{p} = p^{1/2}\\)

Same result. So that's \\(\\sqrt{p}\\). So why is there a \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) mentioned? Maybe the user made a typo, or perhaps there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, let me check the first equation again. If the first equation is \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\), and we express x, y, z in terms of k and a, b, c, perhaps there's another way.

Alternatively, maybe we can express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c and substitute into equation 3. Let me try that.

From \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k\\), we can write x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c). Then, equation 3:

\\(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k/a}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k/b}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k/c}} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

Which is:

\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{k}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{b}}{\\sqrt{k}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

Which is the same as:

\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

Therefore:

\\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\)

But we found earlier that k = p³, so:

\\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p^3}}{p} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{p} = p^{1/2}\\)

So again, \\(\\sqrt{p}\\). So unless there's a miscalculation here, the answer should be \\(\\sqrt{p}\\). However, maybe I made a mistake in the value of k?

Wait, let's check the calculation of k again. From equation 1:

\\(k^2 \\times \\frac{1}{p} = p^5 \\implies k^2 = p^6 \\implies k = p^3\\). Yes, that's correct. So substituting back, we get \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\sqrt{p}\\).

But maybe the problem expects a different form? Let me check if there's an alternative approach.

Alternatively, let's suppose that ax² = by² = cz² = t (instead of k). Then, similar steps follow.

From equation 3:

\\( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p} \\)

If x = sqrt(t/a), then 1/x = sqrt(a/t), similarly for y and z. Then:

\\( \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{t}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{t}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{t}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\)

Which is:

\\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{t}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\implies \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{t}}{p} \\)

Now, from equation 1:

\\( a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5 \\)

Expressed in terms of t:

\\( \\left( \\frac{t}{x^2} \\right)^2 x^3 + \\left( \\frac{t}{y^2} \\right)^2 y^3 + \\left( \\frac{t}{z^2} \\right)^2 z^3 = p^5 \\)

Simplifying each term:

\\( \\frac{t^2}{x^4} x^3 = \\frac{t^2}{x} \\), similarly for others. So:

\\( \\frac{t^2}{x} + \\frac{t^2}{y} + \\frac{t^2}{z} = p^5 \\implies t^2 \\left( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} \\right) = p^5 \\)

Again, substitute equation 3:

\\( t^2 \\times \\frac{1}{p} = p^5 \\implies t^2 = p^6 \\implies t = p^3 \\)

Therefore, \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p^3}}{p} = \\sqrt{p}\\). Same result.

Hmm. So unless there's a different interpretation, I think the answer is \\(\\sqrt{p}\\). But the user mentioned \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Maybe there's an error in the problem statement? Or perhaps I missed something.

Wait, let's check if the first equation is supposed to be \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\). Maybe there's a different exponent? Or maybe the variables are related differently.

Alternatively, perhaps the equations are meant to be connected through another relation. For example, if we set \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k\\), then x, y, z are proportional to 1/sqrt(a), 1/sqrt(b), 1/sqrt(c). Let's see:

If \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k\\), then:

\\(x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}}\\), \\(y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{b}}\\), \\(z = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{c}}\\)

Then, equation 3:

\\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{k}} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

Which is:

\\(\\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

Thus, \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\)

From equation 1:

\\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\)

Substituting x, y, z:

\\(a^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{a} \\right)^{3/2} + b^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{b} \\right)^{3/2} + c^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{c} \\right)^{3/2} = p^5\\)

Simplify each term:

\\(a^2 \\times \\frac{k^{3/2}}{a^{3/2}} = a^{1/2} k^{3/2}\\)

Similarly for the others. So:

\\(a^{1/2} k^{3/2} + b^{1/2} k^{3/2} + c^{1/2} k^{3/2} = p^5\\)

Factor out \\(k^{3/2}\\):

\\(k^{3/2} (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) = p^5\\)

But from above, \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\). Substitute that in:

\\(k^{3/2} \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} = p^5\\)

Simplify:

\\(k^{3/2 + 1/2} / p = p^5 \\implies k^2 / p = p^5 \\implies k^2 = p^6 \\implies k = p^3\\)

Same result as before. Therefore, substituting back:

\\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p^3}}{p} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{p} = p^{1/2} = \\sqrt{p}\\)

So, the answer should be \\(\\sqrt{p}\\). The mention of \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) is confusing. Maybe the original problem had different exponents? For example, if the first equation was \\(a^{2/3}x^3 + b^{2/3}y^3 + c^{2/3}z^3 = p^5\\), but that's just speculation. Alternatively, maybe there's a different variable relation.

Wait, let me check if the equations were written correctly. The first equation is \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\). The second equation is \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2\\). Third equation is the harmonic mean.

Alternatively, perhaps the variables a, b, c are related to x, y, z in another way. Let me think. If ax² = by² = cz², then maybe we can set ax² = by² = cz² = t, and then express a, b, c in terms of t and x, y, z.

Wait, but that's what I did earlier. So unless there's a different interpretation, I can't see how the answer would involve \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\). Perhaps the user made a typo, and the answer is \\(\\sqrt{p}\\), which can be written as \\(p^{1/2}\\). If the problem is expecting an answer in terms of p with exponent 1/2, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem had a different exponent in the first equation. For example, if the first equation was \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^{5/2}\\), then the answer would be p^{3/2 - 1} = p^{1/2} as well, but that's still the same.

Alternatively, maybe the problem wants the expression in terms of p^{2/3} or something. Wait, but according to the calculations, it's p^{1/2}.

Alternatively, perhaps the user intended to write a different equation. For example, if the first equation was \\(a^{1/2}x^3 + b^{1/2}y^3 + c^{1/2}z^3 = p^5\\), then the answer would be different. But as per the given equation, it's a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵.

Wait, maybe I should check if the equations are dimensionally consistent. Let's assume all variables are positive real numbers. Let me assign some exponents to check.

Suppose we let ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c). Then, equation 3 is 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p, which becomes sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p. Then, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. From equation 1, substituting x, y, z:

a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = a²*(k/a)^{3/2} + b²*(k/b)^{3/2} + c²*(k/c)^{3/2} = a^{1/2}k^{3/2} + b^{1/2}k^{3/2} + c^{1/2}k^{3/2} = k^{3/2}(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) = k^{3/2}*(sqrt(k)/p) = k^{3/2}*sqrt(k)/p = k^2/p = p^5. Therefore, k^2 = p^6 => k = p^3. Then sqrt(k) = p^{3/2}, so sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So all steps check out.

Therefore, the answer is sqrt(p). Maybe the user was trying to trick me with the 2/3, but unless there's a miscalculation, I think it's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem was supposed to have the first equation as \\(a^{2/3}x^3 + b^{2/3}y^3 + c^{2/3}z^3 = p^5\\), which would lead to a different exponent. But given the problem as stated, I think sqrt(p) is the correct answer.

Given the equations:

1. \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\)
2. \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2\\)
3. \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

We need to express \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of \\(p\\).

First, we denote the common value of \\(ax^2\\), \\(by^2\\), and \\(cz^2\\) as \\(k\\). Thus, we have:
\\[ ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k \\]

From this, we can express \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) as:
\\[ x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}}, \\quad y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{b}}, \\quad z = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{c}} \\]

Substituting these into equation 3:
\\[ \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\]

This simplifies to:

\\[ \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\]

Next, we substitute \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) into equation 1:
\\[ a^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{a} \\right)^{3/2} + b^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{b} \\right)^{3/2} + c^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{c} \\right)^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

\\[ (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) k^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

Using \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\) from equation 3:

\\[ \\frac{k^2}{p} = p^5 \\]
\\[ k^2 = p^6 \\]
\\[ k = p^3 \\]

Substituting \\(k = p^3\\) back into \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\):

<|begin_of_explanation|>

","Okay, let's try to tackle this problem. It has three equations, and we need to express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. Hmm, let me see. The equations are:

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵
2. ax² = by² = cz²
3. 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p

First, I need to figure out how these equations relate to each other and how I can manipulate them to get the desired expression. Let me start by looking at the second equation: ax² = by² = cz². Maybe I can set this common value equal to some variable to make things easier. Let's call that common value k. So, ax² = by² = cz² = k. That might help me express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c, and k. 

From ax² = k, I can solve for x: x = sqrt(k/a). Similarly, y = sqrt(k/b) and z = sqrt(k/c). Wait, but 1/x, 1/y, 1/z are in the third equation. Let me write that out:

1/x = sqrt(a/k), 1/y = sqrt(b/k), 1/z = sqrt(c/k). Then, the third equation becomes sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p. Let me factor out 1/sqrt(k):

( sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) ) / sqrt(k) = 1/p.

Hmm, so if I let S = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c), then S / sqrt(k) = 1/p, which implies that sqrt(k) = S * p. So k = S² * p². That might be useful later.

Now, moving to the first equation: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Let me substitute x, y, z from the second equation into this. Since x = sqrt(k/a), then x³ = (k/a)^(3/2). Similarly, y³ = (k/b)^(3/2) and z³ = (k/c)^(3/2). Plugging into the first equation:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = p⁵.

Simplify each term:

a² * (k^(3/2)/a^(3/2)) = a^(1/2) * k^(3/2)

Similarly, the other terms become b^(1/2) * k^(3/2) and c^(1/2) * k^(3/2). So the equation becomes:

( sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) ) * k^(3/2) = p⁵.

But we already know from the third equation that sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = S = sqrt(k)/p. Wait, from earlier, sqrt(k) = S * p. So substituting S into the first equation:

( sqrt(k)/p ) * k^(3/2) = p⁵.

Simplify the left side: sqrt(k) * k^(3/2) = k^(2) / p. So:

k² / p = p⁵ → k² = p⁶ → k = p³ (since k is positive, I assume).

Then, from earlier, sqrt(k) = S * p. Since k = p³, sqrt(k) = p^(3/2). Therefore:

p^(3/2) = S * p → S = p^(3/2) / p = p^(1/2) = sqrt(p).

Wait, so does that mean S = sqrt(p)? That seems straightforward, but let me check my steps again.

Starting again:

We set ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c).

Third equation: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p → sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p.

Factor out 1/sqrt(k): [sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)] / sqrt(k) = 1/p → sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p.

First equation: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Substitute x³, etc.:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = p⁵.

Each term simplifies to sqrt(a) * k^(3/2), so total is (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) * k^(3/2) = p⁵.

But from the third equation, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Substitute into first equation:

( sqrt(k)/p ) * k^(3/2) = p⁵ → sqrt(k) * k^(3/2) = p⁶ → k² = p⁶ → k = p³.

Then, from sqrt(k)/p = S → sqrt(p³)/p = S → p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = sqrt(p) = S.

So yes, S = sqrt(p). Therefore, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(p). But wait, the problem says ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p."" So is the answer just sqrt(p)? That seems too straightforward, but let me verify.

Wait, let me check with k = p³. Then from the third equation:

sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p = sqrt(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = sqrt(p). So yes, that's correct.

But let me verify with the first equation as well. If k = p³, then:

First equation: (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) * k^(3/2) = sqrt(p) * (p³)^(3/2) = sqrt(p) * p^(9/2) = p^(5) = p⁵. Which matches the right-hand side. So that checks out.

Therefore, it seems that √a + √b + √c = sqrt(p). But wait, let me check if there are any assumptions made here. For example, assuming that k is positive, which seems reasonable. Also, all variables a, b, c, x, y, z, p are presumably positive real numbers to have real square roots. So unless there's a step I missed, the answer is sqrt(p).

But wait, the problem statement says ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p."" So unless there's a miscalculation, I think that's the answer. Let me check once again.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in substituting or simplifying. Let me go through the steps again.

Starting with the second equation: ax² = by² = cz² = k. So x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c). Then 1/x = sqrt(a/k), 1/y = sqrt(b/k), 1/z = sqrt(c/k). Adding them up:

sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p. Factor out 1/sqrt(k):

( sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) ) / sqrt(k) = 1/p → sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Let's call this equation (4).

Now, first equation: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Substitute x³ = (k/a)^(3/2), so a²*(k/a)^(3/2) = a² * k^(3/2)/a^(3/2) = a^(1/2) * k^(3/2). Similarly for others. So total:

( sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) ) * k^(3/2) = p⁵.

From equation (4), sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Substitute into the first equation:

( sqrt(k)/p ) * k^(3/2) = p⁵ → sqrt(k) * k^(3/2) = p⁶ → k^(2) = p⁶ → k = p³.

Substitute k = p³ into equation (4):

sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = sqrt(p).

Yes, that's correct. So the answer is sqrt(p). Therefore, the expression √a + √b + √c equals sqrt(p). Hmm, seems straightforward, but let me check if there's another approach or if I missed something.

Alternatively, maybe using ratios. Since ax² = by² = cz², let's say this common value is k. Then, as before, x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c). Then, 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p. Let me denote sqrt(a) = A, sqrt(b) = B, sqrt(c) = C. Then, the equation becomes (A + B + C)/sqrt(k) = 1/p → A + B + C = sqrt(k)/p. But from the first equation, substituting x, y, z:

a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = (A²)^2*(k/a)^(3/2) + (B²)^2*(k/b)^(3/2) + (C²)^2*(k/c)^(3/2) = A^4*(k/a)^(3/2) + B^4*(k/b)^(3/2) + C^4*(k/c)^(3/2).

Wait, maybe this approach complicates things. Let me see.

Alternatively, since ax² = by² = cz², we can set ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c). Then, 1/x = sqrt(a/k), 1/y = sqrt(b/k), 1/z = sqrt(c/k). Sum to 1/p. So (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(k) = 1/p. So sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p.

Now, in the first equation, a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Substitute x³, y³, z³:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = a^(1/2)*k^(3/2) + b^(1/2)*k^(3/2) + c^(1/2)*k^(3/2) = (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) * k^(3/2) = p⁵.

But from earlier, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Substitute:

(sqrt(k)/p) * k^(3/2) = p⁵ → sqrt(k) * k^(3/2) = p⁶ → k² = p⁶ → k = p³.

Thus, sqrt(k)/p = sqrt(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = sqrt(p). Therefore, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(p).

Yes, that's consistent. So I think the answer is sqrt(p). Therefore, the final answer is sqrt(p), which in boxed form is \\boxed{\\sqrt{p}}.

Given the equations:

1. \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\)
2. \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2\\)
3. \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

We need to express \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of \\(p\\).

First, we denote the common value of \\(ax^2\\), \\(by^2\\), and \\(cz^2\\) as \\(k\\). Thus, we have:
\\[ ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k \\]

From this, we can express \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) as:
\\[ x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}}, \\quad y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{b}}, \\quad z = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{c}} \\]

Substituting these into equation 3:
\\[ \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\]

This simplifies to:
\\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\]
\\[ \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\]

Next, we substitute \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) into equation 1:
\\[ a^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{a} \\right)^{3/2} + b^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{b} \\right)^{3/2} + c^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{c} \\right)^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

\\[ (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) k^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

Using \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\) from equation 3:

\\[ k = p^3 \\]

Substituting \\(k = p^3\\) back into \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\):

","Okay, let's see. I need to express √a + √b + √c in terms of p, given these three equations. Hmm. Let me start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵
2. ax² = by² = cz²
3. 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p

Alright, so equation 2 says that ax², by², and cz² are all equal. Let me denote that common value as k. So, ax² = by² = cz² = k. Maybe I can solve for x, y, z in terms of k and a, b, c? Let's try:

From ax² = k, so x² = k/a, so x = √(k/a). Similarly, y = √(k/b) and z = √(k/c). But wait, x, y, z are variables here, so maybe I need to express them in terms of k and then substitute into the other equations. Hmm.

But equation 3 is 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. If I substitute x, y, z from above, then 1/x would be √(a/k), right? Because x = √(k/a), so 1/x = √(a/k). Similarly, 1/y = √(b/k), and 1/z = √(c/k). So equation 3 becomes:

√(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = 1/p

Which simplifies to (1/√k)(√a + √b + √c) = 1/p. Let me write that as:

(√a + √b + √c) / √k = 1/p

Then, multiplying both sides by √k:

√a + √b + √c = √k / p

But that's interesting because the left side is exactly what we need to express in terms of p. So if I can find √k in terms of p, then maybe I can relate it.

But how do I find √k? Let's see. From equation 2, we have ax² = by² = cz² = k. Maybe I can use equation 1, which involves a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Let me substitute x, y, z from equation 2 into equation 1.

Since x² = k/a, then x³ = x * x² = x * (k/a). But x is √(k/a). So x³ = √(k/a) * (k/a) = (k/a)^(3/2). Similarly, y³ = (k/b)^(3/2) and z³ = (k/c)^(3/2).

Therefore, equation 1 becomes:

a² * (k/a)^(3/2) + b² * (k/b)^(3/2) + c² * (k/c)^(3/2) = p⁵

Simplify each term:

First term: a² * (k/a)^(3/2) = a² * (k^(3/2) / a^(3/2)) ) = a^(2 - 3/2) * k^(3/2) = a^(1/2) * k^(3/2)

Similarly, the second term is b^(1/2) * k^(3/2), and the third term is c^(1/2) * k^(3/2).

So equation 1 simplifies to:

k^(3/2) ( √a + √b + √c ) = p⁵

But wait, from equation 3, we had √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Let me substitute that into equation 1.

So, equation 1 becomes:

k^(3/2) * (√k / p) = p⁵

Simplify left side:

k^(3/2) * √k = k^(3/2 + 1/2) = k^2

So:

k² / p = p⁵

Multiply both sides by p:

k² = p⁶

Therefore, k = p³ (since k is positive, assuming all variables are positive, which they probably are given the square roots and reciprocals)

So k = p³. Then, going back to equation 3:

√a + √b + √c = √k / p = √(p³)/p = (p^(3/2))/p = p^(1/2) = √p

Wait, that seems straightforward. So √a + √b + √c = √p. But let me check if I did everything correctly.

Let me go through the steps again.

Starting with equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k. So x = √(k/a), y = √(k/b), z = √(k/c). Then equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Which becomes √(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = 1/p. Factor out 1/√k: (√a + √b + √c)/√k = 1/p. Therefore, √a + √b + √c = √k / p.

Then equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Substitute x³ = (k/a)^(3/2) as above. So each term is a²*(k/a)^(3/2) = a^(2 - 3/2)k^(3/2) = a^(1/2)k^(3/2). Therefore, equation 1 becomes k^(3/2)(√a + √b + √c) = p⁵.

But from equation 3, we know √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Substitute that into equation 1: k^(3/2)*(√k / p) = p⁵. Then k^(3/2 + 1/2) = k². So k² / p = p⁵ => k² = p⁶ => k = p³. Then √a + √b + √c = √k / p = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p. So yes, that seems correct.

But let me check if there's any missing step or assumption. For example, are we assuming that a, b, c, x, y, z are positive? The problem mentions square roots and reciprocals, so likely yes. Also, when we take square roots, we take the positive roots. So the steps are valid.

Therefore, the answer should be √a + √b + √c = √p. So expressed in terms of p, it's √p. But let me check again with the equations.

Alternatively, maybe there's an error in substitution. Let me verify equation 1 substitution again.

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵.

x³ = (√(k/a))³ = (k/a)^(3/2). So a² * (k/a)^(3/2) = a² * (k^(3/2)/a^(3/2)) = a^(4/2 - 3/2) * k^(3/2) = a^(1/2)k^(3/2). Similarly for others. So sum is (√a + √b + √c) * k^(3/2) = p⁵.

Then, from equation 3, √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Substitute into equation 1: (√k / p) * k^(3/2) = p⁵. Then √k * k^(3/2) is k^(1/2 + 3/2) = k². So k² / p = p⁵ => k² = p⁶ => k = p³. Then √a + √b + √c = √p³ / p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p. So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is √p. So in boxed form, \\boxed{\\sqrt{p}}.

","Okay, so I have this problem here with three equations, and I need to express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm. Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right.

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵
2. ax² = by² = cz²
3. 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p

Alright, so the goal is to find √a + √b + √c using p. Let me see. Maybe I can find expressions for x, y, z in terms of a, b, c or something else? The second equation says that ax² = by² = cz². Let me denote this common value as some constant, maybe k. So, ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, x² = k/a, y² = k/b, z² = k/c. Therefore, x = √(k/a), y = √(k/b), z = √(k/c). But since we have square roots, maybe we need to consider positive roots? Probably, since variables are in denominators in the third equation, so x, y, z can't be zero. So, positive roots are okay.

Now, let's plug these expressions into the third equation: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. So substituting, we get:

1/√(k/a) + 1/√(k/b) + 1/√(k/c) = 1/p

Simplify each term: 1/√(k/a) = √(a/k), similarly for the others. So:

√(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = 1/p

Factor out 1/√k:

(√a + √b + √c)/√k = 1/p

Therefore, √a + √b + √c = √k / p

Hmm, so that's one relation. Let me note that down. So, √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Maybe I can find another equation involving √k and p?

Looking at the first equation: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Let's substitute x, y, z in terms of k and a, b, c. So x³ = (k/a)^(3/2), similarly for y³ and z³. Therefore, the first equation becomes:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = p⁵

Simplify each term:

a²*(k^(3/2)/a^(3/2)) = a^(1/2)*k^(3/2)

Similarly, b²*(k/b)^(3/2) = b^(1/2)*k^(3/2)

And c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = c^(1/2)*k^(3/2)

So the entire left-hand side is k^(3/2)*(√a + √b + √c) = p⁵

But from earlier, we have that √a + √b + √c = √k / p. So substituting that into this equation:

k^(3/2)*(√k / p) = p⁵

Simplify the left side: k^(3/2 + 1/2) = k². So, k² / p = p⁵

Therefore, k² = p⁶ => k = p³ (since k is a positive real number, as it's under square roots in previous steps)

Now, going back to the expression for √a + √b + √c: we had √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Since k = p³, then √k = p^(3/2). Therefore:

√a + √b + √c = p^(3/2) / p = p^(1/2) = √p

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if that's correct.

Let me recap:

1. From equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k, so x = √(k/a), etc.
2. Plugging into equation 3: sum of reciprocals equals 1/p, leading to (√a + √b + √c)/√k = 1/p => sum = √k / p
3. Plugging into equation 1: sum * k^(3/2) = p⁵, so k² / p = p⁵ => k² = p⁶ => k = p³
4. Therefore, sum = √k / p = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p

So the answer is √p. That seems too simple. Let me verify with substitution.

Suppose √a + √b + √c = √p. Let me check if that's consistent with all equations.

Given that, let's see if we can find a, b, c in terms of p. But maybe I can take specific values. Let me choose a = b = c. Then √a + √b + √c = 3√a = √p => √a = √p / 3 => a = p/(9). Then, from equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k. So x = √(k/a) = √(9k/p). Let's see if that works with equation 3.

1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. If a = b = c = p/9, then x = y = z = √(9k/p). Then 3/√(9k/p) = 1/p => 3/√(9k/p) = 1/p => √(9k/p) = 3p => 9k/p = 9p² => k = p³. Then, equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = 3*( (p/9)^2*(√(9p³/p))^3 ) = 3*( (p²/81)*(√(9p²))^3 ) = 3*( (p²/81)*(3p)^3 ) = 3*( (p²/81)*27p³ ) = 3*( (p² * 27p³)/81 ) = 3*( (27p^5)/81 ) = 3*(p^5/3) = p^5. Which matches equation 1. So in this case, when a = b = c = p/9, the equations hold and √a + √b + √c = 3√(p/9) = 3*(√p / 3) = √p. So that works.

Another test case: suppose a, b, c are different. Let me choose a, b, c such that √a + √b + √c = √p. Let me pick a = p/4, b = p/4, c = p/4. Then each √a = √(p/4) = √p / 2, so sum is 3√p / 2. That's not √p. So maybe my initial assumption of equality is wrong, but the problem doesn't state that a, b, c are equal. However, the equations must hold regardless of a, b, c. Wait, but in the problem, the equations are given, and we have to express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. So the answer is √p regardless of a, b, c? That seems odd. Wait, but in the equations, a, b, c are variables that satisfy the equations given x, y, z. So x, y, z are also variables. So the equations are a system of equations in a, b, c, x, y, z, and we need to find √a + √b + √c in terms of p.

But in the solution above, through substitution, we arrived at √a + √b + √c = √p, regardless of the specific values of a, b, c, as long as they satisfy the given equations. Let me check with another example.

Suppose p = 4. Then √p = 2. So according to the answer, √a + √b + √c = 2. Let's find such a, b, c and x, y, z that satisfy the equations.

Let me set a = 1, b = 1, c = 1. Then √a + √b + √c = 3, which is not 2. So this contradicts. Wait, so maybe my answer is wrong? Wait, but in the first test case when a = b = c = p/9, the equations hold. But in this case, when p = 4, a = 4/9, b = 4/9, c = 4/9. Then √a + √b + √c = 3*√(4/9) = 3*(2/3) = 2, which is √p. So that works. But if I choose a, b, c differently, like a = 1, but then the equations might not hold. So the key is that given the equations, the only possible value for √a + √b + √c is √p. So in other words, regardless of the specific a, b, c (as long as they satisfy the equations with some x, y, z), the sum √a + √b + √c must equal √p. So the answer is √p.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebra. Let me check again.

Starting from equation 3: (1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = 1/p. Then, with x = √(k/a), etc., we get (sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k)) = 1/p. Factor out 1/sqrt(k): (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(k) = 1/p. Then, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p.

From equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Substitute x³ = (k/a)^(3/2), same for y and z. Then, each term is a²*(k/a)^(3/2) = a^(1/2)*k^(3/2). So total sum is k^(3/2)*(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) = p⁵. But from above, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Substitute that in: k^(3/2)*(sqrt(k)/p) = p⁵. Then, k^(2) / p = p⁵ => k² = p⁶ => k = p³. Therefore, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = sqrt(p). So yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the answer is sqrt(p). So √a + √b + √c = √p. Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{\\sqrt{p}}.

","Okay, so I have this problem here with three equations and I need to find the value of √a + √b + √c in terms of p. Let me try to figure this out step by step. Hmm, the equations are:

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵
2. ax² = by² = cz²
3. 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p

Alright, so the goal is to express √a + √b + √c using p. Let me start by looking at the second equation because it seems like it relates a, b, c with x, y, z. Maybe I can express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c or vice versa.

The second equation says ax² = by² = cz². Let me denote this common value as k. So, ax² = k, by² = k, cz² = k. Therefore, x² = k/a, y² = k/b, z² = k/c. Taking square roots, we get x = √(k/a), y = √(k/b), z = √(k/c). Hmm, but square roots can be positive or negative, but maybe since we are dealing with variables under square roots in the first equation and in the third equation (which has reciprocals), we can assume x, y, z are positive. So, x = √(k/a), y = √(k/b), z = √(k/c). Let me write that down:

x = √(k/a) => x = √(k)/√a
Similarly,
y = √(k)/√b
z = √(k)/√c

Okay, so x, y, z are expressed in terms of k and a, b, c. Now, let's look at the third equation: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Let me substitute the expressions for x, y, z here.

1/x = √a / √k
1/y = √b / √k
1/z = √c / √k

So adding them up:

(√a + √b + √c) / √k = 1/p

Let me denote S = √a + √b + √c. Then the equation becomes:

S / √k = 1/p => S = √k / p

But we need to find S in terms of p, so maybe we need to find k in terms of p? Let's see.

Now, let's look at the first equation: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Let's substitute x, y, z from the expressions in terms of k and a, b, c.

First, compute x³:

x³ = (√(k/a))³ = (k/a)^(3/2) = k^(3/2) / a^(3/2)

Similarly,

y³ = k^(3/2) / b^(3/2)

z³ = k^(3/2) / c^(3/2)

Therefore, plugging into the first equation:

a² * (k^(3/2) / a^(3/2)) + b² * (k^(3/2) / b^(3/2)) + c² * (k^(3/2) / c^(3/2)) = p⁵

Simplify each term:

a² / a^(3/2) = a^(1/2) = √a

Similarly, b² / b^(3/2) = √b, and c² / c^(3/2) = √c

So the equation becomes:

√a * k^(3/2) + √b * k^(3/2) + √c * k^(3/2) = p⁵

Factor out k^(3/2):

(√a + √b + √c) * k^(3/2) = p⁵

But we already defined S = √a + √b + √c, so:

S * k^(3/2) = p⁵

Earlier, from the third equation, we had S = √k / p. Let me substitute that into this equation.

So replacing S:

(√k / p) * k^(3/2) = p⁵

Simplify the left side:

√k * k^(3/2) = k^(1/2 + 3/2) = k²

Therefore:

k² / p = p⁵

Multiply both sides by p:

k² = p⁶

Take square roots:

k = p³ (assuming k is positive, which seems reasonable here)

So k = p³. Now, substitute back into S = √k / p:

S = √(p³) / p = p^(3/2) / p = p^(1/2) = √p

Wait, is that possible? So √a + √b + √c = √p? That seems straightforward, but let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the beginning:

1. Expressed x, y, z in terms of k and a, b, c.

2. Substituted into the third equation to get S / √k = 1/p => S = √k / p.

3. Substituted x³, y³, z³ into the first equation, simplified to S * k^(3/2) = p⁵.

4. Replaced S with √k / p, leading to k² = p⁶, so k = p³.

5. Then S = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p.

Yes, that seems correct. Let me verify if all substitutions are valid.

In step 1, we set ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then solved for x, y, z. Then substituted into equation 3. Then into equation 1. Each substitution step seems okay. Also, when we took square roots, assuming positive values. Since the problem doesn't specify any constraints on a, b, c, x, y, z, but given that they are under square roots and reciprocals in equation 3, they must be positive. So all steps are valid.

Therefore, the answer should be √p. Let me just check if there's an alternative way to approach this, but I think this is the correct path. Maybe another way is to introduce variables like m = √a, n = √b, o = √c, then express a = m², b = n², c = o². Then, perhaps, but I think the current approach is sufficient. Alternatively, maybe setting t = √k, but that might complicate things. The steps seem solid. So, after careful consideration, I think the answer is √p.

3. \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

We need to express \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of \\(p\\).

First, we denote the common value of \\(ax^2\\), \\(by^2\\), and \\(cz^2\\) as \\(k\\). Thus, we have:
\\[ ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k \\]

From this, we can express \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) as:

This simplifies to:

Next, we substitute \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) into equation 1:

","Okay, let's see. I have these three equations, and I need to express the sum of the square roots of a, b, and c in terms of p. Hmm. Let me start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right.

1. $a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5$
2. $ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2$
3. $\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}$

Alright, so equation 2 says that ax², by², and cz² are all equal. Let me denote that common value as k. So, let me set:

$ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k$

This means I can express x, y, and z in terms of k and the variables a, b, c. Let's solve each equation for x, y, z.

From $ax^2 = k$, we get $x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}}$. Similarly, $y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{b}}$ and $z = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{c}}$.

Now, equation 3 is about the reciprocals of x, y, z adding up to 1/p. Let's substitute the expressions for x, y, z into equation 3.

So, $\\frac{1}{x} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{k}}$, $\\frac{1}{y} = \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{k}}$, $\\frac{1}{z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{k}}$. Therefore, equation 3 becomes:

$\\sqrt{\\frac{a}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{k}} = \\frac{1}{p}$

Factor out $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}}$:

$\\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p}$

Let me denote S = $\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}$. Then the equation becomes:

$ \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\Rightarrow S = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} $

So, if I can find k in terms of p, then I can express S in terms of p.

Now, let's look at equation 1. Substitute x, y, z into equation 1. From equation 1:

$a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5$

We can substitute x, y, z using the expressions from equation 2. Let's compute each term.

First, x³:

$x^3 = \\left( \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}} \\right)^3 = \\frac{k^{3/2}}{a^{3/2}}$

Similarly, y³ = $\\frac{k^{3/2}}{b^{3/2}}$, z³ = $\\frac{k^{3/2}}{c^{3/2}}$

Therefore, equation 1 becomes:

$a^2 \\cdot \\frac{k^{3/2}}{a^{3/2}} + b^2 \\cdot \\frac{k^{3/2}}{b^{3/2}} + c^2 \\cdot \\frac{k^{3/2}}{c^{3/2}} = p^5$

Simplify each term:

For the first term: $a^{2 - 3/2}k^{3/2} = a^{1/2}k^{3/2}$

Similarly, the second term: $b^{1/2}k^{3/2}$, third term: $c^{1/2}k^{3/2}$

So, combining them:

$a^{1/2}k^{3/2} + b^{1/2}k^{3/2} + c^{1/2}k^{3/2} = p^5$

Factor out $k^{3/2}$:

$k^{3/2}(a^{1/2} + b^{1/2} + c^{1/2}) = p^5$

But notice that $a^{1/2} + b^{1/2} + c^{1/2}$ is exactly S, the sum we want. So:

$k^{3/2} \\cdot S = p^5$

But from equation 3, we have S = $\\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}$. Let's substitute that into this equation.

Substitute S into equation 1's result:

$k^{3/2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} = p^5$

Simplify the left side:

$k^{3/2} \\cdot k^{1/2} = k^{(3/2 + 1/2)} = k^2$

Therefore, $k^2 / p = p^5 \\Rightarrow k^2 = p^6 \\Rightarrow k = p^3$

Since k is a square (from x, y, z expressions) and p is presumably positive (since we have 1/p in equation 3), so k = p³.

Now, substitute k = p³ back into S = $\\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}$:

S = $\\frac{\\sqrt{p^3}}{p} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{p} = p^{1/2} = \\sqrt{p}$

Wait, but the problem says to express $\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}$ in terms of p, which is S. So according to this, S = $\\sqrt{p}$. But the answer is supposed to be boxed, and the user mentioned ""the answer is 2/3"" but maybe that's a typo? Wait, no, the user's message says ""Express sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) in terms of p. 2/3"". Wait, maybe the user intended the answer to be 2p^(2/3) or something? Wait, let me check my steps again.

Wait, let me verify step by step.

First, from equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c).

Equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Substituting x, y, z gives sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p. Factor out 1/sqrt(k): (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(k) = 1/p. Therefore, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p = S.

Then equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p^5. Substitute x³, y³, z³:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = p^5

Simplify each term:

a²*(k^{3/2}/a^{3/2}) = a^{2 - 3/2}k^{3/2} = a^{1/2}k^{3/2}

Similarly for others. So total is (a^{1/2} + b^{1/2} + c^{1/2})k^{3/2} = S * k^{3/2}

But S = sqrt(k)/p, so substituting into equation 1: sqrt(k)/p * k^{3/2} = k^{2}/p = p^5. Therefore, k² = p^6 => k = p³.

Then S = sqrt(k)/p = sqrt(p³)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So S = sqrt(p). So answer is sqrt(p). But the user wrote ""the answer is 2/3"" at the end, maybe a mistake? Or maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me check again. Maybe there is a miscalculation in the exponents.

Let me check equation 1 substitution again.

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p^5

x³ = (k/a)^{3/2}, so a²*(k/a)^{3/2} = a² * k^{3/2}/a^{3/2} = a^{2 - 3/2}k^{3/2} = a^{1/2}k^{3/2}

Same for others. So sum is k^{3/2}(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) = p^5

But S = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p, so substituting:

k^{3/2}*(sqrt(k)/p) = k^{2}/p = p^5

Therefore, k² = p^6 => k = p^3

Then S = sqrt(k)/p = sqrt(p³)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So S = sqrt(p). So the answer should be sqrt(p). But the user says ""the answer is 2/3"" perhaps they had a different problem? Wait, but according to this, the answer is sqrt(p). Let me see if there's an error.

Wait, maybe in the substitution steps. Let me check equation 3 again.

Equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. x = sqrt(k/a), so 1/x = sqrt(a/k). Similarly for others. So sum is sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p. Factor out 1/sqrt(k): (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(k) = 1/p. So S = sqrt(k)/p. Correct.

Then equation 1: sum of a²x³ etc. Which becomes S * k^{3/2} = p^5. Then substituting S = sqrt(k)/p, gives k^{3/2} * sqrt(k)/p = k^2 / p = p^5. So k^2 = p^6, so k = p^3. Then S = sqrt(p^3)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So yes, answer is sqrt(p). Maybe the user made a typo. But according to the equations, the answer is sqrt(p). Let me check with another approach.

Alternative approach: Let me set t = sqrt(a), u = sqrt(b), v = sqrt(c). Then a = t², b = u², c = v². Then equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k. So t²x² = u²y² = v²z² = k. Therefore, x = sqrt(k)/t, y = sqrt(k)/u, z = sqrt(k)/v.

Then equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = t/sqrt(k) + u/sqrt(k) + v/sqrt(k) = (t + u + v)/sqrt(k) = 1/p. Therefore, t + u + v = sqrt(k)/p. Which is S = sqrt(k)/p. So same as before.

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = t^4 x³ + u^4 y³ + v^4 z³ = p^5.

Substitute x, y, z:

t^4*(sqrt(k)/t)^3 + u^4*(sqrt(k)/u)^3 + v^4*(sqrt(k)/v)^3 = t^4*(k^{3/2}/t^3) + u^4*(k^{3/2}/u^3) + v^4*(k^{3/2}/v^3) = t k^{3/2} + u k^{3/2} + v k^{3/2} = k^{3/2}(t + u + v) = k^{3/2} S.

But from equation 3, S = sqrt(k)/p. Therefore, k^{3/2} * sqrt(k)/p = k^{2}/p = p^5. So k² = p^6, so k = p^3. Then S = sqrt(p^3)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So same result. So answer is sqrt(p). So perhaps the user made a mistake in stating the problem, or maybe there's a different interpretation.

Wait, but the user's problem statement says ""Express sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) in terms of p. 2/3"". Maybe the answer is 2/3 * p^(something)? Or maybe the user is confused.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation. Let me check once again.

Wait, in the step where I substitute S into equation 1: S * k^{3/2} = p^5. Then S = sqrt(k)/p. Therefore, (sqrt(k)/p) * k^{3/2} = k^{2}/p = p^5. So k² = p^6, so k = p³. Then S = sqrt(p³)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So yes, sqrt(p). So unless there's a miscalculation here, the answer should be sqrt(p). Therefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\sqrt{p}}.

But the user initially wrote ""the answer is 2/3"" at the end, but that might be a mistake or a different problem. However, based on the given equations, the correct answer is sqrt(p). So I think that's the solution.

\\[ \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\]

Next, we substitute \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) into equation 1:
\\[ a^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{a} \\right)^{3/2} + b^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{b} \\right)^{3/2} + c^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{c} \\right)^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

Simplifying each term:

\\[ (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) k^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

Using \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\) from equation 3:

\\[ \\frac{k^2}{p} = p^5 \\]
\\[ k^2 = p^6 \\]
\\[ k = p^3 \\]

","Alright, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. So, we have three equations here, and we need to find an expression for √a + √b + √c in terms of p. Hmm, okay. Let's start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them all straight.

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵
2. ax² = by² = cz²
3. (1/x) + (1/y) + (1/z) = 1/p

Our goal is to express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. Hmm. Alright, let's see. Maybe I can find relationships between a, b, c, x, y, z first. The second equation says that ax², by², and cz² are all equal. Let's denote that common value as k. So, ax² = by² = cz² = k. That might help us express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c, and k.

From ax² = k, we can solve for x: x = √(k/a). Similarly, y = √(k/b) and z = √(k/c). Okay, so x, y, z are expressed in terms of k and a, b, c. Maybe we can use these expressions in the third equation. Let's try that.

The third equation is (1/x) + (1/y) + (1/z) = 1/p. Substituting the expressions for x, y, z gives us:

1/√(k/a) + 1/√(k/b) + 1/√(k/c) = 1/p.

Simplifying each term, that's √(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = 1/p. Factor out 1/√k:

(√a + √b + √c)/√k = 1/p.

Hmm, so that gives us √a + √b + √c = √k / p. That's interesting. So if we can find √k in terms of p, then we can express the sum we need in terms of p. Let's note that.

Now, moving to the first equation: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Let's substitute x, y, z from earlier expressions. Recall x = √(k/a), so x³ = (k/a)^(3/2). Similarly for y³ and z³. Let's compute each term:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) = a² * k^(3/2) / a^(3/2) = a^(1/2) * k^(3/2).

Similarly, b²*(k/b)^(3/2) = b^(1/2) * k^(3/2), and c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = c^(1/2) * k^(3/2).

So the first equation becomes:

a^(1/2) * k^(3/2) + b^(1/2) * k^(3/2) + c^(1/2) * k^(3/2) = p⁵.

Factor out k^(3/2):

k^(3/2) * (√a + √b + √c) = p⁵.

But from earlier, we have √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Let's substitute that into this equation:

k^(3/2) * (√k / p) = p⁵.

Simplify the left side:

k^(3/2 + 1/2) / p = p⁵ → k² / p = p⁵.

Multiply both sides by p:

k² = p⁶ → k = p³ (since k is a squared term, so positive).

Now that we have k = p³, let's go back to the expression we had earlier for √a + √b + √c. It was √k / p, which becomes √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p. Wait, is that right? Let's check:

√k = √(p³) = p^(3/2), so √k / p = p^(3/2 - 1) = p^(1/2) = √p. So yes, √a + √b + √c = √p. That seems straightforward, but let me verify if there are any steps I might have missed or made a mistake in.

Wait, let's recap the steps to make sure:

1. Let k = ax² = by² = cz². Expressed x, y, z in terms of k and a, b, c.
2. Substituted into equation 3, leading to (√a + √b + √c)/√k = 1/p, so sum = √k / p.
3. Substituted x, y, z into equation 1, leading to k^(3/2)*(sum) = p⁵.
4. Substituted sum from step 2 into equation 1, solved for k, found k = p³.
5. Plugged k back into sum expression to get √p.

Hmm, seems correct. Let me check if there's a possibility that k could be negative. However, since x, y, z are in denominators in equation 3, they can't be zero, and since they're squared in ax², by², cz², k must be positive. So k = p³ is positive, so that's okay.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's see if we can relate a, b, c directly. Suppose we let ax² = by² = cz² = k, then a = k/x², b = k/y², c = k/z². Then √a = √(k)/x, √b = √(k)/y, √c = √(k)/z. Therefore, √a + √b + √c = √k (1/x + 1/y + 1/z). But from equation 3, 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Therefore, √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Which is the same result as before. Then, using equation 1, we can relate k to p, leading to k = p³. Hence, the sum is √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2). So same answer.

Therefore, the answer should be √p. Let me check if that's the case. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me verify the steps again.

Wait, in the first equation substitution:

a²x³ = (k/x²)^2 * x³ = k²/x⁴ * x³ = k²/x. Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recalculate that.

Wait, if a = k/x², then a² = k²/x⁴. Then a²x³ = (k²/x⁴) * x³ = k²/x. Similarly for the other terms. So then equation 1 becomes:

k²/x + k²/y + k²/z = p⁵.

Which factors to k² (1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = p⁵.

But from equation 3, 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Therefore:

k² * (1/p) = p⁵ → k² = p⁶ → k = p³. Same as before.

Then, since √a + √b + √c = √k / p = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2). So yes, that's correct. Therefore, the answer is √p. Wait, but the problem says ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. 2/3."" Wait, the original problem statement might have a typo? Let me check again.

The user wrote:

""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. 2/3""

But maybe ""2/3"" was part of the problem statement? Wait, looking back:

""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p.\\frac{2}{3}""

Wait, perhaps the problem was supposed to be in LaTeX, and the user made a typo. Maybe it's supposed to be ""in terms of p^{2/3}""? Or maybe the answer is p^{2/3}? Wait, but according to our derivation, the answer is √p, which is p^{1/2}. But maybe there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, let's check the substitution again.

From equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. We have √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Then equation 1 gives k² / p = p⁵, so k² = p⁶, so k = p³. Then √k = p^{3/2}, so √k / p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = √p. So yes, √p. But the user wrote ""2/3"" at the end. Maybe they meant to say ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p^{2/3}""? Or maybe it's a different question. Wait, perhaps I misread the original problem.

Wait, the user wrote:

""Given the equations:

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵

2. ax² = by² = cz²

3. (1/x) + (1/y) + (1/z) = (1/p)

Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p.\\frac{2}{3}""

Wait, maybe the last part is supposed to be a fraction? Like, ""in terms of p^{2/3}""? Because otherwise, the "".\\frac{2}{3}"" is confusing. Maybe the problem was mistyped, and the answer is p^{2/3}? Let me check again.

Wait, let's see. If we follow the steps, we get √p, which is p^{1/2}. But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.

Wait, in the third equation, substituting x, y, z:

1/x = √(a/k), 1/y = √(b/k), 1/z = √(c/k). Therefore, 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = √(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = (√a + √b + √c)/√k = 1/p. Therefore, √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Then, equation 1:

a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵.

Expressed in terms of k:

(k²/x⁴) * x³ + (k²/y⁴) * y³ + (k²/z⁴) * z³ = p⁵.

Which simplifies to k²/x + k²/y + k²/z = p⁵.

Factor out k²:

k²(1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = p⁵.

But 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p, so k²(1/p) = p⁵ → k² = p⁶ → k = p³. Therefore, √k = p^{3/2}, so √a + √b + √c = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2}. So √p. Hmm. So unless there's an error in the problem statement, the answer should be √p. But the user wrote "".\\frac{2}{3}"" at the end, which might be a typo. Alternatively, maybe the problem is to express the sum in terms of p^{2/3}?

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation in the exponents. Let me check again.

From equation 3: √a + √b + √c = √k / p.

From equation 1: k² / p = p⁵ → k² = p⁶ → k = p³.

Therefore, √k = p^{3/2}, so √k / p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = √p.

Yes, that's correct. So unless the problem statement has a typo, the answer should be √p. However, the user included "".\\frac{2}{3}"" at the end, which might be confusing. Maybe they meant to write ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p^{2/3}"". But according to the steps, the answer is √p. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach where the answer is p^{2/3}. Let me check again.

Wait, let's think differently. Suppose we let t = √a + √b + √c. Maybe we can find t in terms of p.

From equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k. Let me denote ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, as before, x = √(k/a), y = √(k/b), z = √(k/c).

Then equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = √(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = t / √k = 1/p. Therefore, t = √k / p.

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵.

Expressed in terms of k:

a²*(k/a)^{3/2} + b²*(k/b)^{3/2} + c²*(k/c)^{3/2} = p⁵.

Which simplifies to:

a^{1/2}k^{3/2} + b^{1/2}k^{3/2} + c^{1/2}k^{3/2} = p⁵.

Factor out k^{3/2}:

k^{3/2}(√a + √b + √c) = p⁵.

But we know that √a + √b + √c = t = √k / p. Substitute into equation 1:

k^{3/2}*(√k / p) = p⁵.

Simplify the left side:

k^{(3/2 + 1/2)} / p = k² / p = p⁵.

Multiply both sides by p:

k² = p⁶ → k = p³.

Therefore, t = √k / p = √(p³)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = √p.

So yes, regardless of the approach, it seems like the answer is √p. The "".\\frac{2}{3}"" at the end might be a typo or part of the problem statement that's unclear. If the problem is indeed asking for the expression in terms of p^{2/3}, then perhaps there's an error in the problem setup or my solution. But according to the given equations, the answer should be √p. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation here, I think the correct answer is √p. Maybe the user mistyped the exponent? Or perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Alternatively, let's suppose that the equations are different. Let me check again:

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵.

Equation 2: ax² = by² = cz².

Equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p.

Yes, that's correct. So with these equations, the answer is √p. Maybe the user wanted 2/3 in the exponent, but according to the calculations, it's 1/2. Perhaps the answer is p^{2/3}, but that would require different steps. Let me see if there's a way to get p^{2/3}.

Wait, let's suppose that in equation 3, instead of 1/p, it's p^{2/3}, but no, the problem states 1/p. Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let's try to express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c, and then relate them.

From equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k. So x = √(k/a), y = √(k/b), z = √(k/c). Then, equation 3 becomes:

1/√(k/a) + 1/√(k/b) + 1/√(k/c) = 1/p.

Which is √(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = 1/p.

Factor out 1/√k:

(√a + √b + √c)/√k = 1/p → √a + √b + √c = √k / p.

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵.

Substitute x, y, z:

a²*(k/a)^{3/2} + b²*(k/b)^{3/2} + c²*(k/c)^{3/2} = p⁵.

Simplify each term:

a²*(k^{3/2}/a^{3/2}) = a^{1/2}k^{3/2}, similarly for the others.

Thus, k^{3/2}(√a + √b + √c) = p⁵.

But from equation 3, √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Substitute:

k^{3/2}*(√k / p) = p⁵ → k^{2} / p = p⁵ → k² = p⁶ → k = p³.

Therefore, √a + √b + √c = √(p³)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = √p.

Same result. Therefore, unless the problem statement is incorrect, the answer should be √p. The "".\\frac{2}{3}"" at the end might be a formatting error or a typo. If the problem indeed expects the answer in terms of p^{2/3}, then there might be an error in the problem setup or the solution. But given the equations as stated, √p is the correct answer.

","Okay, so I need to find an expression for √a + √b + √c in terms of p, given these three equations. Let me start by writing down the equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵
2. ax² = by² = cz²
3. 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p

Hmm, equation 2 says that ax², by², and cz² are all equal. Maybe I can set them equal to some common value. Let's call that common value k. So, ax² = k, by² = k, cz² = k. Then, solving for x, y, z in terms of a, b, c, and k. Let's see:

From ax² = k, x = √(k/a)
Similarly, y = √(k/b), z = √(k/c)

But then, maybe I can substitute these expressions into equation 3 to solve for k in terms of a, b, c, and p?

Equation 3 is 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Let's substitute x, y, z:

1/√(k/a) + 1/√(k/b) + 1/√(k/c) = 1/p

Simplifying each term:

√(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = 1/p

Factor out 1/√k:

(√a + √b + √c)/√k = 1/p

So, √a + √b + √c = √k / p

Interesting. So if I can find √k in terms of p, then I can get the desired expression. Let's note that as equation 4:

4. √a + √b + √c = √k / p

Now, let's look at equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵

Again, substitute x, y, z from equation 2. Since x = √(k/a), x³ = (k/a)^(3/2). Similarly for y³ and z³.

So, substituting into equation 1:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = p⁵

Let me compute each term:

First term: a²*(k^(3/2)/a^(3/2)) = a^(2 - 3/2)*k^(3/2) = a^(1/2)*k^(3/2) = √a * (√k)^3

Similarly, second term: √b * (√k)^3

Third term: √c * (√k)^3

Therefore, equation 1 becomes:

(√a + √b + √c)*(√k)^3 = p⁵

But from equation 4, we already have √a + √b + √c = √k / p. So substitute that into equation 1:

(√k / p) * (√k)^3 = p⁵

Simplify the left side:

(√k / p) * k^(3/2) = (k^(1/2) * k^(3/2)) / p = k^(2) / p

So, k² / p = p⁵

Multiply both sides by p:

k² = p⁶

Therefore, k = p³ (since k is positive, as it's under a square root in the expressions for x, y, z)

Now, substitute k = p³ back into equation 4:

√a + √b + √c = √(p³) / p = p^(3/2) / p = p^(1/2) = √p

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check that again.

From equation 4: √a + √b + √c = √k / p

We found k² = p⁶, so k = p³. Then √k = √(p³) = p^(3/2). Therefore, √a + √b + √c = p^(3/2) / p = p^(1/2) = √p.

So, is the answer just √p? Let me verify with another approach to be sure.

Alternatively, let's consider variables substitution. Let me set √a = A, √b = B, √c = C. Then, the expression we need is A + B + C. Let's see if we can express A, B, C in terms of p.

From equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k. Let me write x² = k/a, so x = √(k/a). Similarly, y = √(k/b), z = √(k/c). Then equation 3 becomes 1/√(k/a) + 1/√(k/b) + 1/√(k/c) = 1/p. Which simplifies to √(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = 1/p. Factor out 1/√k: (√a + √b + √c)/√k = 1/p, so A + B + C = √k / p.

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Substitute x³ = (k/a)^(3/2), so a²*(k³/a³)^(1/2) = a²*(k^(3/2)/a^(3/2)) = (a^(2 - 3/2)) * k^(3/2) = a^(1/2) * k^(3/2) = A * (√k)^3.

Similarly, the other terms are B*(√k)^3 and C*(√k)^3. So equation 1 is (A + B + C)*(√k)^3 = p⁵. But from equation 3 substitution, we have A + B + C = √k / p. Substitute into equation 1:

(√k / p) * (√k)^3 = p⁵

Which simplifies to (√k * (√k)^3) / p = p⁵ → (k²)/p = p⁵ → k² = p⁶ → k = p³.

Then, A + B + C = √k / p = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p.

So, either way, the answer is √p. But let me check if there's any step I missed or any possible mistake in the algebra.

Wait, the problem statement mentions expressing √a + √b + √c in terms of p. So according to my calculations, it's √p. But let me check if the equations are satisfied with this result.

Suppose √a + √b + √c = √p. Let me see if this makes sense with the original equations.

From equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k = p³. Then, x = √(p³/a), y = √(p³/b), z = √(p³/c). Then equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = √a/p^(3/2) + √b/p^(3/2) + √c/p^(3/2) = (√a + √b + √c)/p^(3/2) = √p / p^(3/2) = p^(1/2)/p^(3/2) = 1/p. Which matches equation 3. Good.

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³. Let's compute each term:

x³ = (p³/a)^(3/2) = p^(9/2)/a^(3/2), so a²x³ = a² * p^(9/2)/a^(3/2) = a^(1/2) * p^(9/2) = √a * p^(9/2). Similarly for the other terms. So total sum: √a * p^(9/2) + √b * p^(9/2) + √c * p^(9/2) = p^(9/2)(√a + √b + √c) = p^(9/2) * √p = p^(9/2 + 1/2) = p^5. Which matches equation 1. Perfect.

Therefore, all equations are satisfied with √a + √b + √c = √p. So the answer should be √p, which is p^(1/2). The problem says to express it in terms of p, so √p is the correct answer. 

But wait, the problem says ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p."" So the answer is √p. But let me check again the steps because sometimes when dealing with square roots and exponents, there might be a miscalculation.

Wait, when we found that k = p³, then √k = √(p³) = p^(3/2). Then √a + √b + √c = √k / p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to express it using exponents. But √p is the same as p^(1/2), so either form is acceptable, but since the problem asks to express it in terms of p, writing √p is appropriate.

Therefore, the final answer should be √p, which in boxed form is \\boxed{\\sqrt{p}}.

Given the equations:

1. \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\)
2. \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2\\)
3. \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

We need to express \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of \\(p\\).

First, we denote the common value of \\(ax^2\\), \\(by^2\\), and \\(cz^2\\) as \\(k\\). Thus, we have:
\\[ ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k \\]

From this, we can express \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) as:
\\[ x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}}, \\quad y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{b}}, \\quad z = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{c}} \\]

Substituting these into equation 3:
\\[ \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\]

This simplifies to:
\\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\]
\\[ \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\]

Next, we substitute \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) into equation 1:
\\[ a^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{a} \\right)^{3/2} + b^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{b} \\right)^{3/2} + c^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{c} \\right)^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

Simplifying each term:
\\[ a^{1/2} k^{3/2} + b^{1/2} k^{3/2} + c^{1/2} k^{3/2} = p^5 \\]
\\[ (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) k^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

Using \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\) from equation 3:
\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\right) k^{3/2} = p^5 \\]
\\[ \\frac{k^2}{p} = p^5 \\]
\\[ k^2 = p^6 \\]
\\[ k = p^3 \\]

Substituting \\(k = p^3\\) back into \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\):
\\[ \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{p^3}}{p} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{p} = p^{1/2} = \\sqrt{p} \\]

Thus, the expression for \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of \\(p\\) is:
\\[ \\boxed{\\sqrt{p}} \\]

","Okay, so I need to express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. Let's see, there are three equations given. Let me list them again to make sure I have them right.

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵
2. ax² = by² = cz²
3. 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p

Hmm. Alright, equation 2 says that ax², by², and cz² are all equal. Let me denote this common value as k. So, ax² = by² = cz² = k. That might be helpful. Then, from each of these, I can express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c, and k.

For example, x² = k/a ⇒ x = sqrt(k/a). Similarly, y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c). But since we have square roots, maybe we need to consider positive roots? The problem doesn't specify if a, b, c, x, y, z, p are positive or not. Hmm. Well, maybe assuming they are positive to avoid dealing with multiple cases. So, x = √(k/a), y = √(k/b), z = √(k/c).

Then, equation 3 is 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Substituting the expressions for x, y, z, we get:

1/√(k/a) + 1/√(k/b) + 1/√(k/c) = 1/p

Simplify each term:

1/√(k/a) = sqrt(a/k), right? Because 1/√(k/a) = sqrt(a/k). Similarly for the others. So:

sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p

Factor out sqrt(1/k):

sqrt(1/k)(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) = 1/p

Let me write that as:

( sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) ) / sqrt(k) = 1/p

So, multiplying both sides by sqrt(k):

sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p

Hmm, okay. So that gives us sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) in terms of sqrt(k) and p. But we need to express this in terms of p only. So, we need to find what k is in terms of p.

But where does k come into play? Let's look at equation 1. Equation 1 is a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Again, substituting x, y, z from earlier:

x³ = (k/a)^(3/2), y³ = (k/b)^(3/2), z³ = (k/c)^(3/2). Let me verify that. Since x = sqrt(k/a), then x³ = (k/a)^(3/2). Similarly for the others.

So, substituting into equation 1:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = p⁵

Simplify each term:

For the first term: a²*(k³/a^(3/2)) = a^(2 - 3/2)*k^(3/2) = a^(1/2)*k^(3/2)

Similarly, the second term: b²*(k³/b^(3/2)) = b^(1/2)*k^(3/2)

Third term: c^(1/2)*k^(3/2)

So, the left-hand side becomes:

(a^(1/2) + b^(1/2) + c^(1/2)) * k^(3/2) = p⁵

But from equation 3, we already have that sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Let me denote S = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c). Then, S = sqrt(k)/p ⇒ sqrt(k) = S p. Therefore, k^(3/2) = (S p)^(3/2) = S^(3/2) p^(3/2)

So, substituting back into equation 1 expression:

S * k^(3/2) = S * S^(3/2) p^(3/2) = S^(5/2) p^(3/2) = p⁵

Therefore:

S^(5/2) p^(3/2) = p⁵

Divide both sides by p^(3/2):

S^(5/2) = p^(5/2)

Taking both sides to the power of 2/5:

S = p^( (5/2)*(2/5) ) = p^1 = p

Wait, so S = p. But S is sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c). Therefore, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = p.

Wait, but let me check that again. Let's go through the steps again to make sure.

Starting from equation 1:

After substitution, we have:

(a^(1/2) + b^(1/2) + c^(1/2)) * k^(3/2) = p⁵

But from equation 3, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Let's denote S = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c). Then S = sqrt(k)/p ⇒ sqrt(k) = S p ⇒ k = (S p)^2

Therefore, k^(3/2) = (S p)^(3/2) = S^(3/2) p^(3/2)

Substituting back into equation 1:

S * S^(3/2) p^(3/2) = S^(5/2) p^(3/2) = p⁵

Therefore, S^(5/2) p^(3/2) = p⁵

Divide both sides by p^(3/2):

S^(5/2) = p^(5/2)

Take both sides to the power of 2/5:

S = p^( (5/2)*(2/5) ) = p^1 = p

So yes, S = p. Therefore, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = p.

But wait, that seems straightforward. But let me check if there's any missing steps or possible errors.

Wait, so from equation 3, we have sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Then from equation 1, after substitution and simplification, we get S^(5/2) p^(3/2) = p⁵, leading to S = p.

Therefore, the answer is p. But let me check if this makes sense in terms of dimensions or units. If all the variables are dimensionless, then it's okay. Alternatively, if they have some units, but the equations are consistent, then it's fine.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the substitution steps. Let me retrace.

Starting with equations 2 and 3. Let me denote the common value of ax², by², cz² as k. So ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c). Then equation 3 becomes:

1/sqrt(k/a) + 1/sqrt(k/b) + 1/sqrt(k/c) = 1/p

Which simplifies to sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p, which is equivalent to (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(k) = 1/p, so sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Let's denote S = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. So sqrt(k) = S p. Then k = S² p².

Now, equation 1 is a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Substitute x³, y³, z³:

x³ = (k/a)^(3/2), so a²x³ = a²*(k/a)^(3/2) = a²*(k^(3/2)/a^(3/2)) = a^(2 - 3/2) k^(3/2) = a^(1/2) k^(3/2)

Similarly for the other terms. So equation 1 becomes:

(a^(1/2) + b^(1/2) + c^(1/2)) * k^(3/2) = p⁵

But a^(1/2) + b^(1/2) + c^(1/2) = S, and k^(3/2) = (S² p²)^(3/2) = S³ p³. Therefore, equation 1 becomes:

S * S³ p³ = S⁴ p³ = p⁵

Divide both sides by p³:

S⁴ = p²

Take square roots:

S² = p

Then S = sqrt(p). Wait, hold on! Wait, that contradicts the previous conclusion. Wait, what's happening here?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substitution. Let me check again.

Wait, if equation 1 after substitution is S * k^(3/2) = p⁵, and k = S² p², then k^(3/2) = (S² p²)^(3/2) = S³ p³. Therefore, equation 1 becomes S * S³ p³ = S⁴ p³ = p⁵. Therefore, S⁴ p³ = p⁵ ⇒ S⁴ = p² ⇒ S² = p ⇒ S = sqrt(p). But earlier, from equation 3, we had S = sqrt(k)/p. But if S = sqrt(k)/p and k = S² p², then sqrt(k) = S p. So substituting back, S = (S p)/p ⇒ S = S. Which is consistent, but doesn't help.

Wait, so according to equation 1, S⁴ = p² ⇒ S² = p ⇒ S = sqrt(p). But according to equation 3, S = sqrt(k)/p, and k = S² p². So S = sqrt(S² p²)/p = (S p)/p = S. So that's consistent but doesn't resolve the value of S. So we have S = sqrt(p) from equation 1, but also S = sqrt(k)/p. Then sqrt(k) = S p = sqrt(p) * p = p^(3/2). Therefore, k = (p^(3/2))² = p³.

But from equation 3, we had k = S² p². If S = sqrt(p), then k = (sqrt(p))² * p² = p * p² = p³. Which matches. So that's consistent.

But then, from equation 3, S = sqrt(k)/p = sqrt(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = sqrt(p). But earlier, from equation 1, we had S = sqrt(p). So that's consistent. Therefore, S = sqrt(p). But wait, earlier when I thought S = p, that was wrong. So I must have made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let's see:

From equation 3:

S = sqrt(k)/p. Then sqrt(k) = S p.

From equation 1:

S * k^(3/2) = p⁵. Substitute k^(3/2) = (S p)^(3/2) = S^(3/2) p^(3/2). Therefore:

S * S^(3/2) p^(3/2) = S^(5/2) p^(3/2) = p⁵

Therefore:

S^(5/2) = p^(5/2)

Then taking both sides to the power 2/5:

S = p^( (5/2)*(2/5) ) = p^1 = p

Wait, but earlier when I checked via substitution, I thought S = sqrt(p). So there is a contradiction here. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps my mistake is in the substitution steps. Let's do this again carefully.

Let me denote S = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c). From equation 3, S = sqrt(k)/p. Therefore, sqrt(k) = S p. Therefore, k = (S p)^2.

From equation 1:

After substitution, we have S * k^(3/2) = p⁵. Substitute k = (S p)^2:

k^(3/2) = [(S p)^2]^(3/2) = (S p)^3.

Therefore, equation 1 becomes S * (S p)^3 = S * S³ p³ = S⁴ p³ = p⁵.

Therefore, S⁴ p³ = p⁵ ⇒ S⁴ = p² ⇒ S² = p ⇒ S = sqrt(p). So here, S is sqrt(p). But earlier, when I manipulated the exponents, I thought S = p. Which is correct?

Wait, this is conflicting. Let me check step by step.

Starting from equation 1 substitution:

Original equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵

Expressed in terms of k and S:

Each term is (sqrt(a) * k^(3/2)), sum to p⁵.

But S * k^(3/2) = p⁵. Wait, no, actually each term is a^(1/2) * k^(3/2), so total is (a^(1/2) + b^(1/2) + c^(1/2)) * k^(3/2) = S * k^(3/2) = p⁵.

But from equation 3, S = sqrt(k)/p. Therefore, sqrt(k) = S p. Then k = (S p)^2. Therefore, k^(3/2) = (S p)^3. Therefore, equation 1 becomes S*(S p)^3 = S^4 p^3 = p^5. Therefore, S^4 p^3 = p^5 ⇒ S^4 = p^2 ⇒ S^2 = p ⇒ S = sqrt(p).

But earlier, when I thought S = p, that was incorrect. So where did that mistake come from?

Let me retrace. When I had S^(5/2) p^(3/2) = p^5, then dividing both sides by p^(3/2) gives S^(5/2) = p^(5/2), leading to S = p. But that was wrong. Wait, why?

Wait, S^(5/2) = p^(5/2) ⇒ both sides are raised to the power 2/5: S = p. But how?

Wait, S^(5/2) = p^(5/2) ⇒ take both sides to the power 2/5: (S^(5/2))^{2/5} = (p^(5/2))^{2/5} ⇒ S^{(5/2)*(2/5)} = p^{(5/2)*(2/5)} ⇒ S^1 = p^1 ⇒ S = p.

But according to the substitution step, S = sqrt(p). So there's a conflict here. Therefore, one of the steps must be wrong.

Wait, this is confusing. Let's check with actual numbers. Suppose p = 4. Then according to S = p, S = 4. According to S = sqrt(p), S = 2. Which one is correct?

Let me try to assign numbers.

Assume p = 4.

From equation 3, S = sqrt(k)/4.

From equation 1, S * k^(3/2) = 4^5 = 1024.

If S = 4, then 4 * k^(3/2) = 1024 ⇒ k^(3/2) = 256 ⇒ k = 256^(2/3) = (256^(1/3))^2. 256 is 2^8, so 256^(1/3) = 2^(8/3) ≈ 6.3496, squared is ≈ 40.317. Then S = sqrt(k)/4 ≈ sqrt(40.317)/4 ≈ 6.3496/4 ≈ 1.5874, which is not 4. So contradiction.

If S = sqrt(p) = 2, then from equation 3, sqrt(k) = S * p = 2 * 4 = 8 ⇒ k = 64. Then equation 1: S * k^(3/2) = 2 * (64)^(3/2) = 2 * 256 = 512. But p^5 = 4^5 = 1024. 512 ≠ 1024. Contradiction.

Wait, so both approaches lead to contradictions. That means there must be an error in the process.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in substituting k into equation 1.

Let me try again.

Given:

From equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k.

Therefore, x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c).

Equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p ⇒ sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p ⇒ (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(k) = 1/p ⇒ sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Let S = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p ⇒ sqrt(k) = S p ⇒ k = S² p².

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Substitute x³, y³, z³:

x³ = (k/a)^(3/2), so a²x³ = a²*(k/a)^(3/2) = a²*(k^(3/2)/a^(3/2)) = a^(2 - 3/2) * k^(3/2) = a^(1/2) * k^(3/2).

Similarly for the other terms. So total equation 1:

a^(1/2) * k^(3/2) + b^(1/2) * k^(3/2) + c^(1/2) * k^(3/2) = p⁵

Factor out k^(3/2):

k^(3/2) * (a^(1/2) + b^(1/2) + c^(1/2)) = p⁵

But a^(1/2) + b^(1/2) + c^(1/2) = S, so:

k^(3/2) * S = p⁵

But k = S² p², so k^(3/2) = (S² p²)^(3/2) = S³ p³. Therefore:

S³ p³ * S = S⁴ p³ = p⁵

Thus, S⁴ p³ = p⁵ ⇒ S⁴ = p² ⇒ S² = p ⇒ S = sqrt(p).

But earlier, when I considered S = sqrt(k)/p and k = S² p², then S = sqrt(S² p²)/p = (S p)/p = S. So consistent but doesn't give a numerical value. However, from equation 1, we derive S = sqrt(p).

But when I plug p = 4, S = 2, then k = (2)^2 * 4^2 = 4 * 16 = 64. Then equation 1: S * k^(3/2) = 2 * (64)^(3/2) = 2 * 256 = 512 ≠ 4^5 = 1024. Contradiction. Therefore, something is wrong here.

Wait, this suggests that there is an error in the derivation. Let me check once more.

From equation 3: S = sqrt(k)/p ⇒ sqrt(k) = S p ⇒ k = S² p².

From equation 1: S * k^(3/2) = p⁵.

Substitute k = S² p² into that:

S * (S² p²)^(3/2) = S * (S³ p³) = S⁴ p³ = p⁵ ⇒ S⁴ = p² ⇒ S² = p ⇒ S = sqrt(p).

But when we plug back S = sqrt(p) into equation 3, we get sqrt(k) = S p = sqrt(p) * p = p^(3/2) ⇒ k = p³.

Then, equation 1: S * k^(3/2) = sqrt(p) * (p³)^(3/2) = sqrt(p) * p^(9/2) = p^(10/2) = p⁵. Which matches p⁵. Wait, but sqrt(p) * p^(9/2) is p^(1/2 + 9/2) = p^(10/2) = p⁵. Yes, that works. So there was a miscalculation earlier when I tried p=4.

Wait, let's check with p=4.

If S = sqrt(p) = 2.

Then k = S² p² = (2)^2 * (4)^2 = 4 * 16 = 64.

Then equation 1: S * k^(3/2) = 2 * (64)^(3/2) = 2 * (8)^3 = 2 * 512 = 1024, which is p⁵ = 4⁵ = 1024. Correct. So that works. Earlier mistake was in the manual calculation where I thought k^(3/2) was 256, but actually (64)^(3/2) = (8^2)^(3/2) = 8^3 = 512. So yes, 2*512=1024=4^5. So correct. Therefore, S = sqrt(p) is correct.

But then earlier when I thought S = p, that was wrong. So where did that come from?

Ah, I see. The mistake was in the step where I took both sides to the power 2/5. Let me re-examine that.

From equation 1 substitution:

S^(5/2) p^(3/2) = p⁵.

Divide both sides by p^(3/2):

S^(5/2) = p^(5/2).

Then take both sides to the power 2/5:

(S^(5/2))^(2/5) = (p^(5/2))^(2/5) ⇒ S^((5/2)*(2/5)) = p^((5/2)*(2/5)) ⇒ S^1 = p^1 ⇒ S = p.

Wait, but this contradicts the previous result. So which is correct?

Wait, according to the substitution method, S = sqrt(p). But according to the exponent manipulation, S = p. There's a conflict here. Which one is correct?

Let me check with p=1.

If p=1:

From equation 3: S = sqrt(k)/1 ⇒ sqrt(k) = S.

From equation 1: S * k^(3/2) = 1^5 = 1.

Substitute k = S²:

S * (S²)^(3/2) = S * S³ = S⁴ = 1 ⇒ S = 1.

But according to S = sqrt(p), S = 1. Which matches. According to S = p, S = 1. So both agree here.

Wait, but when p=1, S=1. So both methods agree.

Wait, let's try p=9.

From equation 3: S = sqrt(k)/9 ⇒ sqrt(k) = 9S ⇒ k = 81S².

From equation 1: S * (81S²)^(3/2) = S * (81^(3/2) S³) = S * (27*9 S³) = S * 243 S³ = 243 S⁴ = 9^5 = 59049.

So 243 S⁴ = 59049 ⇒ S⁴ = 59049 / 243 = 243 ⇒ S⁴ = 243 ⇒ S = (243)^(1/4) = (3^5)^(1/4) = 3^(5/4) ≈ 4.2426.

But according to S = sqrt(p), S = sqrt(9) = 3. But according to this calculation, S ≈4.2426. Contradiction.

Wait, this is confusing. So when p=9, according to substitution, S = sqrt(9) = 3. But according to equation 1 substitution, S ≈4.2426. So there's a conflict. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the process.

Wait, perhaps I need to double-check the substitution steps.

Let me redo the substitution with p=9.

Given p=9.

From equation 3: S = sqrt(k)/9 ⇒ sqrt(k) = 9S ⇒ k = 81S².

From equation 1: S * k^(3/2) = 9^5 = 59049.

Substitute k =81S²:

S * (81S²)^(3/2) = S * (81^(3/2) * S³) = S * (27*9 * S³) = S * 243 S³ = 243 S⁴ = 59049.

Therefore, S⁴ = 59049 / 243 = 243 ⇒ S⁴=243 ⇒ S=243^(1/4). 243 is 3^5, so 243^(1/4)=3^(5/4)=3^(1 + 1/4)=3*3^(1/4)≈3*1.316≈3.948. But according to S=sqrt(p)=3, which is different. So this is a problem.

This suggests that there's a mistake in the substitution process. Therefore, my previous conclusion that S=sqrt(p) might be wrong. But where?

Wait, let's check the equation 1 substitution again.

Given:

a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵.

But x = sqrt(k/a), so x³ = (k/a)^(3/2). Then a²x³ = a²*(k/a)^(3/2) = a²*(k^(3/2)/a^(3/2)) = a^(2 - 3/2)*k^(3/2) = a^(1/2)*k^(3/2). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, exponent rules: a^(2 - 3/2) = a^(1/2). Yes, that's right. So a²x³ = a^(1/2)k^(3/2). Similarly for the other terms. So total sum is (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) * k^(3/2) = S * k^(3/2).

But S = sqrt(k)/p ⇒ k = (S p)^2. Therefore, k^(3/2) = (S p)^3.

Thus, equation 1 becomes S * (S p)^3 = S^4 p^3 = p^5 ⇒ S^4 = p^2 ⇒ S^2 = p ⇒ S = sqrt(p).

But according to this, when p=9, S=3. But when I plug back, it doesn't satisfy equation 1. So contradiction.

Wait, but according to this substitution, if S = sqrt(p), then k = (sqrt(p) * p)^2 = (p^(3/2))^2 = p^3. Then equation 1: S * k^(3/2) = sqrt(p) * (p^3)^(3/2) = sqrt(p) * p^(9/2) = p^(1/2 + 9/2) = p^5. Which is correct. So where is the mistake?

Ah! When I calculated S for p=9 manually, I made a mistake. Let's redo the calculation.

If p=9, then according to S=sqrt(p)=3.

Then k = (S p)^2 = (3*9)^2 = 27^2 = 729.

Then equation 1: S * k^(3/2) = 3 * (729)^(3/2).

Calculate 729^(3/2): sqrt(729)=27, so 27^3=19683.

Thus, 3 * 19683 = 59049, which is 9^5=59049. Correct. So why did my previous manual calculation with p=9 give a different result? Because I incorrectly substituted k=81S² instead of k=(S p)^2. Wait, no. Wait, according to equation 3, sqrt(k) = S p ⇒ k=(S p)^2. But earlier, I thought k = S² p², which is the same. Wait, (S p)^2 = S² p². So that's correct.

But when I did the substitution for p=9, I wrote S * (81S²)^(3/2), but that's incorrect. Because k should be (S p)^2 = (3*9)^2=27^2=729. So the correct substitution is S * k^(3/2) = 3 * 729^(3/2) = 3 * 19683 = 59049, which is correct. Therefore, my earlier manual calculation was incorrect because I used k=81S², which is wrong. The correct k is (S p)^2, not S² p². Wait, no, (S p)^2 is S² p². So why did I get different results?

Wait, if S=sqrt(p), then k=(S p)^2 = (p^(1/2)*p)^2 = (p^(3/2))^2 = p^3. So k=p^3. Therefore, equation 1: S * k^(3/2) = sqrt(p) * (p^3)^(3/2) = sqrt(p) * p^(9/2) = p^(1/2 + 9/2) = p^5. Correct. So my mistake was in the manual calculation where I incorrectly set k=81S², which is not the case. The correct k=(S p)^2. So when p=9, S=3, so k=(3*9)^2=27^2=729. Therefore, equation 1 is satisfied. So previous mistake was in my manual calculation where I used k=81S² instead of k=(S p)^2. Therefore, S=sqrt(p) is correct.

Therefore, the correct answer is sqrt(p). So sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(p).

But wait, the original problem statement says to express sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) in terms of p. So according to this, the answer is sqrt(p). But let me check again with another example.

Let p=1:

Then S=sqrt(1)=1.

From equation 3: sqrt(k)/1 =1 ⇒ sqrt(k)=1 ⇒k=1.

From equation 1: S * k^(3/2) =1 *1^(3/2)=1=1^5. Correct.

Another example, p=4:

S=sqrt(4)=2.

k=(2*4)^2=8^2=64.

Equation 1: 2 *64^(3/2)=2*256=512=4^5=1024? Wait, 4^5 is 1024, 512≠1024. Wait, this is a problem.

Wait, p=4, S=2, k=64.

Equation 1: 2*64^(3/2)=2*256=512. But p^5=1024. So 512≠1024. Contradiction. Therefore, something is wrong.

Wait, but according to the formula S=sqrt(p), when p=4, S=2, but equation 1 is not satisfied. Therefore, this suggests an error in the derivation.

Wait, but earlier when I did p=9, it worked. What's the difference?

Wait, p=4:

If S=sqrt(p)=2, then k=(2*4)^2=64.

Equation 1: S * k^(3/2)=2*64^(3/2)=2*256=512. But p^5=1024. So 512≠1024. Contradiction.

But according to the derivation, S=sqrt(p) should satisfy equation 1. So why isn't it working here?

Wait, this is perplexing. Let's check the steps again.

From equation 3: S=sqrt(k)/p ⇒ sqrt(k)=S p ⇒k=(S p)^2.

From equation 1: S *k^(3/2)=p^5.

Substitute k=(S p)^2:

S * ((S p)^2)^(3/2)=S*(S p)^3=S*(S^3 p^3)=S^4 p^3=p^5 ⇒S^4=p^2 ⇒S^2=p ⇒S=sqrt(p).

But when p=4, S=sqrt(4)=2, and then k=(2*4)^2=64. Then equation 1: 2*64^(3/2)=2*256=512≠1024. So clearly, there's a mistake here.

Wait, this suggests that the derivation is incorrect. But where?

Wait, let's check the substitution in equation 1 again.

Given:

a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p^5.

But ax² = by² = cz² =k. Therefore, x= sqrt(k/a), etc.

So x³=(k/a)^(3/2), so a²x³= a²*(k/a)^(3/2)=a²*k^(3/2)/a^(3/2)=a^(2 - 3/2)*k^(3/2)=a^(1/2)*k^(3/2). Similarly for the other terms. So total sum is sqrt(a)k^(3/2)+sqrt(b)k^(3/2)+sqrt(c)k^(3/2)=k^(3/2)(sqrt(a)+sqrt(b)+sqrt(c))=S*k^(3/2)=p^5.

But S=sqrt(k)/p ⇒k=(S p)^2. Therefore, S*k^(3/2)=S*(S p)^3=S^4 p^3=p^5 ⇒S^4 p^3=p^5 ⇒S^4=p^2 ⇒S^2=p ⇒S=sqrt(p).

But this leads to inconsistency in examples. So perhaps the error is in the assumption that all variables are positive? Or maybe I need to check the algebra again.

Wait, let's do the substitution again step by step for p=4.

If p=4:

From equation 3: S=sqrt(k)/4 ⇒sqrt(k)=4S ⇒k=16S².

From equation 1: S* k^(3/2)=4^5=1024.

Substitute k=16S²:

S*(16S²)^(3/2)=S*(16^(3/2)*S³)=S*(64*S³)=64S⁴=1024.

Thus, 64S⁴=1024 ⇒S⁴=16 ⇒S=2.

But S=sqrt(p)=2, which is correct. Then k=16*(2)^2=16*4=64.

Then equation 1: S*k^(3/2)=2*64^(3/2)=2*256=512. Wait, but according to this, 64S⁴=1024 ⇒S=2, but 2*256=512≠1024. Contradiction.

Wait, this is impossible. The substitution steps must be wrong.

Wait, but 64S⁴=1024 ⇒S⁴=16 ⇒S=2. Then equation 1 is 2*256=512. But 512≠1024. Therefore, there is a mistake in the substitution.

Wait, but how? The steps seem correct. Let's see:

If k=16S², then k^(3/2)= (16S²)^(3/2)= (16^(3/2))*(S²)^(3/2)= (64)*(S³). So equation 1: S*64*S³=64S⁴=1024 ⇒S⁴=16 ⇒S=2. But then equation 1: 2*64^(3/2)=2*(8^3)=2*512=1024. Wait, wait! Wait, 16^(3/2)= (4^2)^(3/2)=4^3=64. So 64^(3/2)= (8^2)^(3/2)=8^3=512. Wait, no! Wait, 64^(3/2)= (8^2)^(3/2)=8^3=512. But S*k^(3/2)=2*512=1024, which is correct. Wait, but earlier when I calculated 64^(3/2), I thought it was 256. That was my mistake.

Wait, 64^(3/2)=sqrt(64)^3=8^3=512. So 2*512=1024=4^5. Correct. Therefore, when p=4, S=2, which is sqrt(4)=2, and equation 1 is satisfied. Earlier mistake was in calculating 64^(3/2) as 256 instead of 512. So all is correct.

Therefore, the conclusion that S=sqrt(p) is correct. Therefore, the answer is sqrt(p).

But the problem says to express √a + √b + √c in terms of p, and according to this, it's sqrt(p). However, the problem statement mentions ""frac{2}{3}"" at the end, which might be a typo. Perhaps the answer is p^(2/3)? But according to the derivation, it's sqrt(p).

Wait, the original problem says:

""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. frac{2}{3}""

Maybe the ""frac{2}{3}"" is part of the problem statement, perhaps indicating the exponent? Or maybe a typo. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is p^(2/3). But according to the derivation, it's p^(1/2). So which is correct?

Wait, let's check the substitution again.

From equation 1:

After substituting, we have S^4 p^3 = p^5 ⇒ S^4 = p^2 ⇒ S = p^(2/4) = p^(1/2). So yes, S=sqrt(p). Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(p). The ""frac{2}{3}"" in the problem statement might be extraneous or a typo.

Therefore, after careful consideration and checking, the correct answer is sqrt(p), which is p^(1/2). The ""frac{2}{3}"" might have been a mistake or perhaps related to a different problem.

2. \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2\\)
3. \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

We need to express \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of \\(p\\).

First, we denote the common value of \\(ax^2\\), \\(by^2\\), and \\(cz^2\\) as \\(k\\). Thus, we have:

","Okay, let's see. I need to express √a + √b + √c in terms of p using the given equations. Hmm, let's start by looking at the equations one by one and see how they might connect.

First, equation 2 says that ax² = by² = cz². That seems like a proportionality condition. Maybe I can set ax² = by² = cz² = k for some constant k. Then, each of them equals k, so I can express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c, and k. Let me try that.

So, ax² = k ⇒ x = √(k/a). Similarly, y = √(k/b) and z = √(k/c). That might be useful. Let me write that down:

x = √(k/a)
y = √(k/b)
z = √(k/c)

Now, equation 3 is 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Let's substitute the expressions for x, y, z into this equation.

1/√(k/a) + 1/√(k/b) + 1/√(k/c) = 1/p

Simplifying each term, 1/√(k/a) is the same as √(a/k). So:

√(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = 1/p

Factor out √(1/k):

√(1/k)(√a + √b + √c) = 1/p

Let me denote √a + √b + √c as S, so:

√(1/k) * S = 1/p ⇒ S = (1/p) / √(1/k) = (√k)/p

So S = √k / p. That's interesting. So √a + √b + √c = √k / p. Hmm, but I need to express S in terms of p. So maybe I can find k in terms of p?

Let's look at equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Substitute x, y, z from above into this equation.

First, compute x³, y³, z³:

x³ = (k/a)^(3/2)
y³ = (k/b)^(3/2)
z³ = (k/c)^(3/2)

So equation 1 becomes:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = p⁵

Simplify each term. Let's take the first term: a²*(k/a)^(3/2) = a² * k^(3/2) / a^(3/2) = a^(1/2) * k^(3/2). Similarly for the others.

So:

a^(1/2) * k^(3/2) + b^(1/2) * k^(3/2) + c^(1/2) * k^(3/2) = p⁵

Factor out k^(3/2):

k^(3/2) * (√a + √b + √c) = p⁵

But we already found that √a + √b + √c = S = √k / p. Substitute that into the equation:

k^(3/2) * (√k / p) = p⁵

Simplify the left side: k^(3/2 + 1/2) = k². So:

k² / p = p⁵ ⇒ k² = p⁶ ⇒ k = p³ (since k is positive, assuming all variables are positive)

Now, substitute k = p³ back into S = √k / p:

√(p³)/p = (p^(3/2))/p = p^(1/2) = √p

Wait, that seems straightforward. So √a + √b + √c = √p. But let me check if all steps are correct.

First, setting ax² = by² = cz² = k is valid because they are all equal. Then expressing x, y, z in terms of k. Substituting into equation 3 gives S in terms of k and p. Then substituting into equation 1, expressing in terms of S and k, then solving for k. Then substituting back. Let's verify each step.

Yes, the steps seem logical. Let's check the substitution into equation 1:

Original equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵

Expressed as:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = p⁵

Which simplifies to:

a² * k^(3/2) / a^(3/2) + b² * k^(3/2) / b^(3/2) + c² * k^(3/2) / c^(3/2) = p⁵

Simplifying exponents:

For the a term: 2 - 3/2 = 1/2, so a^(1/2) * k^(3/2). Similarly for others. Then factoring out k^(3/2) gives k^(3/2)(S) = p⁵. Then substituting S = √k / p gives k^(3/2)*(√k / p) = k² / p = p⁵. Therefore, k² = p⁶, so k = p³. Then S = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p. So yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, √a + √b + √c = √p. Let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, did I handle the substitution correctly? When I set ax² = by² = cz² = k, then x, y, z are expressed in terms of a, b, c, k. Then substituting into equation 3 gives an expression involving S and k. Then equation 1 gives another equation involving S and k. Solving these two equations gives k and S. Then solving gives S in terms of p. Seems okay.

Another way: Maybe there's a different approach. Let's see. Let's denote S = √a + √b + √c. We need to find S in terms of p. Let's see if we can relate the given equations to S.

From equation 2, ax² = by² = cz². Let's denote t = ax² = by² = cz². Then x = √(t/a), y = √(t/b), z = √(t/c). Then 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p becomes √(a/t) + √(b/t) + √(c/t) = 1/p. Which is the same as S * √(1/t) = 1/p. So S = (1/p) * √t. So S = √t / p. Then equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵.

Expressed in terms of t:

x³ = (t/a)^(3/2), so a²x³ = a²*(t/a)^(3/2) = a² * t^(3/2)/a^(3/2) = a^(1/2)*t^(3/2). Similarly for others. Therefore, equation 1 becomes t^(3/2)(√a + √b + √c) = p⁵. But √a + √b + √c = S = √t / p. Substitute:

t^(3/2)*(√t / p) = p⁵ ⇒ t^(2) / p = p⁵ ⇒ t² = p⁶ ⇒ t = p³. Then S = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p. So same result.

Therefore, the answer is √p. Wait, but in the original problem, the user wrote ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. 2/3"". Maybe that was a typo? Or maybe the answer is (√p)^(2/3)? Wait, but according to the calculations, it's √p. Hmm. Let me check again.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent when simplifying. Let me recheck:

√(p³) is p^(3/2). Divided by p is p^(3/2 - 1) = p^(1/2). So yes, p^(1/2) = √p. So the answer is √p. So why does the user mention 2/3? Maybe a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps I need to check again.

Wait, let me check the equations again. Maybe there's a miscalculation in exponents.

Original equations:

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵

2. ax² = by² = cz²

3. 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p

Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p.

My steps:

Set ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then x = √(k/a), etc.

Then equation 3: sum of reciprocals equals 1/p. Expressed as S * √(1/k) = 1/p ⇒ S = √k / p.

Then equation 1: sum of a²x³ etc. Expressed in terms of k and S. Which gives k^(3/2) * S = p⁵. Then substituting S gives k² / p = p⁵ ⇒ k² = p⁶ ⇒ k = p³. Then S = √(p³)/p = √p. So all steps check out.

Therefore, the answer is √p. The mention of 2/3 might be a typo or part of the problem's formatting. Unless I made an error in the calculation.

Wait, let me check equation 1 again. When I substitute x³, which is (k/a)^(3/2), multiply by a²:

a² * (k/a)^(3/2) = a² * k^(3/2) / a^(3/2) = a^(1/2) * k^(3/2). Similarly for others. Then sum them up:

a^(1/2) * k^(3/2) + b^(1/2) * k^(3/2) + c^(1/2) * k^(3/2) = k^(3/2) (a^(1/2) + b^(1/2) + c^(1/2)) = k^(3/2) * S.

Set equal to p⁵: k^(3/2) * S = p⁵. Then substitute S = √k / p:

k^(3/2) * √k / p = k² / p = p⁵ ⇒ k² = p⁶ ⇒ k = p³. Then S = √(p³) / p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2). So yes, √p.

Therefore, the answer is √p. The 2/3 might be a red herring or part of a different problem. So unless there's a miscalculation, I think the answer is √p. Therefore, the expression is √p, which can be written as p^(1/2). Therefore, boxed, it's \\boxed{\\sqrt{p}}.

","Okay, so I need to express √a + √b + √c in terms of p, given these three equations. Let me try to break this down step by step. 

First, let's look at the given equations:

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵
2. ax² = by² = cz²
3. 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p

Hmm, equation 2 says that ax², by², and cz² are all equal. Maybe I can set them equal to some common variable. Let me denote this common value as k. So:

ax² = by² = cz² = k

Then, from this, I can express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c, and k. Let's see:

From ax² = k, we get x² = k/a, so x = √(k/a). Similarly, y = √(k/b) and z = √(k/c). But wait, since x, y, z are variables, maybe they can be expressed in terms of k and the square roots of a, b, c. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe express a, b, c in terms of x, y, z. Let me try that. From ax² = k, so a = k / x². Similarly, b = k / y² and c = k / z². Then, √a = √(k / x²) = √k / x. Similarly, √b = √k / y and √c = √k / z. So, the sum √a + √b + √c would be √k (1/x + 1/y + 1/z). But wait, equation 3 is exactly 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. So substituting that in, we get √a + √b + √c = √k * (1/p). So, if I can find √k in terms of p, then I can express the sum as something over p.

But how do I find √k? Let's see. Let's look at equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Since we have a, b, c in terms of x, y, z (from equation 2), maybe substitute those into equation 1.

Given that a = k / x², then a² = k² / x⁴. Similarly, b² = k² / y⁴ and c² = k² / z⁴. Then equation 1 becomes:

(k² / x⁴)x³ + (k² / y⁴)y³ + (k² / z⁴)z³ = p⁵

Simplify each term:

k² / x + k² / y + k² / z = p⁵

Factor out k²:

k² (1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = p⁵

But from equation 3, we know that 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. So substituting that in:

k² * (1/p) = p⁵

Therefore, k² = p⁶

Taking square roots, k = p³ (assuming k is positive, which it should be since we're dealing with squares and square roots)

So, k = p³. Then, going back to the expression for √a + √b + √c, which was √k * (1/p). Since √k = √(p³) = p^(3/2), so:

√a + √b + √c = p^(3/2) * (1/p) = p^(1/2) = √p

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me check if I did everything correctly.

Starting again, let me verify each step.

1. Set ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, express a, b, c as k/x², k/y², k/z². Correct.

2. Then, compute √a + √b + √c. Each term is √(k/x²) = √k / x, etc. So sum is √k (1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = √k / p. Since 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Correct.

3. Then, substitute into equation 1. Compute a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³. Substitute a² = (k²)/(x⁴), so multiplied by x³ gives k²/x. Similarly for others. Sum is k²(1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = k²/p = p⁵. Therefore, k² = p⁶, so k = p³. Correct.

4. Then, √k is p^(3/2), multiplied by 1/p gives p^(1/2) = √p. So √a + √b + √c = √p.

Wait, that seems correct. Let me check if there's any missing step or possible mistake.

Another way to check: Let's assume some values. Suppose p = 1. Then according to this, √a + √b + √c = 1. Let's see if that works.

If p = 1, then equation 3 is 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1. Then, from equation 2, ax² = by² = cz² = k = p³ = 1. So a = 1/x², b = 1/y², c = 1/z². Then, √a + √b + √c = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1, which matches. Then equation 1 would be a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = (1/x²)² x³ + ... = 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1 = p⁵ = 1. So that works. So for p = 1, it's correct.

Another test case: Let p = 2. Then √a + √b + √c should be √2. Let's see. Then k = p³ = 8. So a = 8/x², b = 8/y², c = 8/z². Then equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/2. So the sum of reciprocals is 1/2. Then, equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = (64/x⁴)x³ + ... = 64/x + 64/y + 64/z = 64(1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = 64*(1/2) = 32. But p⁵ = 32. So 32 = 32. That works. Then √a + √b + √c = √(8/x²) + √(8/y²) + √(8/z²) = (2√2)/x + (2√2)/y + (2√2)/z = 2√2(1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = 2√2*(1/2) = √2. Which matches √p = √2. So that works.

Therefore, the solution seems correct. Therefore, √a + √b + √c = √p.

Given the equations:

1. \\(a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5\\)
2. \\(ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2\\)
3. \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

We need to express \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of \\(p\\).

First, we denote the common value of \\(ax^2\\), \\(by^2\\), and \\(cz^2\\) as \\(k\\). Thus, we have:
\\[ ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k \\]

From this, we can express \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) as:
\\[ x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}}, \\quad y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{b}}, \\quad z = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{c}} \\]

Substituting these into equation 3:
\\[ \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\sqrt{\\frac{a}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{b}{k}} + \\sqrt{\\frac{c}{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\]

This simplifies to:
\\[ \\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\]
\\[ \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\]

Next, we substitute \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) into equation 1:
\\[ a^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{a} \\right)^{3/2} + b^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{b} \\right)^{3/2} + c^2 \\left( \\frac{k}{c} \\right)^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

Simplifying each term:

\\[ (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) k^{3/2} = p^5 \\]

Using \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\) from equation 3:
\\[ \\left( \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\right) k^{3/2} = p^5 \\]
\\[ \\frac{k^2}{p} = p^5 \\]
\\[ k^2 = p^6 \\]
\\[ k = p^3 \\]

Substituting \\(k = p^3\\) back into \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p}\\):

","Okay, so I've got this problem here with three equations, and I need to express the sum of the square roots of a, b, and c in terms of p. Let me try to break this down step by step. First, let me write down the equations again to have them clear:

1. \\( a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5 \\)
2. \\( ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 \\)
3. \\( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p} \\)

The goal is to find \\( \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\) in terms of p. Hmm, okay. Let's start by looking at equation 2. It says that \\( ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 \\). This suggests that all three expressions \\( ax^2 \\), \\( by^2 \\), and \\( cz^2 \\) are equal to the same constant. Let me denote this common value as k. So, let's set:

\\( ax^2 = by^2 = cz^2 = k \\)

That might make things easier to handle. So, from this, I can express x, y, and z in terms of a, b, c, and k. Let's see:

From \\( ax^2 = k \\), we get \\( x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}} \\)
Similarly, \\( y = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{b}} \\)
And \\( z = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{c}} \\)

But since x, y, z are under square roots, we can consider them positive for simplicity. So, maybe we can take the positive roots.

Now, let's look at equation 3: \\( \\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p} \\)

Substituting the expressions for x, y, z from above:

\\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{b}}} + \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{\\frac{k}{c}}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\)

Simplify each term:

\\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a}}{\\sqrt{k}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{b}}{\\sqrt{k}} + \\frac{\\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\)

Factor out \\( \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{k}} \\):

\\( \\frac{\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\)

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me denote \\( S = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\). Then, the equation becomes:

\\( \\frac{S}{\\sqrt{k}} = \\frac{1}{p} \\)

So, solving for S:

\\( S = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\)

But we need to express S in terms of p, so maybe we can find k in terms of p as well.

Let me look back at the other equations. Equation 1 is:

\\( a^2x^3 + b^2y^3 + c^2z^3 = p^5 \\)

Again, substitute x, y, z in terms of a, b, c, and k.

First, let's compute x^3:

\\( x = \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{a}} \\), so \\( x^3 = \\left( \\frac{k}{a} \\right)^{3/2} = \\frac{k^{3/2}}{a^{3/2}} \\)

Similarly, \\( y^3 = \\frac{k^{3/2}}{b^{3/2}} \\), and \\( z^3 = \\frac{k^{3/2}}{c^{3/2}} \\)

Therefore, substituting into equation 1:

\\( a^2 \\cdot \\frac{k^{3/2}}{a^{3/2}} + b^2 \\cdot \\frac{k^{3/2}}{b^{3/2}} + c^2 \\cdot \\frac{k^{3/2}}{c^{3/2}} = p^5 \\)

Simplify each term:

First term: \\( a^2 \\cdot \\frac{k^{3/2}}{a^{3/2}} = \\frac{k^{3/2} a^{1/2}}{1} = \\sqrt{a} \\cdot k^{3/2} \\)

Similarly, the second term is \\( \\sqrt{b} \\cdot k^{3/2} \\), and the third term is \\( \\sqrt{c} \\cdot k^{3/2} \\)

So, equation 1 becomes:

\\( \\sqrt{a} \\cdot k^{3/2} + \\sqrt{b} \\cdot k^{3/2} + \\sqrt{c} \\cdot k^{3/2} = p^5 \\)

Factor out \\( k^{3/2} \\):

\\( (\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}) \\cdot k^{3/2} = p^5 \\)

But from earlier, we found that \\( S = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\)

So, substituting S into equation 1:

\\( \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\cdot k^{3/2} = p^5 \\)

Simplify the left side:

\\( \\frac{\\sqrt{k} \\cdot k^{3/2}}{p} = \\frac{k^{2}}{p} \\)

So:

\\( \\frac{k^2}{p} = p^5 \\)

Multiply both sides by p:

\\( k^2 = p^6 \\)

Take square roots:

\\( k = p^3 \\) (assuming k is positive, which it should be since it's under a square root in the expressions for x, y, z)

Now, going back to equation 3 where we had:

\\( S = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\)

Substitute k = p^3:

\\( S = \\frac{\\sqrt{p^3}}{p} = \\frac{p^{3/2}}{p} = p^{1/2} = \\sqrt{p} \\)

Wait, but the problem says to express \\( \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} \\) in terms of p, and according to this, it's \\( \\sqrt{p} \\). But let me check if I made any mistakes here.

Wait, let's go through the steps again. Let's verify each part.

Starting with equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c). Then equation 3 becomes 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p, which is sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p. Factoring out 1/sqrt(k), we get (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(k) = 1/p. Therefore, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. So S = sqrt(k)/p.

Then equation 1: after substituting x³, etc., becomes (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) * k^{3/2} = p^5. So S * k^{3/2} = p^5. But S is sqrt(k)/p, so substituting:

(sqrt(k)/p) * k^{3/2} = p^5

Multiply sqrt(k) and k^{3/2}: sqrt(k) is k^{1/2}, so k^{1/2} * k^{3/2} = k^{2}

So (k²)/p = p^5 => k² = p^6 => k = p³. Then S = sqrt(p³)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So the answer is sqrt(p). But the problem says ""Express sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) in terms of p"", and according to this, it's sqrt(p). But maybe I made a mistake in the exponent when simplifying.

Wait, let me check the substitution again. When I had S = sqrt(k)/p, and then S * k^{3/2} = p^5. So substituting S:

(sqrt(k)/p) * k^{3/2} = p^5

Multiply sqrt(k) (which is k^{1/2}) and k^{3/2} gives k^{2}. So:

k² / p = p^5 => k² = p^6 => k = p³. Then S = sqrt(p³)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). That seems correct.

But let me check if there's a different approach. Maybe using ratios.

Since ax² = by² = cz², let me denote that common value as k, as before. Then, we can write:

x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c)

Then, equation 3 is 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Substituting:

sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p

Which factors as (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(k) = 1/p => sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p = S.

Then, equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p^5. Substitute x³, y³, z³:

a²*(k/a)^{3/2} + b²*(k/b)^{3/2} + c²*(k/c)^{3/2} = p^5

Simplify each term:

a²*(k^{3/2}/a^{3/2}) = a^{1/2}k^{3/2} = sqrt(a)*k^{3/2}

Similarly for others. Then:

sqrt(a)*k^{3/2} + sqrt(b)*k^{3/2} + sqrt(c)*k^{3/2} = p^5

Factor out k^{3/2}:

(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) * k^{3/2} = p^5

But sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = S = sqrt(k)/p, so:

(sqrt(k)/p) * k^{3/2} = p^5

Which is (k^{2})/p = p^5 => k² = p^6 => k = p³. Then S = sqrt(p³)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So yes, same result.

But wait, the problem mentions ""Express sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) in terms of p"". So according to this, the answer is sqrt(p). But maybe I need to rationalize or present it differently? Let me check if there's any mistake.

Alternatively, let's consider the problem again. Maybe there's a different approach. Let me think.

Suppose we let ax² = by² = cz² = t, where t is some common value. Then, x = sqrt(t/a), y = sqrt(t/b), z = sqrt(t/c). Then equation 3 becomes:

1/sqrt(t/a) + 1/sqrt(t/b) + 1/sqrt(t/c) = 1/p

Which is sqrt(a/t) + sqrt(b/t) + sqrt(c/t) = 1/p

Factor out 1/sqrt(t):

( sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) ) / sqrt(t) = 1/p

So sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(t)/p = S

Then equation 1:

a²*(t/a)^{3/2} + b²*(t/b)^{3/2} + c²*(t/c)^{3/2} = p^5

Which simplifies to sqrt(a)*t^{3/2} + sqrt(b)*t^{3/2} + sqrt(c)*t^{3/2} = p^5

Factor out t^{3/2}:

( sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) ) * t^{3/2} = p^5

Substitute S = sqrt(t)/p:

( sqrt(t)/p ) * t^{3/2} = p^5

Multiply sqrt(t) * t^{3/2} = t^{2}

So t² / p = p^5 => t² = p^6 => t = p³

Then S = sqrt(t)/p = sqrt(p³)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So again, same result.

Therefore, the answer is sqrt(p). However, the problem says ""Express sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) in terms of p. 2/3"". Wait, maybe there's a typo here? The original problem says ""Express ... in terms of p.\\frac{2}{3}"". Hmm, maybe it's supposed to be ""Express ... in terms of p^{2/3}""? Or perhaps the user made a formatting mistake. Alternatively, maybe the answer is p^{2/3}?

Wait, let me check again. Wait, if we have S = sqrt(p), but maybe I made a mistake in the exponents.

Wait, let's recast the problem. Let's use different variables. Let me denote:

Let’s set ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c). Then equation 3:

1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p => sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = 1/p => (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(k) = 1/p => sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p.

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p^5. Substitute x³:

x³ = (k/a)^{3/2} = k^{3/2}/a^{3/2}, so a² * x³ = a² * k^{3/2}/a^{3/2} = a^{1/2}k^{3/2} = sqrt(a) * k^{3/2}

Similarly, b²y³ = sqrt(b) * k^{3/2}, c²z³ = sqrt(c) * k^{3/2}

Therefore, equation 1 becomes:

sqrt(a)k^{3/2} + sqrt(b)k^{3/2} + sqrt(c)k^{3/2} = p^5

Factor out k^{3/2}:

( sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) ) k^{3/2} = p^5

But from equation 3, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Therefore:

( sqrt(k)/p ) * k^{3/2} = p^5

Simplify:

sqrt(k) * k^{3/2} = k^{2} = p^6 => k = p^3

Therefore, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p = sqrt(p^3)/p = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So answer is sqrt(p). But the problem mentions ""in terms of p. 2/3"". Maybe it's a formatting error, and the correct answer is p^{2/3}? Wait, but according to the calculations, it's p^{1/2}. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the exponent when combining sqrt(k) and k^{3/2}.

Wait, sqrt(k) is k^{1/2}, and k^{3/2}, so multiplying them gives k^{1/2 + 3/2} = k^{2}. So that's correct. Then k² = p^6 => k = p^3. Then sqrt(k) = p^{3/2}, so sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2} = sqrt(p). So answer is sqrt(p). Therefore, unless there's an error in the problem statement, the answer should be sqrt(p). Maybe the original problem had a different exponent? Alternatively, maybe I need to rationalize or present it differently. But according to the steps, it's sqrt(p). Let me check once again.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation in the exponents. Wait, if k = p³, then sqrt(k) = p^{3/2}, so S = p^{3/2}/p = p^{1/2}. Yes. Therefore, the answer is sqrt(p). So unless the problem has a typo, the answer is sqrt(p). Therefore, the final answer is \\boxed{\\sqrt{p}}.

This simplifies to:

\\[ \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c} = \\frac{\\sqrt{k}}{p} \\]

","Okay, so I need to find the value of √a + √b + √c in terms of p using the given equations. Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵
2. ax² = by² = cz²
3. 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p

Hmm, equation 2 says that ax², by², and cz² are all equal. Let me denote that common value as some constant, maybe k. So:

ax² = by² = cz² = k

That might help me express x, y, z in terms of a, b, c, and k. Let me try solving for x, y, z from this equation.

From ax² = k, we can solve for x: x = √(k/a). Similarly, y = √(k/b) and z = √(k/c). So each variable x, y, z is expressed in terms of a, b, c, and k.

Now, let's look at equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Substituting the expressions for x, y, z into this equation:

1/√(k/a) + 1/√(k/b) + 1/√(k/c) = 1/p

Simplify each term:

√(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = 1/p

Factor out √(1/k):

√(1/k)(√a + √b + √c) = 1/p

Let me denote S = √a + √b + √c. Then:

√(1/k) * S = 1/p

So, S = √k / p

Hmm, that's interesting. So S is equal to √k divided by p. If I can find the value of k, then I can express S in terms of p.

Now let's look at equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. Substitute x, y, z from earlier expressions.

x³ = (k/a)^(3/2), since x = √(k/a). Similarly for y³ and z³.

So equation 1 becomes:

a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = p⁵

Simplify each term:

a² * (k/a)^(3/2) = a² * k^(3/2) / a^(3/2) = a^(1/2) * k^(3/2)

Similarly for the other terms:

b²*(k/b)^(3/2) = b^(1/2) * k^(3/2)

c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = c^(1/2) * k^(3/2)

So adding them up:

k^(3/2)(√a + √b + √c) = p⁵

But we already have S = √a + √b + √c = √k / p

So substituting S into the equation:

k^(3/2) * (√k / p) = p⁵

Simplify the left side:

k^(3/2) * √k = k^(3/2 + 1/2) = k^2

So equation becomes:

k² / p = p⁵

Multiply both sides by p:

k² = p⁶

Take square roots:

k = p³ (since k is a real number and p is positive, assuming all variables are positive)

Now, recall that S = √k / p. Substitute k = p³:

S = √(p³) / p = p^(3/2) / p = p^(1/2) = √p

Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me check my steps again to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting from equation 2: ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then x = √(k/a), etc. Then equation 3 leads to S = √k / p. Then equation 1 gives k² / p = p⁵, leading to k = p³. Then S = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p.

Yes, that seems correct. Let me verify with another approach to be sure.

Alternatively, maybe express a, b, c in terms of k and x, y, z. From equation 2: a = k / x², b = k / y², c = k / z².

Then equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p.

Equation 1 becomes:

a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = (k² / x⁴)x³ + (k² / y⁴)y³ + (k² / z⁴)z³ = k²(1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = k²(1/p) = p⁵.

So k²/p = p⁵ => k² = p⁶ => k = p³.

Then, since a = k / x², b = k / y², c = k / z².

So √a + √b + √c = √(k/x²) + √(k/y²) + √(k/z²) = √k(1/x + 1/y + 1/z) = √k*(1/p) = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = √p.

Same result. So that seems correct.

Therefore, the answer is √p. But wait, the problem says ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. 2/3"". Wait, maybe there's a typo here? The user wrote ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p.\\frac{2}{3}"". Maybe it's supposed to be a fraction or something else? But according to the solution, it's √p. Maybe the user made a typo. Alternatively, maybe I made an error.

Wait, let me check again.

From equation 1, after substituting, we had:

k² / p = p⁵ => k² = p⁶ => k = p³. Then S = √k / p = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p. So yes, √p.

But the user wrote ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. 2/3"". Maybe the user meant to say ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p, and the answer is 2/3 of something""? But according to my calculations, the answer is √p. Maybe the user made a mistake in writing the problem, or there's an error in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I missed a step.

Wait, let me check the equations again:

1. a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵

2. ax² = by² = cz²

3. 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p

Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. The user's text ends with ""in terms of p.\\frac{2}{3}"". Maybe that's supposed to be a fraction or a different expression. But according to the steps, the answer is √p.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write ""Express √a + √b + √c in terms of p, and the answer is 2/3 p^something"". But according to my solution, it's √p. Let me check once again.

Wait, let's go back. When I had k = p³, then S = √k / p = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p. Yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the equation 3. If equation 3 was supposed to be 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p^(1/3) or something else, but according to the given, it's 1/p. So unless there's a miscalculation, the answer should be √p.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the substitution. Let me check equation 1 again.

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵.

From equation 2, x = √(k/a), so x³ = (k/a)^(3/2). Then a²x³ = a²*(k/a)^(3/2) = a²*(k^(3/2)/a^(3/2)) = a^(1/2)*k^(3/2). Similarly for the other terms. So the sum is k^(3/2)(√a + √b + √c) = p⁵. Then since S = √a + √b + √c = √k/p, substituting gives k^(3/2)*(√k/p) = p⁵ => k^(2)/p = p⁵ => k² = p⁶ => k = p³. Then S = √(p³)/p = √p. Correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a different approach. Let me try to use variables substitution.

Let me set ax² = by² = cz² = k, so x = √(k/a), y = √(k/b), z = √(k/c). Then equation 3:

1/√(k/a) + 1/√(k/b) + 1/√(k/c) = 1/p

Which simplifies to √(a/k) + √(b/k) + √(c/k) = 1/p

Factor out √(1/k):

√(1/k)(√a + √b + √c) = 1/p

So S = √a + √b + √c = √k / p

Equation 1:

a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = a^(1/2)k^(3/2) + b^(1/2)k^(3/2) + c^(1/2)k^(3/2) = k^(3/2)(√a + √b + √c) = k^(3/2)*S = p⁵

But S = √k / p, so substituting:

k^(3/2)*(√k / p) = k² / p = p⁵ => k² = p⁶ => k = p³

Then S = √(p³)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2) = √p

Same result. So unless there's a miscalculation here, the answer should be √p. Maybe the user's mention of 2/3 was a typo or extra information. Alternatively, perhaps the problem was different, like with exponents 2/3, but according to the given equations, it's √p.

Wait, let me check with numbers. Suppose p = 4. Let's see if the answer makes sense.

If p = 4, then according to the answer, √a + √b + √c = √4 = 2.

Let me see if this works. Let's choose k = p³ = 64. Then S = √64 / 4 = 8/4 = 2, which matches.

Now check equation 3: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/4. Since x = √(k/a) = √(64/a) = 8/√a, so 1/x = √a/8. Similarly, 1/y = √b/8, 1/z = √c/8. So sum: (√a + √b + √c)/8 = 1/4 => (√a + √b + √c) = 2, which matches.

Equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = a²*(8/√a)^3 + b²*(8/√b)^3 + c²*(8/√c)^3 = a²*(512 / a^(3/2)) + same for others = 512 a^(1/2) + 512 b^(1/2) + 512 c^(1/2) = 512*(√a + √b + √c) = 512*2 = 1024. But p⁵ = 4⁵ = 1024. So that works. So the answer holds in this case.

Therefore, the answer is √p. The user's mention of 2/3 might be a red herring or a typo, but according to the solution steps and numerical check, the answer is √p. Therefore, I will go with √p as the solution.

3. \\(\\frac{1}{x} + \\frac{1}{y} + \\frac{1}{z} = \\frac{1}{p}\\)

We need to express \\(\\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} + \\sqrt{c}\\) in terms of \\(p\\).

First, we denote the common value of \\(ax^2\\), \\(by^2\\), and \\(cz^2\\) as \\(k\\). Thus, we have:

From this, we can express \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) as:

","Okay, let's try to figure out how to express √a + √b + √c in terms of p. Hmm, we have three equations here. Let me start by looking at them one by one and see how they might connect.

First equation: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p⁵. That seems complicated. The second equation says ax² = by² = cz². That looks like all those terms are equal to each other. Maybe I can set them equal to some common variable? Let's say ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, we can express a, b, and c in terms of k and x, y, z. So, a = k/x², b = k/y², c = k/z². That might help substitute into the first equation.

Third equation: 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Maybe if I can express x, y, z in terms of p, that would help. But how?

Starting with the second equation, if ax² = by² = cz² = k, then we can write x, y, z in terms of k and a, b, c. Wait, but maybe it's better to set that common value as k and then express a, b, c in terms of x, y, z. Let's try that. So:

From ax² = k, we get a = k/x². Similarly, b = k/y², c = k/z². Then, substitute these into the first equation. Let's see:

a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = (k²/x⁴)x³ + (k²/y⁴)y³ + (k²/z⁴)z³ = k²/x + k²/y + k²/z = k²(1/x + 1/y + 1/z). But from the third equation, 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. So substituting that in, we get k²*(1/p) = p⁵. Therefore, k² = p⁶, so k = p³ (since we can assume k is positive, maybe? Not sure, but let's take the positive root).

So k = p³. Therefore, a = k/x² = p³/x², similarly b = p³/y², c = p³/z².

Now, we need to find √a + √b + √c. Let's express that in terms of x, y, z and k. Since a = p³/x², then √a = √(p³/x²) = (p^(3/2))/x. Similarly, √b = (p^(3/2))/y, √c = (p^(3/2))/z. So √a + √b + √c = p^(3/2)(1/x + 1/y + 1/z). But from the third equation, 1/x + 1/y + 1/z = 1/p. Therefore, √a + √b + √c = p^(3/2)*(1/p) = p^(3/2 - 1) = p^(1/2) = √p. Wait, is that right?

Wait, hold on. Let me check again. √a = sqrt(p³/x²) = sqrt(p³)/sqrt(x²) = p^(3/2)/x. Similarly for the others. Then sum them up: p^(3/2)(1/x + 1/y + 1/z). And 1/x +1/y +1/z = 1/p. So p^(3/2)*(1/p) = p^(3/2 -1) = p^(1/2). So √a + √b + √c = √p. Is that the answer? But wait, the problem says to express it in terms of p, and the answer is √p. But maybe I made a mistake here?

Wait, let's check the steps again. Starting from the second equation, ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, a = k/x², so √a = sqrt(k)/x. Similarly, √b = sqrt(k)/y, √c = sqrt(k)/z. Then, √a + √b + √c = sqrt(k)(1/x + 1/y + 1/z). But 1/x +1/y +1/z = 1/p, so sqrt(k)/p. From earlier, we found that k = p³. Therefore, sqrt(k) = p^(3/2). So sqrt(k)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2). So √a + √b + √c = sqrt(p). That seems straightforward. But the problem mentions ""Express in terms of p"", and the answer is sqrt(p). But maybe the answer is p^(1/3) or something else? Let me double-check.

Wait, let's check if all steps are correct. Starting with ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, a = k/x², so √a = sqrt(k)/x. Then sum of √a + √b + √c is sqrt(k)(1/x + 1/y + 1/z). From equation 3, 1/x +1/y +1/z = 1/p. So that's sqrt(k)/p. Then, from equation 1, substituting a, b, c into equation 1 gives a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p^5. Let's verify that.

a²x³ = (k²/x⁴)x³ = k²/x. Similarly for the others. So sum is k²(1/x +1/y +1/z) = k²*(1/p) = p^5. Therefore, k² = p^6, so k = p^3. Then sqrt(k) = p^(3/2). Therefore, sqrt(k)/p = p^(3/2 -1) = p^(1/2). So yes, the answer is sqrt(p). Hmm. That seems too straightforward, but maybe it's correct.

Wait, but the problem is given in three equations. Let me check if there are any dependencies or constraints I missed. For example, are x, y, z arbitrary variables, or are they related in some way? The problem doesn't specify, so perhaps we can solve in terms of p regardless of x, y, z. But according to the equations, x, y, z are related through the second and third equations.

Wait, in the third equation, 1/x +1/y +1/z = 1/p. So x, y, z are related by this equation. But in the second equation, ax² = by² = cz². So even though x, y, z can vary as long as they satisfy 1/x +1/y +1/z = 1/p, the expression √a + √b + √c only depends on p. That suggests that regardless of the specific values of x, y, z (as long as they satisfy the equations), √a + √b + √c is fixed in terms of p. So the answer is sqrt(p). Hmm.

Wait, but let me check with another approach to confirm. Let me assume that a, b, c are variables, and x, y, z are variables related by the equations. Maybe there's a different way to approach this.

Suppose we set ax² = by² = cz² = k. Then, as before, a = k/x², b = k/y², c = k/z². Then, equation 1 becomes (k²/x⁴)x³ + (k²/y⁴)y³ + (k²/z⁴)z³ = k²/x + k²/y + k²/z = k²(1/x +1/y +1/z) = p^5. But from equation 3, 1/x +1/y +1/z = 1/p. Therefore, k²*(1/p) = p^5, so k² = p^6, so k = p^3. Then, a = p^3/x², b = p^3/y², c = p^3/z². Then, √a + √b + √c = (p^(3/2))/x + (p^(3/2))/y + (p^(3/2))/z = p^(3/2)*(1/x +1/y +1/z) = p^(3/2)*(1/p) = p^(1/2). So same result.

Alternatively, maybe we can use substitution. Let me try to set variables. Let me denote t = ax² = by² = cz². Then, x = sqrt(t/a), y = sqrt(t/b), z = sqrt(t/c). Then, plug into equation 3: 1/x +1/y +1/z = sqrt(a/t) + sqrt(b/t) + sqrt(c/t) = (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(t) = 1/p. So sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(t)/p. Now, let's find t from equation 1. Equation 1 is a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = p^5. Substitute x, y, z from t:

x = sqrt(t/a), so x³ = t^(3/2)/a^(3/2). Similarly, y³ = t^(3/2)/b^(3/2), z³ = t^(3/2)/c^(3/2). Then, equation 1 becomes:

a²*(t^(3/2)/a^(3/2)) + b²*(t^(3/2)/b^(3/2)) + c²*(t^(3/2)/c^(3/2)) = t^(3/2)(a^(1/2) + b^(1/2) + c^(1/2)) = p^5.

But from equation 3, we have sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(t)/p. Let's denote S = sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c). Then, equation from equation 1 is S * t^(3/2) = p^5. But S = sqrt(t)/p. Therefore:

(sqrt(t)/p) * t^(3/2) = p^5 => (t^(1/2) * t^(3/2))/p = p^5 => t^(2)/p = p^5 => t^2 = p^6 => t = p^3 (assuming t positive).

Then, S = sqrt(t)/p = sqrt(p^3)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2). So again, S = sqrt(p). Therefore, the answer is sqrt(p). So seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe use ratios. Suppose ax² = by² = cz² = k. Let's set x = sqrt(k/a), y = sqrt(k/b), z = sqrt(k/c). Then, equation 3: 1/x +1/y +1/z = sqrt(a/k) + sqrt(b/k) + sqrt(c/k) = (sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c))/sqrt(k) = 1/p. So sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p. Then, equation 1: a²x³ + b²y³ + c²z³ = a²*(k/a)^(3/2) + b²*(k/b)^(3/2) + c²*(k/c)^(3/2) = a^(1/2)k^(3/2) + b^(1/2)k^(3/2) + c^(1/2)k^(3/2) = k^(3/2)(sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c)) = p^5. Substitute sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = sqrt(k)/p into this:

k^(3/2)*(sqrt(k)/p) = p^5 => k^(2)/p = p^5 => k^2 = p^6 => k = p^3. Then, sqrt(k)/p = sqrt(p^3)/p = p^(3/2)/p = p^(1/2). So again, same result.

Therefore, regardless of the approach, it seems that the answer is sqrt(p). So maybe that's the correct answer. But let me check if there's any possible mistake here. For example, is k necessarily positive? The problem didn't specify, but since we have square roots, maybe we assume everything is positive. Therefore, k = p³ is positive, so it's okay.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different form? For example, if we write sqrt(p) as p^(1/2) or p^(1/3)? Wait, but according to the calculations, it's sqrt(p). Let me check with some example numbers. Let's pick p = 2. Then, according to the answer, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) should be sqrt(2). Let's see if that's possible.

Suppose p = 2. Then, from equation 3: 1/x +1/y +1/z = 1/2. Let's assume x = y = z. Then, 3/x = 1/2 => x = 6. Then, from equation 2: ax² = by² = cz². If x = y = z =6, then a = b = c. Let a = b = c = k. Then, equation 1: a²x³ + a²x³ + a²x³ = 3a²x³ = p^5 => 3a²*6³ = 2^5 => 3a²*216 = 32 => 648a² =32 => a² = 32/648 = 4/81 => a = 2/9. Then, sqrt(a) = sqrt(2/9) = sqrt(2)/3. Then, sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) = 3*sqrt(2)/3 = sqrt(2). Which matches the answer. So in this example, it works. So seems correct.

Another example: Let p = 1. Then sqrt(a) + sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) should be 1. Let's set x = y = z. Then, from equation 3: 3/x =1 => x=3. Then, from equation 2: a= b= c= k. Then, equation 1: 3a²*3³ =1^5 => 3a²*27 =1 =>81a²=1 => a=1/9. Then, sqrt(a)=1/3, sum is 1. Correct.

Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(p). So I think that's the correct answer. Maybe the problem had a typo, but according to the given equations and the steps, the answer is sqrt(p). So I'll go with that.

**Final Answer**
\\boxed{\\sqrt{p}}

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Hmm, complex integrals can be tricky, but I remember something about residues and the residue theorem. Let me think.

First, the function we're dealing with is 1/(z^5 + 1). The denominator is a polynomial, and the numerator is 1. The integral is a contour integral around a circle of radius 2. Since the radius is 2, which is larger than 1, right? Because the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0 are the fifth roots of -1. Wait, how do we find those roots?

The equation z^5 = -1. So, solving for z, we can write -1 in polar form as e^{iπ + 2πik} for integer k. Then the fifth roots would be e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Let me compute those:

For k = 0: e^{iπ/5}
k = 1: e^{i3π/5}
k = 2: e^{i5π/5} = e^{iπ} = -1
k = 3: e^{i7π/5}
k = 4: e^{i9π/5}

Wait, so these roots are on the unit circle, right? Because their magnitude is 1. So all the poles of the function 1/(z^5 + 1) are inside the contour of radius 2, which includes all the roots. Therefore, to compute the integral, I can use the residue theorem, which states that the integral around the contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function inside the contour.

So, the integral equals 2πi multiplied by the sum of the residues at each of the five poles. Now, each pole is a simple pole because the denominator is z^5 + 1, whose derivative is 5z^4, which is non-zero at each root. So, the residue at a simple pole z = α is given by lim_{z→α} (z - α) * f(z), which for f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1) would be lim_{z→α} (z - α)/(z^5 + 1).

But since z^5 + 1 = (z - α)(z - β)(z - γ)(z - δ)(z - ε), where α, β, γ, δ, ε are the roots, the residue at α would be 1/( (α - β)(α - γ)(α - δ)(α - ε) ). Wait, but this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, I remember that for a function f(z) = 1/g(z), where g(z) has a simple zero at z = α, the residue is 1/g'(α). Let me check that. If g(z) = z^5 + 1, then g'(z) = 5z^4. So, the residue at z = α is 1/(5α^4). But wait, since g(α) = 0, so α^5 = -1. Therefore, α^5 = -1 implies that α^4 = -1/α. Therefore, the residue at α would be 1/(5α^4) = 1/(5*(-1/α)) = -α/5.

So, each residue is -α/5. Therefore, the sum of all residues is the sum of (-α)/5 for each root α. So, sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k)/5 = -1/5 sum_{k=0}^4 α_k.

But what is the sum of the roots α_0 + α_1 + α_2 + α_3 + α_4? The roots of the equation z^5 + 1 = 0 are the roots of z^5 = -1. The polynomial is z^5 + 1, which can be written as z^5 - (-1). For a polynomial z^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} + ... + a_0, the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}. In our case, the polynomial is z^5 + 1, so the coefficient of z^4 is 0. Therefore, the sum of the roots is -0/1 = 0. So, the sum of all roots is zero. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = 0. Therefore, the sum of the residues is -1/5 * 0 = 0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. But let me verify. The sum of the roots of z^5 +1 =0 is indeed zero because the coefficient of z^4 is zero. So, sum of roots is -coefficient of z^4 / coefficient of z^5 = 0. Hence, sum of residues is zero. Therefore, integral is zero.

But let me cross-check this with another approach. Maybe using partial fractions or something else. Alternatively, note that the integral is around a large circle, radius 2. If we can find the residues inside, which we did, and sum them to zero. Alternatively, maybe using the argument principle?

Alternatively, perhaps using symmetry. Since the function 1/(z^5 +1) is a rational function with denominator of degree 5 and numerator of degree 0, the integral around a large circle can be approximated by the behavior at infinity. For large z, 1/(z^5 +1) ≈ 1/z^5. The integral of 1/z^5 around a circle of radius 2 is zero, since the integral of 1/z^n for n ≠ 1 is zero. But since we are using the residue theorem, and all residues sum to zero, then the integral is zero. So both approaches agree.

Wait, but let me check with a specific example. Suppose I compute the residues individually and sum them. Let's take one root, say α = e^{iπ/5}. Then residue at α is -α/5. Similarly for all others. So sum them up: - (e^{iπ/5} + e^{i3π/5} + e^{iπ} + e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5}) /5. But the sum in the numerator is exactly the sum of the roots, which is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero.

Therefore, the answer is zero. But wait, let me check again. Maybe I made a mistake in calculating the residue. Let me recast.

Given f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1). The poles are at z = α where α^5 = -1. Then, the residue at each pole α is lim_{z→α} (z - α)/(z^5 +1). Since z^5 +1 factors as (z - α)(z^4 + αz^3 + α^2z^2 + α^3z + α^4). Therefore, the residue is 1/(z^4 + αz^3 + α^2z^2 + α^3z + α^4) evaluated at z=α. But z=α, so substituting, we get 1/(α^4 + α^4 + α^4 + α^4 + α^4) = 1/(5α^4). Wait, but earlier I thought it's -α/5. Wait, but α^5 = -1 implies that α^4 = -1/α. Therefore, 1/(5α^4) = 1/(5*(-1/α)) = -α/5. So yes, the residue is -α/5. Therefore, sum of residues is sum of -α/5 over all roots. Since sum of roots is zero, sum of residues is zero. Therefore, integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the integral. Let z = 2e^{iθ}, θ from 0 to 2π. Then dz = 2i e^{iθ} dθ. So the integral becomes ∫0^{2π} 1/( (2e^{iθ})^5 +1 ) * 2i e^{iθ} dθ. But this seems complicated. However, note that as the radius is 2, which is large, but the function 1/(z^5 +1) is analytic except at the poles, which are inside the contour. So residue theorem applies. But since the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy's theorem? If the function is analytic inside and on the contour, the integral is zero. But the function 1/(z^5 +1) is not analytic at the poles, which are inside the contour, so Cauchy's theorem doesn't apply.

Alternatively, think of the integral as the sum of residues times 2πi. Since the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. So I think the correct answer is 0. But let me check with an example. Suppose we compute the integral around a circle that includes all poles, and the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero. So yes, this makes sense.

Therefore, after careful consideration, the integral evaluates to zero.

**Final Answer**
\\boxed{0}

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around the circle |z| = 2. Hmm, let's see. I remember that for integrals around closed contours, the residue theorem is really useful. The residue theorem says that the integral is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function inside the contour. So, first, I need to find all the poles of the function 1/(z^5 + 1) inside the circle |z| = 2.

The poles occur where the denominator is zero, so I need to solve z^5 + 1 = 0. That equation is z^5 = -1. The solutions to this are the fifth roots of -1. Since -1 can be written in polar form as e^(iπ), the fifth roots would be e^(iπ + 2πik)/5 for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So, these roots are located at angles π/5, 3π/5, 5π/5 (which is π), 7π/5, and 9π/5. Wait, but all these roots have a magnitude of 1 because they are fifth roots of a number with magnitude 1. So, they all lie on the unit circle, which is inside the circle of radius 2. Therefore, all five poles are inside the contour.

Since all poles are inside, I need to compute the residues at each of these poles and sum them up. Then multiply by 2πi to get the integral. Now, how do I compute the residues for each pole? Each pole is a simple pole because the denominator is a polynomial with simple zeros here. For a simple pole at z = α, the residue of 1/(z^5 +1) is given by 1/(5α^4). Let me verify that.

Yes, if f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1), then near a pole at α, f(z) = 1/(z - α) * g(z), where g(α) = 1/(5α^4), because the derivative of the denominator at α is 5α^4. So, the residue is g(α) = 1/(5α^4). Therefore, the residue at each pole α_k is 1/(5α_k^4).

Now, let's denote the roots as α_k = e^(iπ(1 + 2k)/5) for k = 0,1,2,3,4. So, each α_k is e^(iθ_k) where θ_k = π(1 + 2k)/5. Then, α_k^4 would be e^(i4θ_k) = e^(i4π(1 + 2k)/5). Let's compute that:

For each k, 4θ_k = 4π(1 + 2k)/5 = (4π/5) + (8πk)/5. So, e^(i4θ_k) = e^(i4π/5 + i8πk/5) = e^(i4π/5)e^(i8πk/5). But e^(i8πk/5) is just e^(i2π(4k/5)), which is a root of unity. However, since k is an integer from 0 to 4, 4k/5 mod 1 will cycle through different values. But perhaps there's a way to relate these residues.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute the sum of residues without calculating each one individually. Let me think. Since all poles are roots of z^5 +1 =0, and we know that the sum of residues of a rational function with poles inside a contour is related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Wait, there's a formula for the sum of residues of 1/P(z) where P(z) is a polynomial. Specifically, if P(z) has simple roots α_1, α_2, ..., α_n, then the sum of residues is (sum of 1/(P'(α_j))) for each j. But in our case, the sum of residues is (sum over k=0 to 4 of 1/(5α_k^4)) as we found earlier.

But maybe there's a relation between the roots of z^5 +1 and their residues. Let's see. Let's denote the roots as α_0, α_1, α_2, α_3, α_4. Then, z^5 +1 = product_{k=0}^4 (z - α_k). Then, the derivative of P(z) = z^5 +1 is P'(z) = 5z^4, so P'(α_j) = 5α_j^4. Therefore, the residue at α_j is 1/P'(α_j) = 1/(5α_j^4), which matches our previous result.

Now, the sum of residues is sum_{j=0}^4 1/(5α_j^4) = (1/5) sum_{j=0}^4 1/α_j^4. But 1/α_j is the complex conjugate of α_j since |α_j| =1. However, since the roots are on the unit circle, 1/α_j = conjugate(α_j). But maybe we can relate the sum of 1/α_j^4 to something else.

Alternatively, notice that the roots satisfy the equation z^5 = -1. So, for each root α_j, α_j^5 = -1. Therefore, α_j^5 = -1, which implies that α_j^4 = -1/α_j. Because α_j^5 = -1, divide both sides by α_j: α_j^4 = -1/α_j. Therefore, 1/α_j^4 = -α_j. Therefore, sum_{j=0}^4 1/α_j^4 = sum_{j=0}^4 (-α_j) = - sum_{j=0}^4 α_j.

So, the sum of residues is (1/5) * (- sum_{j=0}^4 α_j). Now, the sum of the roots of the polynomial z^5 +1 is equal to zero, because in the polynomial z^5 +0z^4 +0z^3 +0z^2 +0z +1, the coefficient of z^4 is zero. By Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is -coefficient of z^4 divided by coefficient of z^5, which is 0/1 =0. Therefore, sum_{j=0}^4 α_j =0. Hence, sum_{j=0}^4 1/α_j^4 = -0 =0. Therefore, the sum of residues is (1/5)*0 =0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi *0 =0.

Wait, that's interesting. So even though there are poles inside the contour, the sum of their residues is zero, so the integral is zero. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the reasoning.

Wait, let's verify the step where I said that α_j^4 = -1/α_j. Since α_j^5 = -1, then α_j^4 = -1/α_j. Yes, because α_j^5 = -1 => α_j^4 = -1/α_j. Therefore, 1/α_j^4 = -α_j. So, sum 1/α_j^4 = sum (-α_j) = - sum α_j. And sum α_j is zero because they are roots of z^5 +1, which has no z^4 term, so sum α_j =0. Therefore, sum residues is zero. Therefore, integral is zero. So, the answer is zero. But wait, the problem says to evaluate the integral, so is zero correct?

Alternatively, maybe there's an error here. Let me check again. Let's consider another approach. Let's compute the integral using the residue theorem. The function is 1/(z^5 +1). The poles are the fifth roots of -1, which are all inside |z|=2. So, sum of residues times 2πi. If the sum of residues is zero, then integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to compute the integral by considering the residue at infinity? But since the contour is |z|=2, which is a large circle, but actually, the function 1/(z^5 +1) has a pole at infinity only if the degree of the denominator is greater than the numerator. Wait, the function 1/(z^5 +1) as z approaches infinity behaves like 1/z^5, so the residue at infinity is zero. Therefore, the integral around |z|=2 is equal to the integral around |z|=∞ minus the residue at infinity times 2πi. But since the residue at infinity is zero, the integral around |z|=2 is equal to the integral around |z|=∞, which is zero? Wait, maybe not.

Wait, the residue at infinity is defined as the residue of -1/z^2 f(1/z) at z=0. For f(z) =1/(z^5 +1), then f(1/z) =1/(1/z^5 +1) = z^5/(1 + z^5). Then, -1/z^2 f(1/z) = -1/z^2 * z^5/(1 + z^5) = -z^3/(1 + z^5). The residue at z=0 of this function is the coefficient of z^{-1} in the Laurent series. But the function is -z^3/(1 + z^5). Let's expand this as a power series. Let's write 1/(1 + z^5) = 1 - z^5 + z^{10} - z^{15} + ... Then, multiplying by -z^3, we get -z^3 + z^8 - z^{13} + ... So, the Laurent series has no z^{-1} term, so the residue at infinity is zero. Therefore, the integral over |z|=2 is equal to the integral over |z|=∞, which is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. So, that's another way to confirm.

But wait, the residue at infinity formula says that the integral around a large circle is equal to 2πi times the residue at infinity. But since the residue at infinity is zero, then the integral is zero. So, this seems to confirm the first method.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the integral directly by substitution. Let me try that. Let’s consider the substitution w = z^5 +1. But that might not help. Alternatively, note that the integrand is 1/(z^5 +1). If we parametrize the contour as z = 2e^{iθ}, θ from 0 to 2π, then the integral becomes ∫_{0}^{2π} [1/( (2e^{iθ})^5 +1 ) ] * 2i e^{iθ} dθ. But this seems complicated to compute directly.

Alternatively, consider the substitution z = 2e^{iθ}, but I don't think that would simplify things. Alternatively, think about symmetry. The function 1/(z^5 +1) may have some symmetry that causes the integral to cancel out. But since the previous methods both lead to zero, and the residue theorem gives zero, I think the answer is zero.

But wait, let me check with another method. Let's use the residue theorem with the sum of residues. Let me compute the residues individually and sum them up. Let's take one root, say α_0. Then, the residue at α_0 is 1/(5α_0^4). But since α_0^5 = -1, then α_0^4 = -1/α_0. Therefore, residue at α_0 is 1/(5*(-1/α_0)) = -α_0/5. Similarly, residue at α_1 is -α_1/5, and so on. Therefore, the sum of residues is (-1/5)(α_0 + α_1 + α_2 + α_3 + α_4) = (-1/5)(0) =0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi *0 =0. So, this again gives zero.

Therefore, all methods lead to the conclusion that the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. But just to be absolutely sure, let me check with a different approach.

Consider the function f(z) =1/(z^5 +1). If we close the contour, but we already did that. Alternatively, consider the integral over a large circle and relate it to the integral over |z|=2. But since the function is meromorphic inside the large circle, and the residue at infinity is zero, the integral over all such circles is zero. Therefore, the integral over |z|=2 is zero.

Alternatively, think of the function 1/(z^5 +1) and note that it's a rational function with degree of denominator higher than numerator, so as |z| approaches infinity, f(z) ~ 1/z^5, so the integral over a large circle is zero because the integral over 1/z^5 is zero. Therefore, the integral over |z|=2 is zero.

Therefore, all methods confirm that the integral is zero. So, the answer is zero. Therefore, the final answer is zero.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Hmm, let's start by recalling some complex analysis. Since the contour is a closed curve, maybe I can use the residue theorem. The residue theorem says that the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function at its poles inside the contour.

First, I need to find all the poles of the function 1/(z^5 + 1). The poles occur where the denominator is zero, so solving z^5 + 1 = 0. That gives me the roots of z^5 = -1. The roots of this equation are the fifth roots of -1. To find these roots, I can express -1 in polar form as e^{iπ + 2πik} for integers k. Then the fifth roots would be e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So there are five roots, each separated by an angle of 2π/5.

Let me write them out explicitly:

z_k = e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.

Calculating these, for k=0: z_0 = e^{iπ/5}, which is a root on the unit circle at angle π/5. Similarly, k=1: e^{i3π/5}, k=2: e^{i5π/5} = e^{iπ} = -1, k=3: e^{i7π/5}, k=4: e^{i9π/5}. So these are all the fifth roots of -1.

Now, since the contour is a circle of radius 2, all these roots are inside the contour because their absolute value is 1, which is less than 2. So all five poles are inside the contour. Therefore, by the residue theorem, the integral is 2πi times the sum of the residues at each of these poles.

So I need to compute the sum of the residues of 1/(z^5 + 1) at each of the five roots. Let's recall that for a simple pole at z = α, the residue of f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1) is given by:

Res_{z=α} f(z) = lim_{z→α} (z - α)/(z^5 + 1)

Since z^5 + 1 can be factored as (z - α)(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4), because it's a geometric series for a fifth-degree polynomial. Wait, actually, z^5 + 1 = (z + 1)(z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1), but maybe that's not helpful here. Alternatively, since we know that z^5 + 1 has simple poles at each root α, the residue at each pole α is 1/(5α^4). Wait, let me verify that.

If f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1), then f(z) can be written as 1/((z - α)(z - β)(z - γ)(z - δ)(z - ε)) where α, β, γ, δ, ε are the roots. Then, the residue at α is 1/( (α - β)(α - γ)(α - δ)(α - ε) ). Hmm, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, since z^5 + 1 = 0 at z = α, so z^5 = -1. Then, the derivative of z^5 + 1 at z = α is 5α^4. So by the formula for residues of rational functions with simple poles, the residue is 1/(5α^4). Therefore, Res_{z=α} f(z) = 1/(5α^4).

But wait, let me check that. The general formula for a function f(z) = g(z)/h(z) with a simple pole at z = α where g(α) ≠ 0 and h'(α) ≠ 0 is Res_{z=α} f(z) = g(α)/h'(α). In this case, g(z) = 1 and h(z) = z^5 + 1. So h'(z) = 5z^4. Therefore, Res_{z=α} f(z) = 1/(5α^4). That seems right.

So for each root α of z^5 + 1 = 0, the residue is 1/(5α^4). Therefore, the sum of residues is the sum over k=0 to 4 of 1/(5α_k^4). Therefore, the integral is 2πi times this sum.

Now, let's compute the sum S = sum_{k=0}^4 1/(5α_k^4). Let's factor out the 1/5, so S = (1/5) sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4.

But note that α_k^5 = -1 for each root α_k. Therefore, 1/α_k^4 = α_k. Because α_k^5 = -1 implies α_k^5 = -1 ⇒ α_k = (-1)^{1/5}, but more importantly, 1/α_k^4 = α_k^{(5 - 4)} = α_k^1 = α_k. Wait, let's see:

Since α_k^5 = -1, then α_k^4 = (-1)/α_k. Therefore, 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Wait, that seems conflicting. Let's check:

If α_k^5 = -1, then α_k^4 = (-1)/α_k. Therefore, 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. So 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4 = sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k) = -sum_{k=0}^4 α_k.

Therefore, S = (1/5)(-sum_{k=0}^4 α_k). Therefore, the integral is 2πi * S = 2πi * (-1/5) sum_{k=0}^4 α_k.

Now, sum_{k=0}^4 α_k is the sum of the roots of the equation z^5 + 1 = 0. For a polynomial z^5 + 1 = 0, the sum of the roots is equal to -coefficient of z^4 / coefficient of z^5. Since the polynomial is z^5 + 0z^4 + 0z^3 + 0z^2 + 0z + 1, the sum of the roots is -0/1 = 0. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = 0.

Therefore, S = (1/5)(-0) = 0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Alternatively, maybe there is a mistake in the step where I equate 1/α_k^4 to -α_k. Let me check again:

Given that α_k^5 = -1, then α_k^5 + 1 = 0. Let's solve for 1/α_k^4.

Multiply both sides of α_k^5 = -1 by α_k^4:

α_k^5 * α_k^4 = (-1) * α_k^4 ⇒ α_k^9 = -α_k^4. But this doesn't seem helpful.

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let's express 1/α_k^4 in terms of α_k. Since α_k^5 = -1, then α_k^4 = (-1)/α_k. Therefore, 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. So yes, 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4 = sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k) = -sum_{k=0}^4 α_k. Since the sum of the roots is zero, this sum is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero.

But wait, is the sum of the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0 indeed zero?

Yes, because the polynomial is z^5 + 1, which can be written as z^5 + 0z^4 + 0z^3 + 0z^2 + 0z + 1. The sum of the roots is equal to -coefficient of z^4 divided by coefficient of z^5, which is -0/1 = 0. So that's correct.

Therefore, the sum of residues is zero, so the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is 0.

But wait, let me check with another method. Maybe using symmetry or another theorem.

Alternatively, consider that the function 1/(z^5 + 1) is a rational function where the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator, so by Cauchy's theorem, the integral around a large contour should be zero? Wait, but the contour here is radius 2, which is large enough to include all poles. But the integral is zero because the sum of residues is zero. Hmm.

Alternatively, another approach: consider that the integral over a large circle with radius R, as R approaches infinity, the integral tends to zero because the integrand is O(1/R^5), and the length of the contour is 2πR, so the integral is O(1/R^4) which goes to zero. Therefore, by the residue theorem, the integral over a large circle is zero, which implies that the sum of residues inside is zero. But in our case, the sum of residues inside the circle of radius 2 is zero, so the integral is zero. Therefore, this confirms the result.

Alternatively, if I parametrize the integral. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, note that the function is meromorphic, and if the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero. So maybe the answer is zero.

But let me check with a specific example. Suppose I take a simpler case: integral around a large circle of 1/(z^5 + 1). Then, the integral should be zero because the sum of residues is zero. But if I take a smaller circle, say radius 1, which only contains the pole at -1, then the residue at -1 would be 1/(5*(-1)^4) = 1/5. So the integral would be 2πi*(1/5). But in our case, the circle of radius 2 contains all poles, so the sum of residues is zero, hence the integral is zero. That seems correct.

Therefore, the final answer is 0. So the integral is zero.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Hmm, let me think. I remember that for complex integrals, especially around closed contours, the residue theorem is really useful. The residue theorem says that the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function at all singularities inside the contour. 

First, I need to find the singularities of the function 1/(z^5 + 1). The denominator is z^5 + 1, so the poles occur where z^5 = -1. The solutions to z^5 = -1 are the fifth roots of -1. Let me recall that the nth roots of a complex number z = r e^{iθ} are given by r^{1/n} e^{i(θ + 2πk)/n} for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1. 

So here, z^5 = -1. The modulus of -1 is 1, and its argument is π (since it's on the negative real axis). Therefore, the fifth roots will have modulus 1^{1/5} = 1 and arguments (π + 2πk)/5 for k = 0 to 4. That gives us five poles at angles π/5, 3π/5, 5π/5=π, 7π/5, and 9π/5. All these roots have modulus 1, so they lie on the unit circle. Since our contour is a circle of radius 2, which is larger than 1, all these poles are inside the contour. 

Therefore, by the residue theorem, the integral is 2πi times the sum of the residues at each of these five poles. 

Now, I need to compute the residues at each of these poles. Since each pole is simple (the denominator has a single root there, and the derivative of the denominator at that point is non-zero), the residue at each pole z_k is given by lim_{z→z_k} (z - z_k)/(z^5 + 1). Alternatively, for a simple pole at z_k, the residue is 1/(5 z_k^4), because the derivative of the denominator z^5 + 1 is 5 z^4, so by the formula for residues at simple poles: Res(f, z_k) = 1 / (5 z_k^4). 

Let me verify that. If f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1) and z_k is a root of z^5 + 1 = 0, then near z_k, we can write z^5 + 1 = (z - z_k) g(z), where g(z_k) ≠ 0. Then, the residue is 1/g(z_k). To find g(z_k), we can write z^5 + 1 = (z - z_k)(z^4 + z^3 z_k + z^2 z_k^2 + z z_k^3 + z_k^4). Therefore, g(z) = z^4 + z^3 z_k + z^2 z_k^2 + z z_k^3 + z_k^4, so g(z_k) = z_k^4 + z_k^4 + z_k^4 + z_k^4 + z_k^4 = 5 z_k^4. Therefore, the residue is 1/(5 z_k^4). That seems right. 

So, the residues at each pole z_k are 1/(5 z_k^4). Therefore, the sum of residues is sum_{k=0}^4 [1/(5 z_k^4)]. Let me compute that sum. Let's denote z_k as the roots of z^5 = -1. So, z_k^5 = -1. Then, z_k^4 = z_k^4. But since z_k^5 = -1, we can write z_k^4 = (-1)/z_k. Therefore, z_k^4 = -1/z_k. So, substituting back into the residue expression: 1/(5 z_k^4) = 1/(5*(-1/z_k)) = z_k/(5*(-1)) = -z_k/(5). 

Wait, that's interesting. So each residue is -z_k/5. Therefore, the sum of residues is sum_{k=0}^4 (-z_k)/5 = -1/5 sum_{k=0}^4 z_k. 

But the sum of the roots of the polynomial z^5 + 1 = 0. Wait, z^5 + 1 = 0 is a fifth-degree polynomial. The sum of the roots of a polynomial a_n z^n + ... + a_0 is -a_{n-1}/a_n. In this case, the polynomial is z^5 + 1, so the sum of the roots is -0/1 = 0. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 z_k = 0. 

Therefore, the sum of the residues is -1/5 * 0 = 0. 

Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0. 

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the residue calculation. Let me think again. If z_k is a root of z^5 = -1, then z_k^5 = -1. So, z_k^4 = z_k^4. But since z_k^5 = -1, then z_k^5 + 1 = 0 => z_k^5 = -1. Therefore, z_k^4 = -1/z_k. Then, 1/(5 z_k^4) = 1/(5*(-1/z_k)) = -z_k/(5). So yes, each residue is -z_k/5. Summing over all k, sum_{k=0}^4 (-z_k)/5 = -1/5 sum_{k=0}^4 z_k. As the polynomial is z^5 + 1, the sum of roots is zero (since coefficient of z^4 is zero). So sum z_k = 0, hence sum residues = 0. Therefore, integral is zero. 

But wait, is that correct? Let me think of another approach. Maybe using Cauchy's theorem or something else. 

Alternatively, since the function 1/(z^5 + 1) is analytic everywhere except at the poles inside the contour. But according to the residue theorem, the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues. If the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the integral of a rational function around a large enough contour. For example, if the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator, then the integral might be zero. But here, the degree of the denominator is 5, and the numerator is 1 (degree 0), so the degree of the denominator is higher. Wait, but in complex analysis, for large contours, the integral of 1/(z^n + 1) around a large circle behaves like 0, but here n=5. Wait, but our contour is not a large circle in terms of infinity, but radius 2. However, the previous reasoning using residues seems to hold. 

Alternatively, perhaps I can parametrize the integral, but that would be complicated. Alternatively, using symmetry. The function 1/(z^5 + 1) is not an even or odd function, but maybe over the circle, integrating around, but I don't think that helps. 

Wait, another thought: if I consider the integral over a large contour, say radius R approaching infinity, then the integral would be 2πi times the sum of residues inside that contour. Since all poles are inside, the sum is zero, so the integral would approach zero as R approaches infinity. But our contour is radius 2, which is finite, but the previous calculation suggests that the integral is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the integral directly by expanding 1/(z^5 + 1) into a Laurent series and integrating term by term. But that seems complicated. 

Alternatively, perhaps using partial fractions. But partial fractions for a fifth-degree polynomial would be messy. 

Wait, another idea: since all poles are inside the contour and the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero. But let me check with an example. Suppose I take a simpler integral, say 1/(z^2 + 1) around a circle of radius 2. The poles are at i and -i, residues are 1/(2i) and -1/(2i), sum is zero, integral is zero. Wait, but actually, the sum of residues is 1/(2i) + (-1)/(2i) = 0. So the integral is zero. But wait, in reality, 1/(z^2 + 1) integrated around a circle containing both poles is 2πi*(sum of residues) = 0. So yes, that works. So in that case, the integral is zero. So maybe in our case, even though there are five poles, their residues sum to zero, so the integral is zero. 

But let me verify the residue sum again. Each residue is -z_k/5, sum over five roots. The sum of z_k is zero, so sum of residues is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe I should compute one residue explicitly to check. Let's take a specific pole, say z = e^{iπ/5}. Then, z^5 = -1, so z^5 = -1. Then, the residue at z is 1/(5 z^4). Let's compute z^4. Since z = e^{iπ/5}, z^4 = e^{i4π/5}. Then, 1/(5 z^4) = 1/(5 e^{i4π/5}) = e^{-i4π/5}/5. Similarly, for each pole, the residue is e^{-iθ_k}/5, where θ_k is the argument of the pole. Then, summing all residues: sum_{k=0}^4 e^{-iθ_k}/5. The sum of e^{-iθ_k} over the roots. But the roots are equally spaced around the circle, separated by 2π/5. So θ_k = (2k + 1)π/5 for k=0,...,4. Therefore, e^{-iθ_k} = e^{-i(2k + 1)π/5}. The sum over k=0 to 4 of e^{-i(2k + 1)π/5} is equal to e^{-iπ/5} sum_{k=0}^4 e^{-i2πk/5}. The sum sum_{k=0}^4 e^{-i2πk/5} is a geometric series with ratio e^{-i2π/5}, which is a fifth root of unity. The sum is (1 - e^{-i2π})/(1 - e^{-i2π/5}) = 0, since e^{-i2π} = 1. Therefore, the sum is zero. Hence, the sum of residues is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

Therefore, the answer should be zero. 

But wait, just to be thorough, let me check with another method. Let me consider the integral over the circle |z|=2. Let's parametrize z = 2e^{iθ}, θ from 0 to 2π. Then, dz = 2i e^{iθ} dθ. The integral becomes ∫0^{2π} [1/( (2e^{iθ})^5 + 1 ) ] * 2i e^{iθ} dθ. Simplify the denominator: (2e^{iθ})^5 = 32 e^{i5θ}, so denominator is 32 e^{i5θ} + 1. Therefore, the integral becomes 2i ∫0^{2π} [e^{iθ}/(32 e^{i5θ} + 1)] dθ. 

This seems complicated, but perhaps I can use substitution. Let me set φ = θ, then the integrand is e^{iφ}/(32 e^{i5φ} + 1). Alternatively, multiply numerator and denominator by e^{-i5φ} to get [e^{iφ} e^{-i5φ}]/[32 + e^{-i5φ}] = e^{-i4φ}/(32 + e^{-i5φ}). Not sure if that helps. 

Alternatively, consider that the integral is of the form ∫ e^{iθ}/(A e^{i5θ} + B) dθ. Maybe substitution u = e^{i5θ}, but that might not work. 

Alternatively, note that the integral is equal to the sum of residues, which we already computed as zero. So perhaps this parametrization approach is not helpful here. 

Alternatively, consider that the integral is zero because the function is analytic everywhere outside the poles, but since the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero. 

Alternatively, think about the function f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1). If we consider the integral over a large contour, say radius R, then by the residue theorem, the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues inside, which is zero. But by the estimation lemma, for large R, |f(z)| ≤ 1/(R^5 - 1) ≈ 1/R^5, so the integral over |z|=R is bounded by 2πR * 1/R^5 = 2π/R^4, which tends to zero as R→∞. Therefore, the integral over the large contour is zero. But our contour is radius 2, which is finite, but maybe by some extension? Wait, no. The integral over radius 2 is not necessarily the same as the limit as R→∞. However, if the function is analytic in the region outside the unit circle, but our function has poles at the roots of z^5 +1 =0, which are on the unit circle. So the function is analytic everywhere except at those poles. Therefore, the integral over any contour that encloses all poles is 2πi times the sum of residues, which is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

Therefore, after all these checks and considering different approaches, I think the integral is indeed zero. Maybe my initial thought that the sum of residues is zero is correct, so the integral is zero.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral ∮_{|z|=2} 1/(z^5 + 1) dz. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that for integrals around closed contours, especially circles centered at the origin, the residue theorem is really useful. The residue theorem says that the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function inside the contour. 

First, I should figure out where the poles of the function 1/(z^5 + 1) are located. The poles occur when the denominator is zero, so solving z^5 + 1 = 0. That means z^5 = -1. The solutions to this equation are the fifth roots of -1. Since -1 can be written in polar form as e^{iπ}, the fifth roots would be e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So there are five poles, each at angles (π + 2πk)/5 for k from 0 to 4. Let me calculate those angles:

For k=0: (π + 0)/5 = π/5 ≈ 36 degrees
k=1: (π + 2π)/5 = 3π/5 ≈ 108 degrees
k=2: (π + 4π)/5 = π ≈ 180 degrees
k=3: (π + 6π)/5 = 7π/5 ≈ 252 degrees
k=4: (π + 8π)/5 = 9π/5 ≈ 324 degrees

So all these poles lie on the unit circle since their magnitude is 1. The contour given is |z| = 2, which is a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin. Since all the poles are inside this circle (because 1 < 2), the residue theorem tells me that the integral is 2πi times the sum of the residues at all five poles.

Now, I need to compute the residues at each of these poles. Since all the poles are simple poles (because the denominator is z^5 +1 and its derivative is 5z^4, which is non-zero at z^5 = -1), the residue at each pole z = α is given by 1/(5α^4). Let me verify that formula. For a simple pole at z = α, the residue is lim_{z→α} (z - α)f(z). Here, f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1). So, residue = lim_{z→α} (z - α)/(z^5 +1). The denominator can be factored as (z - α)(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4). Therefore, the limit becomes 1/(5α^4) by L’Hospital’s rule or using the general formula for residues at simple poles. So yes, each residue is 1/(5α^4).

But wait, maybe there's a smarter way to compute the sum of the residues without calculating each one individually. Let me think. The function we're integrating is 1/(z^5 +1). If we consider the sum of residues at all poles, that sum should be equal to the residue at infinity or something? Wait, no, the sum of residues of a function over all poles is zero if the function is analytic at infinity. But in this case, since we have a finite number of poles, the sum of residues at all poles is zero? Wait, is that right?

Wait, the residue at infinity is defined as -Res_{z=0} [1/z^2 f(1/z)]. Let me compute that. Let f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1). Then f(1/z) = 1/(1/z^5 +1) = z^5/(1 + z^5). Therefore, 1/z^2 f(1/z) = z^5/(z^2(1 + z^5)) = z^3/(1 + z^5). Then the residue at infinity is -Res_{z=0} [z^3/(1 + z^5)]. Expanding 1/(1 + z^5) as a series, we get z^3(1 - z^5 + z^{10} - ...). The residue at z=0 is the coefficient of z^{-1} term, which is zero because z^3 times (1 - z^5 + ...) gives z^3 - z^8 + ..., so the coefficient of z^{-1} is zero. Therefore, the residue at infinity is zero. So by the residue theorem, the sum of residues at all poles (including the one at infinity) is zero. Therefore, the sum of residues at finite poles is zero. Wait, but that can't be right because we are integrating around a contour that encloses all the poles. Wait, but the residue at infinity is zero, so the sum of residues at finite poles is zero. Therefore, the integral should be zero? But that contradicts the previous thought that the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues. Wait, maybe I'm mixing something up here.

Wait, the residue theorem states that the integral around a closed contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. If all poles are inside the contour, then the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues inside. But if I consider the sum of residues at all poles (including those outside the contour) plus the residue at infinity, it's zero. But in our case, the contour is |z|=2, which includes all finite poles (since they are all inside |z|=1). Therefore, the sum of residues inside the contour is the sum of all residues (since all are inside), and the residue at infinity is zero. Therefore, the integral should be 2πi times the sum of all residues, but according to the residue at infinity being zero, the sum of residues at finite poles is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero? But that seems counterintuitive. Let me check with a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe the function 1/(z^5 +1) doesn't have a pole at infinity? Wait, no, functions with finite poles, when considering the extended complex plane (Riemann sphere), have a residue at infinity. The residue at infinity is defined as -Res_{z=0} [1/z^2 f(1/z)]. As computed earlier, this is zero. Therefore, the sum of residues at all finite poles plus the residue at infinity is zero. Therefore, the sum of residues at finite poles is zero. Therefore, the integral around any contour enclosing all poles would be zero? But this seems odd because the integrand is not identically zero. Wait, but maybe the function is not entire, and the residues sum to zero. Let me check with a simpler case. For example, 1/(z^2 +1). The poles are at i and -i, residues are each 1/(2i) and -1/(2i). Sum is zero, and the residue at infinity is zero. Therefore, the integral around a large contour encircling both poles would be zero. But if you take a contour that doesn't encircle any poles, the integral is zero. If you take a contour that encircles, say, only i, then the integral is 2πi*(1/(2i)) = π. So in that case, the integral is not zero. Therefore, in our case, if the sum of residues is zero, then integrating around a contour that encloses all poles would give zero. But is that correct?

Wait, let's compute the sum of residues explicitly. Let me compute the residues at each pole. Let the poles be α_k = e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k=0,1,2,3,4. Then the residue at each α_k is 1/(5α_k^4). Let me compute the sum of residues:

Sum_{k=0}^4 [1/(5α_k^4)] = (1/5) Sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4.

But since α_k^5 = -1, we can write α_k^4 = α_k^{-1} because α_k^5 = -1 => α_k^4 = -1/α_k. Wait, is that right? Let's see:

If α_k^5 = -1, then α_k^4 = α_k^{-1} * (-1). Wait, actually, α_k^4 = α_k^{-1} * (-1). Because α_k^5 = -1 => α_k^4 = (-1)/α_k. So 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Therefore, Sum_{k=0}^4 [1/(5α_k^4)] = (1/5) Sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k) = (-1/5) Sum_{k=0}^4 α_k.

Now, the sum of the roots of the equation z^5 +1 =0. Wait, the roots are the fifth roots of -1, which are the same as the roots of z^5 = -1. The sum of the roots of a polynomial equation z^5 + c =0 is zero, since the coefficient of z^4 is zero. Therefore, the sum of the α_k is zero. Therefore, the sum of residues is (-1/5)*0 = 0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi*0 = 0. So that's the answer?

But wait, that seems strange. Let me verify with a different approach. Let's consider the integral ∮_{|z|=2} 1/(z^5 +1) dz. If I consider the substitution w = 1/z, then the integral becomes ∮_{|w|=1/2} 1/( (1/w)^5 +1 ) * (-1/w^2) dw. Simplifying, that's ∮_{|w|=1/2} 1/(1 + w^5) * (-1/w^2) dw. The integral is equal to -∮_{|w|=1/2} 1/(w^2(1 + w^5)) dw. Now, the function inside the integral is 1/(w^2(1 + w^5)). The poles of this function are at w=0 (double pole) and the roots of 1 + w^5 =0, which are w = e^{iπ(2k+1)/5} for k=0,1,2,3,4. These roots are on the unit circle, but our contour is |w|=1/2, so none of these roots are inside the contour. Therefore, the integral is equal to 2πi times the residue at w=0. Let's compute the residue at w=0.

The residue at w=0 of 1/(w^2(1 + w^5)) is the coefficient of w^{-1} in the Laurent series expansion. Let's expand 1/(1 + w^5) around w=0 as 1 - w^5 + w^{10} - ... So multiplying by 1/w^2, we get 1/w^2 - w^3 + w^8 - ... Therefore, the coefficient of w^{-1} is zero. Therefore, the residue at w=0 is zero. Therefore, the integral is -2πi*0 = 0. Therefore, the original integral is zero. So both methods agree.

But just to make sure, maybe I made a mistake in assuming that the sum of the residues is zero. Let me compute one residue explicitly. Take α = e^{iπ/5}. Then the residue at α is 1/(5α^4). Let's compute α^4: since α^5 = -1, α^4 = -1/α. Therefore, 1/(5α^4) = -α/5. Similarly, for each α_k, the residue is -α_k/5. Therefore, the sum of residues is -1/5 Sum_{k=0}^4 α_k. But the sum of α_k is zero, as they are roots of z^5 +1 =0 (which has no z^4 term), so the sum is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. So all methods lead to the same conclusion.

Therefore, the value of the integral is zero. But the problem statement mentions ""where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin,"" and the initial thought was to use residues, but all residues sum to zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. However, the problem might expect a different answer. Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the residue calculation?

Wait, let's check again. Residue at α is 1/(5α^4). But since α^5 = -1, α^4 = α^{-1}*(-1). So 1/α^4 = -α. Therefore, residue is 1/(5α^4) = -α/5. Therefore, each residue is -α/5. Then, sum over k=0 to 4: -1/5 Sum_{k=0}^4 α_k. As the sum of α_k is zero, the total residue is zero. Hence, the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. But maybe the problem expects a different answer? Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe I should use the residue theorem directly. The integral is 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. All poles are inside, and sum of residues is zero. Therefore, integral is zero. Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that the sum of residues is zero. Let me compute one residue numerically. Let's take α = e^{iπ/5}. Compute 1/(5α^4). Let's compute α^4:

α = e^{iπ/5}, so α^4 = e^{i4π/5}. Then 1/(5α^4) = 1/(5e^{i4π/5}) = e^{-i4π/5}/5. Similarly, for the other poles:

α1 = e^{i3π/5}, residue = e^{-i3π/5}/5

α2 = e^{iπ}, residue = e^{-iπ}/5 = -1/5

α3 = e^{i7π/5}, residue = e^{-i7π/5}/5

α4 = e^{i9π/5}, residue = e^{-i9π/5}/5

Summing all residues:

e^{-i4π/5}/5 + e^{-i3π/5}/5 + e^{-iπ}/5 + e^{-i7π/5}/5 + e^{-i9π/5}/5

Let me convert these exponentials to rectangular form.

e^{-i4π/5} = cos(-4π/5) + i sin(-4π/5) = cos(4π/5) - i sin(4π/5) = (-cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5))

Similarly, e^{-i3π/5} = cos(3π/5) - i sin(3π/5) = (-cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5))

e^{-iπ} = cos(-π) + i sin(-π) = -1 + 0i = -1

e^{-i7π/5} = cos(-7π/5) + i sin(-7π/5) = cos(7π/5) - i sin(7π/5) = cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5) [Wait, 7π/5 is equivalent to 7π/5 - 2π = -3π/5, so cos(-3π/5) = cos(3π/5) = -cos(2π/5), sin(-3π/5) = -sin(3π/5) = -sin(2π/5). Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, 7π/5 is 7π/5 - 2π = -3π/5. So e^{-i7π/5} = e^{i3π/5} = cos(3π/5) + i sin(3π/5) = -cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5). Similarly, e^{-i9π/5} = e^{iπ/5} = cos(π/5) + i sin(π/5).

Wait, this is getting a bit messy. Let me compute each term step by step.

First, list all exponentials:

1. e^{-i4π/5}: angle -4π/5 is equivalent to angle 6π/5 (since -4π/5 + 2π = 6π/5). cos(6π/5) = cos(π + π/5) = -cos(π/5), sin(6π/5) = -sin(π/5). So e^{-i4π/5} = -cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

2. e^{-i3π/5}: angle -3π/5 is equivalent to angle 7π/5. cos(7π/5) = cos(π + 2π/5) = -cos(2π/5), sin(7π/5) = -sin(2π/5). So e^{-i3π/5} = -cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5)

3. e^{-iπ} = -1

4. e^{-i7π/5}: angle -7π/5 is equivalent to angle 3π/5. cos(3π/5) = -cos(2π/5), sin(3π/5) = sin(2π/5). So e^{-i7π/5} = -cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5)

5. e^{-i9π/5}: angle -9π/5 is equivalent to angle π/5. cos(π/5) = cos(π/5), sin(π/5) = sin(π/5). So e^{-i9π/5} = cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

Now, sum all these terms:

Term1: -cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)
Term2: -cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5)
Term3: -1
Term4: -cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5)
Term5: cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

Adding Term1 and Term5: (-cos(π/5) + cos(π/5)) + (-i sin(π/5) - i sin(π/5)) = 0 - 2i sin(π/5)

Adding Term2 and Term4: (-cos(2π/5) - cos(2π/5)) + (-i sin(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5)) = -2 cos(2π/5) + 0i

Adding Term3: -1

Total sum: (-2 cos(2π/5) -1) - 2i sin(π/5)

Wait, but this can't be zero. Did I make a mistake in the calculation?

Wait, let's compute each part carefully.

Term1: -cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

Term5: cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

Sum of Term1 + Term5: (-cos(π/5) + cos(π/5)) + (-i sin(π/5) - i sin(π/5)) = 0 - 2i sin(π/5)

Term2: -cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5)

Term4: -cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5)

Sum of Term2 + Term4: (-cos(2π/5) - cos(2π/5)) + (-i sin(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5)) = -2 cos(2π/5) + 0i

Term3: -1

Total sum: (-2 cos(2π/5) -1) + (-2i sin(π/5))

But according to the previous reasoning, the sum should be zero. So this suggests that there's a mistake in my calculations.

Wait, but according to Vieta's formula, the sum of roots of z^5 +1 =0 is zero. The roots are α0, α1, α2, α3, α4. So Sum_{k=0}^4 αk =0. But here, we are summing -αk/5, so Sum -αk/5 = -1/5 Sum αk =0. Therefore, the total residue sum is zero. But when I compute it directly, I get (-2 cos(2π/5) -1) + (-2i sin(π/5)), which is not zero. This inconsistency suggests an error in my manual calculation.

Let me check the conversion of the angles again. For the exponential terms:

1. e^{-i4π/5}: angle is -4π/5, which is equivalent to 6π/5. cos(6π/5) = cos(π + π/5) = -cos(π/5), sin(6π/5) = sin(π + π/5) = -sin(π/5). So e^{-i4π/5} = -cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5). Correct.

2. e^{-i3π/5}: angle is -3π/5, equivalent to 7π/5. cos(7π/5) = cos(π + 2π/5) = -cos(2π/5), sin(7π/5) = sin(π + 2π/5) = -sin(2π/5). So e^{-i3π/5} = -cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5). Correct.

3. e^{-iπ} = -1. Correct.

4. e^{-i7π/5}: angle is -7π/5, equivalent to 3π/5. cos(3π/5) = -cos(2π/5), sin(3π/5) = sin(2π/5). So e^{-i7π/5} = -cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5). Wait, hold on, e^{-i7π/5} is the same as e^{i(-7π/5)}. But 7π/5 is 2π - 3π/5, so -7π/5 is equivalent to -7π/5 + 2π = 3π/5. So e^{-i7π/5} = e^{i3π/5} = cos(3π/5) + i sin(3π/5) = -cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5). Correct.

5. e^{-i9π/5}: angle is -9π/5, equivalent to π/5. cos(π/5) + i sin(π/5), but with negative angle: e^{-i9π/5} = e^{i(π/5)} = cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5). Wait, no. Wait, -9π/5 is equivalent to -9π/5 + 2π = π/5. So e^{-i9π/5} = e^{iπ/5} = cos(π/5) + i sin(π/5). But wait, no. Wait, -9π/5 is the same as -9π/5 + 2π = π/5. So e^{-i9π/5} = e^{iπ/5} = cos(π/5) + i sin(π/5). But that's not correct. Wait, no, e^{-iθ} = cosθ - i sinθ. So e^{-i9π/5} = cos(9π/5) - i sin(9π/5). But 9π/5 is equivalent to 9π/5 - 2π = -π/5. So cos(-π/5) = cos(π/5), sin(-π/5) = -sin(π/5). Therefore, e^{-i9π/5} = cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5). Correct.

So Term5 is cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5).

Now, adding Term1 and Term5:

Term1: -cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

Term5: cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

Sum: (-cos(π/5) + cos(π/5)) + (-i sin(π/5) - i sin(π/5)) = 0 - 2i sin(π/5)

Adding Term2 and Term4:

Term2: -cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5)

Term4: -cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5)

Sum: (-cos(2π/5) - cos(2π/5)) + (-i sin(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5)) = -2 cos(2π/5) + 0i

Adding Term3: -1

Total sum: (-2 cos(2π/5) -1) - 2i sin(π/5)

But according to Vieta's formula, this sum should be zero. Therefore, there must be an error in my calculation. Let me compute the numerical values:

Compute cos(2π/5) ≈ cos(72°) ≈ 0.3090

cos(π/5) ≈ cos(36°) ≈ 0.8090

sin(π/5) ≈ sin(36°) ≈ 0.5878

sin(2π/5) ≈ sin(72°) ≈ 0.9511

Compute the sum:

-2 * 0.3090 -1 = -0.618 -1 = -1.618

-2i * 0.5878 ≈ -1.1756i

So total sum ≈ -1.618 -1.1756i, which is not zero. This contradicts the residue theorem result. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my residue calculation.

Wait, perhaps the residues are not -α/5. Let's double-check the residue formula. The residue at a simple pole z=α of f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1) is lim_{z→α} (z - α)/(z^5 +1). The denominator can be factored as (z - α)(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4). Therefore, lim_{z→α} 1/(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4). Plugging z=α, we get 1/(α^4 + α^4 + α^4 + α^4 + α^4) = 1/(5α^4). So the residue is indeed 1/(5α^4). But since α^5 = -1, α^4 = -1/α. Therefore, 1/(5α^4) = -α/5. So the residue is -α/5. Therefore, the sum should be -1/5 Sum α_k. But Sum α_k =0, so the sum is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. But why does the direct calculation give a non-zero result? There must be a mistake in the direct calculation.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in identifying the residues. Let me check with a specific pole. Take α = e^{iπ/5}. Compute the residue:

Res_{α} = 1/(5α^4). Since α^5 = -1, α^4 = -1/α. Therefore, Res_{α} = 1/(5*(-1/α)) = -α/5. So that's correct. Similarly for other poles. Then the sum is -1/5 Sum α_k =0. Therefore, the integral is zero. The discrepancy arises because when I computed the sum manually, I probably messed up the exponentials. Let me try another approach. Let's compute the sum numerically.

Compute each residue numerically:

Compute α0 = e^{iπ/5} ≈ cos(36°) + i sin(36°) ≈ 0.8090 + i0.5878

Residue at α0: -α0/5 ≈ -(0.8090 + i0.5878)/5 ≈ -0.1618 -i0.1176

α1 = e^{i3π/5} ≈ cos(108°) + i sin(108°) ≈ -0.3090 + i0.9511

Residue at α1: -α1/5 ≈ 0.0618 -i0.1902

α2 = e^{iπ} = -1

Residue at α2: -(-1)/5 = 0.2

α3 = e^{i7π/5} ≈ cos(252°) + i sin(252°) ≈ -0.3090 -i0.9511

Residue at α3: -α3/5 ≈ 0.0618 +i0.1902

α4 = e^{i9π/5} ≈ cos(324°) + i sin(324°) ≈ 0.8090 -i0.5878

Residue at α4: -α4/5 ≈ -0.1618 +i0.1176

Now, sum all residues:

-0.1618 -i0.1176 + 0.0618 -i0.1902 + 0.2 + 0.0618 +i0.1902 -0.1618 +i0.1176

Compute real parts:

-0.1618 + 0.0618 + 0.2 + 0.0618 -0.1618 = (-0.1618 +0.0618) + (0.2 +0.0618 -0.1618) = (-0.1) + (0.1) = 0

Imaginary parts:

-0.1176 -0.1902 +0.1902 +0.1176 = (-0.1176 +0.1176) + (-0.1902 +0.1902) = 0 +0 =0

Wow, so the sum is indeed zero! I must have made an arithmetic mistake in my previous manual calculation. Therefore, the sum of residues is zero, and the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

But why did the direct substitution method also give zero? Because when I used the substitution w=1/z, the integral became the integral around |w|=1/2 of a function with no poles inside that contour, so the residue at w=0 was zero, leading to the original integral being zero. This confirms the result.

Therefore, after careful consideration and multiple methods, the integral evaluates to zero.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{1}{z^5+1} \\, dz \\) where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, we use the residue theorem. The poles of the function \\( \\frac{1}{z^5 + 1} \\) occur at the roots of \\( z^5 = -1 \\). These roots are the fifth roots of -1, given by \\( z = e^{i\\pi(1 + 2k)/5} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). All these roots lie on the unit circle, so they are inside the contour \\( |z| = 2 \\).

The residue at each simple pole \\( \\alpha \\) (where \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\)) is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{5\\alpha^4} \\). Using the fact that \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\), we find \\( \\alpha^4 = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\). Therefore, the residue at each pole simplifies to \\( -\\frac{\\alpha}{5} \\).

Summing the residues at all five poles, we get:
\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^4 -\\frac{\\alpha_k}{5} = -\\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\alpha_k
\\]
The sum of the roots of the polynomial \\( z^5 + 1 \\) is zero (by Vieta's formulas), so the sum of the residues is zero. Applying the residue theorem, the integral is:
\\[
2\\pi i \\times 0 = 0

Thus, the value of the integral is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around the circle |z| = 2. Hmm, let me think. First, I remember that for integrals around closed contours, especially when dealing with rational functions, the residue theorem is usually the way to go. The residue theorem says that the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function inside the contour. 

But wait, the function here is 1/(z^5 + 1). The denominator is z^5 + 1, so the poles are the solutions to z^5 + 1 = 0. Let me solve for z. If z^5 = -1, then the solutions are the fifth roots of -1. The roots of -1 are the same as the roots of unity multiplied by -1^(1/5). Since the fifth roots of unity are e^(2πik/5) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, then the fifth roots of -1 should be e^(πi(1 + 2k)/5) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Let me check that. If I raise those to the fifth power, I get e^(πi(1 + 2k)) = e^(iπ + 2πik) = -1, right? Yeah, that works. So the poles are at these points.

Now, since the contour is |z| = 2, which is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, all these poles are inside the contour because |z| = 2 is larger than the modulus of each root. Wait, the modulus of each root is 1 because they are on the unit circle. So all five poles are inside the contour. Therefore, I can apply the residue theorem by summing the residues at each of these poles.

But calculating the residues at each of the five poles might be tedious. Is there a smarter way to do this? Let me recall that for simple poles, the residue can be calculated using the formula Res(f, α) = lim_{z→α} (z - α)f(z). Since each pole is simple here (because the denominator has simple zeros), this should work. So for each root α, Res(1/(z^5 +1), α) = 1/(5α^4). Wait, let me verify that.

If f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1), then the derivative of the denominator at a root α is 5α^4. Therefore, the residue is indeed 1/(5α^4). So for each pole α_k, the residue is 1/(5α_k^4). Therefore, the sum of residues would be (1/5) times the sum of 1/α_k^4 over all k.

But maybe I can relate this sum to some other expression. Let me consider the polynomial z^5 + 1. The roots are α_0, α_1, α_2, α_3, α_4. Then, the sum of 1/α_k^4 can be related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Let me recall that if we have a polynomial P(z) with roots α_1, ..., α_n, then the sum of 1/α_i^m can be found using Newton's identities or by considering the reciprocal polynomial.

Alternatively, note that if α is a root of z^5 + 1 = 0, then α^5 = -1. Therefore, α^5 = -1 implies that α^4 = -1/α. So 1/α^4 = -α. Therefore, the sum of 1/α_k^4 is equal to -sum α_k. So the sum of residues is (1/5)(-sum α_k). Now, the sum of the roots of z^5 + 1 is zero because the coefficient of z^4 in the polynomial is zero. Wait, the polynomial is z^5 + 1, so the sum of the roots is -coefficient of z^4 divided by coefficient of z^5, which is 0/1 = 0. Therefore, sum α_k = 0. Therefore, the sum of residues is (1/5)(-0) = 0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0. So the integral is zero?

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. The key step was recognizing that 1/α^4 = -α. Let me verify that. If α^5 = -1, then α^5 + 1 = 0, so α^5 = -1. Multiply both sides by α^(-1): α^4 = -1/α. Therefore, 1/α^4 = -α. Yes, that's correct. Therefore, sum of 1/α^4 is sum of (-α) which is -sum α. And since sum α is zero, the total sum is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the residue calculation. The residue at a simple pole α is lim_{z→α} (z - α)/(z^5 + 1). Let me write z^5 + 1 = (z - α)(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4). Therefore, the residue is 1/(5α^4), right? Because the derivative of the denominator at α is 5α^4. So that's correct. Therefore, each residue is 1/(5α^4). Then, sum residues = (1/5) sum 1/α^4. Then, since 1/α^4 = -α, sum becomes (1/5) sum (-α) = -(1/5) sum α. And sum α is zero, so integral is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the residue theorem in a different way. Let me think. The function f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1) has poles inside |z|=2. The integral around the circle |z|=2 is the sum of residues inside the contour. But if the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero. Alternatively, perhaps using symmetry or another method.

Alternatively, note that the integral over a large circle can sometimes be evaluated by considering the behavior of the function at infinity. But in this case, since the contour is |z|=2, which is not a large circle, but just a circle enclosing all poles. However, if the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero, regardless of the contour. 

Wait, but is there another way to see that the integral is zero? For example, using Cauchy's theorem. If the function is analytic inside and on the contour, then the integral is zero. But the function 1/(z^5 +1) is not analytic inside the contour because it has poles there. So Cauchy's theorem doesn't apply directly. However, the function is meromorphic inside the contour, so we have to use the residue theorem. 

Alternatively, maybe integrating around a different contour. For instance, if the integral around a large circle can be shown to be zero, but that's not the case here. Alternatively, use substitution. Let me try substitution. Let z = 2e^{iθ}, but that might complicate things. No, perhaps not. 

Wait, but another thought: the integral of a rational function over a circle can sometimes be evaluated by expanding the function into a Laurent series and integrating term by term. But in this case, since the denominator is z^5 +1, expanding 1/(z^5 +1) as a power series might not be straightforward. Alternatively, partial fractions. But partial fractions for z^5 +1 might be complex. 

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of all residues (including the residue at infinity) is zero. Wait, the sum of residues of a meromorphic function in the extended complex plane is zero. But in this case, the function is 1/(z^5 +1). The residue at infinity is -Res(1/f, 0) where f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1). Wait, maybe that's a way to check. 

The residue at infinity is given by -Res(1/f, 0), where f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1). Wait, maybe I need to be careful here. The residue at infinity is equal to -Res(1/f, 0). Let me recall that for a function f(z), the residue at infinity is defined as the residue at 0 of -1/z^2 f(1/z). So, let's compute that. 

Let f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1). Then, 1/f(z) = z^5 +1. Therefore, -1/z^2 f(1/z) = -1/z^2 * (1/z^5 +1) = - (1/z^7 + 1/z^2). The residue at 0 of this is the coefficient of 1/z in the Laurent series. But -1/z^7 has no 1/z term, and -1/z^2 also has no 1/z term. Therefore, the residue at infinity is 0. Therefore, the sum of residues inside the contour plus the residue at infinity is zero. Therefore, sum of residues inside the contour is equal to the negative of the residue at infinity, which is zero. Therefore, the sum of residues inside the contour is zero, so the integral is zero. 

Therefore, this confirms the previous result. So regardless of the method, the integral is zero. 

But let me just check once more. Suppose I calculated the residues individually. Let's take one of the poles, say α = e^{iπ/5}. Then, the residue there is 1/(5α^4). Compute α^4: e^{i4π/5}. So 1/α^4 = e^{-i4π/5} = e^{i(6π/5)} = e^{i(π + π/5)} = -e^{iπ/5} = -α. Therefore, residue at α is -α/5. Similarly, for each pole, the residue is -α/5. Therefore, sum of residues is (-1/5)(α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 + α5). But the sum of the roots is zero, so sum of residues is zero. Therefore, integral is zero. 

Alternatively, if I didn't notice the sum of the roots is zero, I could compute the sum of residues by summing -α/5 for each root. But since the sum of the roots is zero, this gives zero. 

Therefore, all approaches lead to the conclusion that the integral is zero. 

But just to be thorough, let me compute the residues explicitly for two poles and see if the pattern holds. Let's take α1 = e^{iπ/5} and α2 = e^{i3π/5}. 

Compute residue at α1: 1/(5α1^4). α1^4 = e^{i4π/5}, so 1/α1^4 = e^{-i4π/5} = e^{i(6π/5)} = -e^{iπ/5} = -α1. Therefore, residue is -α1/5. Similarly, residue at α2: 1/(5α2^4). α2^4 = e^{i12π/5} = e^{i(2π + 2π/5)} = e^{i2π/5} = α3. Wait, no, wait. Wait, α2 is e^{i3π/5}, so α2^4 = e^{i12π/5} = e^{i(2π + 2π/5)} = e^{i2π/5} = α3? Wait, maybe not. Let me check. 

Wait, the roots are α_k = e^{iπ(1 + 2k)/5} for k=0,1,2,3,4. Let me list them:

k=0: e^{iπ/5}

k=1: e^{i3π/5}

k=2: e^{i5π/5} = e^{iπ} = -1

k=3: e^{i7π/5}

k=4: e^{i9π/5}

So, for k=0: α0 = e^{iπ/5}

k=1: α1 = e^{i3π/5}

k=2: α2 = e^{iπ} = -1

k=3: α3 = e^{i7π/5}

k=4: α4 = e^{i9π/5}

So, computing the residue at α0: -α0/5

Residue at α1: -α1/5

Residue at α2: -α2/5 = -(-1)/5 = 1/5

Residue at α3: -α3/5

Residue at α4: -α4/5

So summing these up:

Sum = (-α0 - α1 - (-1) - α3 - α4)/5

But α0 + α1 + α2 + α3 + α4 = 0, so:

Sum = (- (α0 + α1 + α3 + α4) - α2)/5 = (- (-α2) - α2)/5 = (α2 - α2)/5 = 0/5 = 0

Therefore, the sum is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

Therefore, regardless of the approach, the integral evaluates to zero. 

Final answer: 0, which in boxed form is \\boxed{0}

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Hmm, complex integrals can be tricky, but let's see. I remember that for such integrals, the residue theorem is usually the way to go. The residue theorem says that the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function inside the contour. So first, I need to find all the poles of the function inside the contour |z| = 2.

The function in question is 1/(z^5 + 1). The denominator is z^5 + 1, so the poles are the solutions to z^5 = -1. Let's solve that equation. The solutions to z^n = -1 are the nth roots of -1. Since -1 is e^(iπ), the nth roots would be e^(iπ(1 + 2k)/n) for k = 0, 1, ..., n-1. So for n=5, the roots are e^(iπ(1 + 2k)/5) for k = 0 to 4. Let me compute those:

For k=0: e^(iπ/5)
k=1: e^(i3π/5)
k=2: e^(i5π/5) = e^(iπ) = -1
k=3: e^(i7π/5)
k=4: e^(i9π/5)

Wait, but hold on, those are all on the unit circle. Since the modulus of each root is 1, they all lie on the circle of radius 1. The contour here is a circle of radius 2, so all these poles are inside the contour. Therefore, the integral should be 2πi times the sum of the residues at each of these five poles.

So I need to compute the residue at each of these poles. Since all poles are simple (because the denominator has simple roots), the residue at each pole z = α is 1/(5α^4). Let me confirm that. If f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1), then near a root α of z^5 + 1, we can write f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1) = 1/((z - α)(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4)). So the residue at α is 1/(5α^4). Wait, because the derivative of the denominator at α is 5α^4, so by the formula for residues at simple poles, residue = numerator / derivative of denominator = 1/(5α^4).

Therefore, each residue is 1/(5α^4). So the total integral is 2πi times the sum over k=0 to 4 of 1/(5α_k^4), where α_k are the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0.

But maybe there's a smarter way to compute the sum of these residues without having to compute each one individually. Let's see. Let's denote the roots as α_0, α_1, α_2, α_3, α_4. Then the sum of residues is (1/5) * sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4.

But since the roots satisfy z^5 + 1 = 0, we have z^5 = -1. So for each root α_k, α_k^5 = -1. Therefore, α_k^(-1) = -α_k^4. Let's check: If α^5 = -1, then α^4 = (-1)/α, so 1/α^4 = -α. Therefore, 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4 = - sum_{k=0}^4 α_k.

So the sum of residues is (1/5)*(- sum_{k=0}^4 α_k). So now, I need to compute the sum of the roots of the equation z^5 + 1 = 0. But wait, the equation is z^5 + 1 = 0, which can be written as z^5 = -1. The sum of the roots of a polynomial is equal to -coefficient of z^4 divided by coefficient of z^5. But in the polynomial z^5 + 1, the coefficient of z^4 is 0, so the sum of the roots is 0. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = 0. Therefore, the sum of the residues is (1/5)*(-0) = 0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. The roots of z^5 + 1 = 0 are the fifth roots of -1, which are spaced evenly around the unit circle. The sum of all roots of a polynomial is given by -coefficient of z^{n-1} over coefficient of z^n. In this case, the polynomial is z^5 + 1, so the coefficient of z^4 is 0, so sum of roots is 0. Therefore, the sum of residues is indeed 0, so the integral is zero.

But let me check another way. Alternatively, maybe using symmetry. Since the roots are symmetrically placed around the unit circle, their sum should be zero. For example, in the case of roots of unity, the sum is zero. Here, the roots are the fifth roots of -1, which are also symmetrically placed, so their sum should be zero. Therefore, the sum of residues is zero, leading to the integral being zero.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around a large circle can be related to the residues, but here the circle is of radius 2, which is larger than the unit circle, so all poles are inside. However, integrating over a large circle, but the answer is zero. Alternatively, maybe think about the function 1/(z^5 + 1) and check if it has any pole at infinity, but I think the residues at infinity can be considered, but since the function is a rational function with degree 5 in the denominator and 0 in the numerator, the residue at infinity is zero. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, think about the function 1/(z^5 + 1) and integrate over |z|=2. If all the residues sum to zero, then the integral is zero. But is there another way to see that?

Alternatively, consider that the integral can be computed using the residue theorem, but if the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero. Let me check with a different contour. If I take a contour that encloses all the poles, like a circle of radius large enough, then the integral would be 2πi times the sum of residues inside. But if I take a contour of radius 2, which is larger than the unit circle, then the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues inside, which are all five poles. But according to the residue sum, that sum is zero, so the integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the function is meromorphic, and the integral over a closed contour is determined by the residues inside. Since all residues sum to zero, the integral is zero.

But wait, is there a mistake here? Let me check again the residue calculation. The residue at each pole α is 1/(5α^4). Then sum_{k=0}^4 1/(5α_k^4). Then, since α_k^5 = -1, α_k^4 = (-1)/α_k, so 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 1/(5α_k^4) = sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k)/5 = (-1/5) * sum_{k=0}^4 α_k. But sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = 0, as the sum of roots of z^5 + 1 = 0 is zero. Therefore, the sum of residues is zero, so integral is zero. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the function is odd or something? Wait, 1/(z^5 + 1) is not an odd function. For example, replacing z with -z gives 1/(-z^5 + 1), which is different. So symmetry might not help here.

Alternatively, consider that the integral over a large circle can be related to the residue at infinity. But since the function is 1/(z^5 + 1), as z approaches infinity, it behaves like 1/z^5, so the residue at infinity is zero. Therefore, the integral over a large circle is zero. But since the integral over |z|=2 is equal to the sum of residues inside, which is zero, so the integral is zero. Therefore, both methods agree.

Therefore, the answer should be zero. But why does the user mention \\frac{2}{3} in the problem statement? Wait, maybe there's a typo. Wait, the problem says ""Evaluate the integral... where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. \\frac{2}{3}"". Maybe that's a typo, maybe it's supposed to be part of the problem, but maybe the user intended to write the answer as 2/3? But according to my calculations, it's zero. Let me check again.

Wait, did I make a mistake in the residue calculation? Let me verify. If f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1), then the poles are at the roots of z^5 = -1. The residue at a simple pole z = α is given by lim_{z→α} (z - α)f(z). So f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1) = 1/((z - α)(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4)). So the residue is 1/(5α^4) as calculated before. Then, since α^5 = -1, so α^4 = (-1)/α. Therefore, 1/α^4 = -α. Therefore, sum of residues is (1/5) * sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k) = (-1/5)*sum α_k = 0. Therefore, integral is 2πi * 0 = 0. So that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe the original problem was different, but as stated, it's 1/(z^5 + 1). Let me check with a small example. Suppose the integral was over |z|=1, but since all poles are on the unit circle, the integral would not include them, so the integral would be zero. But for |z|=2, it includes all poles, but their residues sum to zero. Therefore, the integral is zero.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is zero. The user might have included \\frac{2}{3} by mistake, but according to the calculations, it's zero. Maybe the problem was different, like integrating over a different function or a different path. But as stated, with the given function and contour, the integral is zero.

","Alright, let's try to figure out how to evaluate this integral: the contour integral around the circle |z| = 2 of 1/(z^5 + 1) dz. Hmm, okay. So, first, I remember that when you have a contour integral like this, especially around a closed path, the residue theorem might be really useful. The residue theorem says that the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function at the poles inside the contour. 

So, the first step is to find all the poles of the function 1/(z^5 + 1). The poles occur where the denominator is zero, right? So, solving z^5 + 1 = 0. That equation is z^5 = -1. To find the roots of this equation, I can express -1 in polar form. Since -1 is the same as e^{iπ}, but also, since e^{iθ} is periodic with period 2π, -1 is also e^{i(π + 2πk)} where k is any integer. So, the fifth roots of -1 would be given by e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Let me check that. If we take the fifth roots, we divide the angle by 5, so each root will be at angles π/5, 3π/5, 5π/5=π, 7π/5, and 9π/5. Wait, but 5π/5 is π, which is the same as the original point -1. So, those are the five roots: e^{iπ/5}, e^{i3π/5}, e^{iπ}, e^{i7π/5}, and e^{i9π/5}. 

Now, the contour is |z| = 2, which is a circle with radius 2 centered at the origin. All the roots we found are on the unit circle because they have magnitude 1. The radius of the contour is 2, which is larger than 1, so all these poles are inside the contour. Therefore, the integral should be 2πi times the sum of the residues at each of these five poles. 

So, the next step is to compute the residues at each of these poles. Since all these poles are simple poles (because the denominator is z^5 + 1, and the derivative of the denominator at z = α is 5α^4, which is not zero since α ≠ 0), we can use the formula for the residue at a simple pole: Res(f, α) = lim_{z→α} (z - α)f(z) = 1/(5α^4). 

But wait, let me verify that. The function is f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1), and the poles are at z = α where α^5 = -1. So, the residue at each pole α is 1/(5α^4). Let me check that again. If we have a function g(z) = (z - α)h(z), and h(z) is analytic at α, then the residue of g/h at α is h(α). But in this case, f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1). Let me write it as f(z) = 1/( (z - α)(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4 ) ). Wait, maybe that's complicating it. Alternatively, using the formula for residues at simple poles: if f(z) = 1/P(z), and P(z) has a simple root at α, then the residue is 1/P'(α). Since P(z) = z^5 + 1, P'(z) = 5z^4, so the residue is 1/(5α^4). Yeah, that's right. So, each residue is 1/(5α^4). 

But since α^5 = -1, maybe we can express α^4 in terms of α. Let's see, since α^5 = -1, then α^5 + 1 = 0, so α^4 = -1/α. Therefore, 1/(5α^4) = -α/(5). That simplifies things a bit. So, each residue is -α/(5). Therefore, the sum of all residues would be -1/5 times the sum of all α's. 

Now, the sum of all the poles α is the sum of the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0. The polynomial z^5 + 1 can be factored as (z + 1)(z^4 - z^3 + z^2 - z + 1). Wait, but actually, the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0 are the 5th roots of -1, which are given by e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k = 0,1,2,3,4. The sum of the roots of a polynomial z^5 + az^4 + bz^3 + cz^2 + dz + e is equal to -a. In this case, the polynomial is z^5 + 0z^4 + 0z^3 + 0z^2 + 0z + 1, so the sum of the roots is -0/1 = 0. Therefore, the sum of all residues is -1/5 times 0 = 0. Wait, that would mean the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0? But that seems too simple. Is that correct?

Wait, let me check again. The sum of the residues is the sum of -α/(5) for each α, which is -1/5 times the sum of the roots. The sum of the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0 is indeed zero, because the coefficient of z^4 is zero. Therefore, the sum of residues is zero, so the integral is zero. But that seems surprising. Is there a mistake here?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the residue calculation. Let me verify. If f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1), then the residue at a pole α (where α^5 = -1) is 1/(5α^4). Since α^5 = -1, then α^4 = -1/(α). So, 1/(5α^4) = -α/5. Therefore, each residue is -α/5, so sum of residues is -1/5 (sum of α). Since the sum of α is zero, the integral is zero. 

But wait, let me check with another approach. Maybe using the residue theorem in a different way. Alternatively, since the function is 1/(z^5 + 1), and the contour is a circle of radius 2, which is larger than the unit circle where all the poles lie. So, according to the residue theorem, the integral should be equal to 2πi times the sum of residues inside the contour. But according to my calculation, that sum is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

But maybe I should check with another method. For example, if I consider the integral over a large circle, since the function is rational with degree of denominator higher than numerator, then the integral should go to zero as the radius increases. But our contour is fixed at radius 2. Wait, but even so, in this case, all poles are inside the contour. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that the sum of the residues is zero. Let me compute the sum of residues manually. Let's take each root α_k = e^{iπ(2k+1)/5} for k = 0 to 4. Then, sum_{k=0}^4 Res(f, α_k) = sum_{k=0}^4 [ -α_k / 5 ] = -1/5 sum_{k=0}^4 α_k. But as we saw, the sum of the roots is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the integral and compute it directly, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, consider that the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around a large circle. But since the integral should be zero in that case. Wait, but here the contour is fixed at radius 2. Hmm. 

Wait, another approach: the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) over the circle |z|=R, as R tends to infinity, should be zero because the numerator is degree 0 and denominator is degree 5, so the function decays like 1/R^5, and the integral over a circle is 2πR * 1/R^5 = 2π/R^4, which tends to zero as R → ∞. Therefore, in the limit, the integral is zero. But our contour is at R=2, so maybe the integral is not zero. But according to the residue theorem, it should be equal to 2πi times the sum of residues, which is zero. So, contradiction? 

Wait, but perhaps my previous conclusion is correct. Let me check with another example. Suppose we have the integral of 1/(z^2 + 1) over a circle of radius 2. The poles are at i and -i, both inside the circle. The residues are each 1/(2i) and 1/(-2i), so sum is 0, so the integral is zero. But actually, the integral of 1/(z^2 + 1) over a large circle does go to zero, but in that case, the integral is zero. So, in our case, maybe the same applies. 

Wait, but let me compute the integral numerically for a simple case. Suppose R is very large, then the integral is approximately the integral of 1/z^5 over the circle, which is 0 because the integral of 1/z^n around a circle is zero for n ≠ 1. So, that makes sense. Therefore, in our case, the integral should be zero. 

But wait, but if all the residues sum to zero, then the integral is zero. But is that possible? Let me think. Suppose we have a function with multiple poles inside the contour, and the sum of residues is zero. Then the integral is zero. For example, the function 1/(z^2 + 1) has poles at i and -i, residues sum to zero, so the integral is zero. Similarly, here, the sum of residues is zero, so the integral is zero. 

Therefore, perhaps the answer is zero. But the original problem says ""Evaluate the integral... where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. 2/3"". Wait, maybe there's a typo here. The user wrote ""Return your fina Evaluate the integral... where the contour is a circle... 2/3"". Maybe the 2/3 is part of the problem statement? Wait, the original problem is written as:

""Evaluate the integral \\( \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{1}{z^5+1} \\, dz \\) where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\)""

Wait, maybe the user intended to include \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) as part of the problem, but it's unclear. Maybe it's a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the answer is \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\), but according to my calculation, it's zero. 

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the residues. Let me check again. Let's take one pole, say α = e^{iπ/5}. Then, the residue at α is 1/(5α^4). Since α^5 = -1, α^4 = α^(-1) * α^5 = -1 * α^(-1) = -α^(-1). Therefore, α^4 = -1/α. Therefore, 1/(5α^4) = -α/5. Similarly, for all other poles, the residue is -α/5. Therefore, sum of residues is -1/5 * sum(α). But sum(α) is zero, so the integral is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe the user made a typo and the intended integral was different. For example, if it was 1/(z^5 - 1), the sum of residues would not be zero. But given the problem as stated, it's 1/(z^5 +1). 

Alternatively, maybe the contour is not enclosing all poles. Wait, no, the contour is |z|=2, which is radius 2, so all poles with |α|=1 are inside. Therefore, the integral should be zero. 

But perhaps the user is expecting a different answer. Let me think if there's another approach. For example, expanding the function into partial fractions or series. But that seems complicated. Alternatively, consider that the integral is equal to the coefficient of z^4 in the Laurent expansion of the function around infinity, multiplied by 2πi. But that might be more involved. 

Alternatively, consider that the integral over a large circle is zero, so if the integral over |z|=2 is equal to the integral over a large circle, which is zero, but that's not necessarily the case. Wait, no, the integral over a large circle would be zero because the function decays like 1/R^5, so the integral is zero. But the integral over |z|=2 is not necessarily the same as the integral over a large circle, unless the difference is a closed contour. Wait, but if I consider a large circle with radius R and the circle |z|=2, then the region between them is an annulus, but the function is analytic in that region except at the poles inside |z|=2. So, by Cauchy's theorem, the integral over the large circle minus the integral over |z|=2 is zero, because there are no poles in the annulus. Therefore, the integral over |z|=2 is equal to the integral over the large circle, which is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

Therefore, both methods suggest that the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero. But the user included \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) at the end, maybe expecting that answer. But according to the calculations, it's zero. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I missed something. 

Wait, let me check the residue calculation again. If the function is f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1), then the residue at a pole α is 1/(5α^4). Since α^5 = -1, then α^4 = -1/α. Therefore, 1/(5α^4) = -α/5. Therefore, each residue is -α/5. So, sum of residues is -1/5 sum(α). Since sum(α) = 0, the integral is zero. 

Therefore, unless there is a miscalculation here, the answer should be zero. Alternatively, maybe the integral is not over the circle |z|=2 but over another contour. Wait, the problem says ""the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin"". So, that's correct. 

Alternatively, maybe the user intended to write a different function. For example, if it's 1/(z^3 +1), then the integral would be non-zero. But given the problem as stated, it's 1/(z^5 +1). 

Alternatively, maybe the user is testing if I know that the integral is zero. But according to the residue theorem, it is zero. Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation, the answer is zero. 

But wait, let me check with specific example. Suppose we take the integral of 1/(z^2 +1) over |z|=2, which has poles at i and -i. The residues are 1/(2i) and 1/(-2i), which sum to zero, so the integral is zero. Similarly, here, the sum of residues is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. 

Therefore, after going through multiple checks and approaches, I think the integral evaluates to zero. Therefore, the answer is 0. But the user included \\(\\frac{2}{3}\\) at the end, which might be a distractor or a mistake. Therefore, the correct answer should be 0.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{1}{z^5+1} \\, dz \\) where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, we use the residue theorem. The poles of the function \\( \\frac{1}{z^5 + 1} \\) occur at the roots of \\( z^5 = -1 \\). These roots are the fifth roots of -1, given by \\( z = e^{i\\pi(1 + 2k)/5} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). All these roots lie on the unit circle, so they are inside the contour \\( |z| = 2 \\).

The residue at each simple pole \\( \\alpha \\) (where \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\)) is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{5\\alpha^4} \\). Using the fact that \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\), we find \\( \\alpha^4 = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\). Therefore, the residue at each pole simplifies to \\( -\\frac{\\alpha}{5} \\).

Summing the residues at all five poles, we get:
\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^4 -\\frac{\\alpha_k}{5} = -\\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\alpha_k
\\]
The sum of the roots of the polynomial \\( z^5 + 1 \\) is zero (by Vieta's formulas), so the sum of the residues is zero. Applying the residue theorem, the integral is:
\\[
2\\pi i \\times 0 = 0
\\]

Thus, the value of the integral is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Hmm, let's start by recalling some complex analysis. I remember that for integrals of rational functions around closed contours, the residue theorem is really useful. The residue theorem says that the integral is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function inside the contour. 

First, I need to find the poles of the function 1/(z^5 + 1). The poles occur where the denominator is zero, so solving z^5 + 1 = 0. Let me write that as z^5 = -1. The solutions to this equation are the fifth roots of -1. Since -1 is e^{iπ} on the complex plane, the fifth roots should be at e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That gives us five roots, each separated by 2π/5 radians. Let me compute those roots:

For k = 0: e^{iπ/5} = cos(π/5) + i sin(π/5)
k = 1: e^{i3π/5} = cos(3π/5) + i sin(3π/5)
k = 2: e^{i5π/5} = e^{iπ} = -1
k = 3: e^{i7π/5} = cos(7π/5) + i sin(7π/5)
k = 4: e^{i9π/5} = cos(9π/5) + i sin(9π/5)

Wait, so all these roots lie on the unit circle, right? Because the modulus of each root is 1. Since the contour here is a circle of radius 2, all these poles are inside the contour. So the integral should be 2πi times the sum of the residues at each of these five poles.

Now, to compute the residues. Since all the poles are simple (because the derivative of z^5 + 1 is 5z^4, which is not zero at any of the poles), the residue at each pole z_j can be calculated as 1/(5z_j^4). Let me verify that. The general formula for the residue at a simple pole z_j is lim_{z→z_j} (z - z_j) f(z). Here, f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1) = 1/(z - z_j)(z^4 + z_j z^3 + z_j^2 z^2 + z_j^3 z + z_j^4). So the residue is indeed 1/(5z_j^4) because the derivative of the denominator at z_j is 5z_j^4.

So, the residue at each pole z_j is 1/(5z_j^4). Therefore, the sum of the residues is (1/5) * sum_{j=1}^5 1/z_j^4. Now, I need to compute this sum. Let's denote the poles as z_0, z_1, z_2, z_3, z_4, where z_j = e^{i(π + 2πj)/5} for j = 0 to 4.

Alternatively, since z_j are the fifth roots of -1, they satisfy z_j^5 = -1. Let me see if I can relate z_j^4 to something. Since z_j^5 = -1, then z_j^4 = -1/z_j. So 1/z_j^4 = -z_j. Therefore, 1/z_j^4 = -z_j. Therefore, the sum of the residues is (1/5) * sum_{j=0}^4 (-z_j) = (-1/5) * sum_{j=0}^4 z_j.

Now, what is the sum of the roots z_j? The roots of z^5 + 1 = 0 are the fifth roots of -1, which is the same as the roots of z^5 = -1. The sum of the roots of a polynomial z^5 + a z^4 + ... + c = 0 is -a. But in our case, the polynomial is z^5 + 1 = 0, so the coefficient of z^4 is 0. Therefore, the sum of the roots is -0 = 0. Therefore, sum_{j=0}^4 z_j = 0. Therefore, the sum of the residues is (-1/5)*0 = 0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. The sum of the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0 is indeed zero because the coefficient of z^4 is zero. So sum z_j = 0. Then sum 1/z_j^4 = sum (-z_j) = -sum z_j = 0. Therefore, the integral is zero.

But wait, is that correct? Let me verify with another approach. Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize the integral and compute it directly, but that seems complicated. Alternatively, note that the function 1/(z^5 + 1) has poles at the fifth roots of -1, all inside the circle of radius 2, and the sum of residues is zero, hence the integral is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe I can use the residue theorem in a different way. For example, consider integrating around a large circle, but since our radius is 2, which is larger than the unit circle, but the function 1/(z^5 + 1) behaves like 1/z^5 for large z, so the integral over a large circle would go to zero as the radius goes to infinity. But since our radius is fixed at 2, which is large enough to enclose all poles, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the integral over a keyhole contour, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, note that the function 1/(z^5 + 1) is a rational function with denominator of higher degree than numerator, so by Cauchy's theorem, the integral around any closed contour is zero if there are no poles inside. But here, there are poles inside, so the residue theorem applies.

Wait, but according to the residue theorem, the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues. We found that the sum is zero, so the integral is zero. But let me verify this with a different method. Suppose I consider the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) over a keyhole contour that goes around the branch cuts. Wait, maybe not necessary here. Alternatively, note that the function is analytic except at the poles, so the integral is determined by the residues. But perhaps the sum of residues is zero.

Alternatively, maybe the sum of residues is not zero. Wait, let's compute the sum of 1/z_j^4 again. Since z_j^5 = -1, so z_j^4 = -1/z_j. Therefore, 1/z_j^4 = -z_j. Therefore, sum_{j=0}^4 1/z_j^4 = -sum_{j=0}^4 z_j = 0. Therefore, yes, the sum is zero.

Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0. So the answer is 0. But wait, the problem says to evaluate the integral and the answer is given as 2/3. Wait, no, the problem is just asking to evaluate the integral, and the user wrote ""where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin."" Then the initial problem statement is correct. Wait, but according to my calculation, the integral is zero. But maybe there is an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let's check again. Let me take a specific example. Let's take z = 1. Then z^5 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2. If I take z = e^{iπ/5}, then z^5 = e^{iπ} = -1, so that's correct. So all roots are on the unit circle. The sum of residues is sum_{j=0}^4 1/(5 z_j^4) = (1/5) sum_{j=0}^4 1/z_j^4. Then as before, 1/z_j^4 = -z_j, so sum is (1/5)(-sum z_j) = 0. Therefore, integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

But the problem says ""Evaluate the integral... where the contour is a circle of radius 2..."" and the user wrote ""frac{2}{3}"" at the end. Wait, maybe that's a typo. Wait, the original problem is written as:

""Return your fina Evaluate the integral \\( \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{1}{z^5+1} \\, dz \\) where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.\\frac{2}{3}$""

Wait, maybe the user is indicating that the answer is 2/3? But according to my calculation, it's zero. Hmm. Let me check again.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the residues. Let me recalculate the residue at each pole. The residue at a simple pole z_j is lim_{z→z_j} (z - z_j)/(z^5 + 1). Since z^5 + 1 = (z - z_j)(z^4 + z_j z^3 + z_j^2 z^2 + z_j^3 z + z_j^4). Therefore, the limit is 1/(5 z_j^4). Correct. Therefore, the residue is indeed 1/(5 z_j^4). Then, since z_j^5 = -1, z_j^4 = -1/z_j. Therefore, 1/z_j^4 = -z_j. Therefore, sum of residues is (1/5)(-sum z_j) = 0. Hence, the integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe the function has another pole at infinity? Wait, the integral over a large circle would be zero, but here we are integrating over a circle of radius 2. Alternatively, maybe the function has a pole at infinity, but the residue at infinity is the negative of the sum of residues at finite poles. But since our contour does not include infinity, maybe that's not relevant here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute the integral using a different approach. Let's parametrize the integral. Let z = 2e^{iθ}, θ from 0 to 2π. Then dz = 2i e^{iθ} dθ. Then the integral becomes ∫0^{2π} [1/( (2e^{iθ})^5 + 1 )] * 2i e^{iθ} dθ. Simplify the denominator: (2e^{iθ})^5 = 32 e^{i5θ}, so denominator is 32 e^{i5θ} + 1. Therefore, the integral becomes 2i ∫0^{2π} e^{iθ}/(32 e^{i5θ} + 1) dθ. Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe expanding this as a series would help, but I don't know.

Alternatively, perhaps using the residue theorem is the correct approach, and my initial conclusion that the integral is zero is correct. But why does the user mention frac{2}{3} at the end? Maybe that's a red herring, or perhaps I misread the problem. Wait, the problem is written as:

""Return your fina Evaluate the integral \\( \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{1}{z^5+1} \\, dz \\) where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.\\frac{2}{3}$""

Wait, maybe the user intended to say that the answer is 2/3, but that's conflicting with my calculation. Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, let me check again. Suppose I have the integral over the unit circle. Then, using residue theorem, the same reasoning would apply? Wait, but the unit circle would only include the poles on the unit circle. Wait, but all poles lie on the unit circle. Wait, no, the poles are at e^{i(π + 2πk)/5}, which are on the unit circle, but the radius 2 circle includes all poles. Wait, but if the radius were 1, the integral would not include the poles at z = e^{iπ} (which is -1), but actually, all poles are on the unit circle, so for radius 2, all poles are inside. Therefore, the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues, which is zero. Therefore, the integral should be zero.

Wait, but maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check an example. Consider integrating 1/(z^2 + 1) around a circle of radius 2. The poles are at i and -i, both inside. The residues are each 1/(2i) and 1/(-2i), sum to 0. Therefore, the integral is zero. Similarly, here, sum of residues is zero, so integral is zero. So that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) over a large circle is zero, but here the radius is 2. Wait, but the integral over a large circle would be zero because the integrand behaves like 1/z^5, which is integrable over a circle. Wait, but the residue theorem says that the integral over a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of residues inside. If the contour is large enough to include all poles, then the sum of residues is zero, so the integral is zero. Therefore, that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in thinking that the sum of residues is zero. Let me compute the sum numerically. Take specific roots. Let's compute the residues. Take z_0 = e^{iπ/5}, z_1 = e^{i3π/5}, z_2 = e^{iπ}, z_3 = e^{i7π/5}, z_4 = e^{i9π/5}.

Compute 1/(5 z_j^4) for each j. Let's compute for z_0: z_0 = e^{iπ/5}, so z_0^4 = e^{i4π/5}, so 1/z_0^4 = e^{-i4π/5}. Similarly, for z_1: z_1 = e^{i3π/5}, z_1^4 = e^{i12π/5} = e^{i2π/5}, so 1/z_1^4 = e^{-i2π/5}. For z_2: z_2 = e^{iπ}, z_2^4 = e^{i4π} = 1, so 1/z_2^4 = 1. For z_3: z_3 = e^{i7π/5}, z_3^4 = e^{i28π/5} = e^{i8π/5}, so 1/z_3^4 = e^{-i8π/5}. For z_4: z_4 = e^{i9π/5}, z_4^4 = e^{i36π/5} = e^{i16π/5} = e^{i6π/5}, so 1/z_4^4 = e^{-i6π/5}.

So the residues are:

Residue at z_0: (1/5) e^{-i4π/5}

Residue at z_1: (1/5) e^{-i2π/5}

Residue at z_2: (1/5)(1) = 1/5

Residue at z_3: (1/5) e^{-i8π/5}

Residue at z_4: (1/5) e^{-i6π/5}

Now, let's sum these up. Let's write them as complex numbers:

Residues:

1. (1/5)(cos(-4π/5) + i sin(-4π/5)) = (1/5)(cos(4π/5) - i sin(4π/5))

2. (1/5)(cos(-2π/5) + i sin(-2π/5)) = (1/5)(cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5))

3. 1/5

4. (1/5)(cos(-8π/5) + i sin(-8π/5)) = (1/5)(cos(8π/5) - i sin(8π/5))

5. (1/5)(cos(-6π/5) + i sin(-6π/5)) = (1/5)(cos(6π/5) - i sin(6π/5))

Now, let's compute the sum of real parts and imaginary parts separately.

First, note that:

cos(4π/5) = cos(π - π/5) = -cos(π/5) ≈ -0.8090

cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090

cos(8π/5) = cos(2π - 2π/5) = cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090

cos(6π/5) = cos(π + π/5) = -cos(π/5) ≈ -0.8090

Similarly for the imaginary parts:

sin(-4π/5) = -sin(4π/5) = -sin(π - π/5) = -sin(π/5) ≈ -0.5878

sin(-2π/5) = -sin(2π/5) ≈ -0.9511

sin(-8π/5) = -sin(8π/5) = -sin(2π - 2π/5) = -(-sin(2π/5)) = sin(2π/5) ≈ 0.9511

sin(-6π/5) = -sin(6π/5) = -sin(π + π/5) = -(-sin(π/5)) = sin(π/5) ≈ 0.5878

So substituting these values:

Real parts:

1. (1/5)(-0.8090) ≈ -0.1618

2. (1/5)(0.3090) ≈ 0.0618

3. 1/5 = 0.2

4. (1/5)(0.3090) ≈ 0.0618

5. (1/5)(-0.8090) ≈ -0.1618

Sum of real parts:

-0.1618 + 0.0618 + 0.2 + 0.0618 -0.1618 ≈ (-0.1618 -0.1618) + (0.0618 + 0.0618 + 0.2) ≈ (-0.3236) + (0.3236) ≈ 0

Imaginary parts:

1. (1/5)(-0.5878) ≈ -0.1176

2. (1/5)(-0.9511) ≈ -0.1902

3. 0

4. (1/5)(0.9511) ≈ 0.1902

5. (1/5)(0.5878) ≈ 0.1176

Sum of imaginary parts:

-0.1176 -0.1902 + 0 + 0.1902 + 0.1176 ≈ (-0.1176 + 0.1176) + (-0.1902 + 0.1902) ≈ 0 + 0 ≈ 0

Therefore, the total sum of residues is approximately 0 + 0i = 0, which confirms our previous conclusion. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0.

But the problem statement ends with \\frac{2}{3}, which is confusing. Maybe the problem was different? Or perhaps the user made a mistake in providing the problem. Alternatively, perhaps there's a miscalculation here.

Wait, let me check once more. The function is 1/(z^5 + 1). The poles are at z = e^{i(π + 2πk)/5}, k=0,...,4. These are all on the unit circle. The sum of residues is (1/5) sum_{j=0}^4 1/z_j^4. But since z_j^5 = -1, 1/z_j^4 = -z_j. Therefore, sum_{j=0}^4 1/z_j^4 = -sum_{j=0}^4 z_j = 0. Therefore, the sum of residues is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

Therefore, the given fraction 2/3 must be incorrect. Perhaps the problem was miswritten. Alternatively, maybe the integral was supposed to be over a different function. For example, if the integral were of 1/(z^5 - 1), the sum of residues would not necessarily be zero. But in this case, it's 1/(z^5 + 1).

Alternatively, perhaps the contour is not the circle of radius 2, but the unit circle. But even then, the integral would be zero, because the sum of residues is zero. Wait, no, if the contour is the unit circle, then only the poles on the unit circle are included. But in our case, all poles are on the unit circle, so even for the unit circle, the integral would be zero. Wait, but if the contour is the unit circle, then the integral would be zero? But that contradicts some examples. For example, integrating 1/(z^2 + 1) around the unit circle: the poles at i and -i are outside the unit circle, so the integral would be zero. But if the poles were inside, like integrating 1/(z^2 - 1) around the unit circle, the integral would be the sum of residues at z=1 and z=-1, which are both on the unit circle, but since they are simple poles, the residues would be 1/(2z) at each pole, so sum is (1/2)(1 + (-1)) = 0. Therefore, integral is zero. Wait, but in reality, integrating 1/(z^2 - 1) around the unit circle would actually have singularities on the contour, which is not allowed. So in cases where poles lie on the contour, the integral isn't defined in the usual sense. But in our case, all poles are on the unit circle, but the contour is of radius 2, so they are inside. Therefore, the integral is zero.

Therefore, I think the answer is indeed zero. The user might have intended a different problem where the answer is 2/3, but as written, the integral is zero. Therefore, I should conclude that the integral is zero.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{1}{z^5+1} \\, dz \\) where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, we use the residue theorem. The poles of the function \\( \\frac{1}{z^5 + 1} \\) occur at the roots of \\( z^5 = -1 \\). These roots are the fifth roots of -1, given by \\( z = e^{i\\pi(1 + 2k)/5} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). All these roots lie on the unit circle, so they are inside the contour \\( |z| = 2 \\).

The residue at each simple pole \\( \\alpha \\) (where \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\)) is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{5\\alpha^4} \\). Using the fact that \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\), we find \\( \\alpha^4 = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\). Therefore, the residue at each pole simplifies to \\( -\\frac{\\alpha}{5} \\).

Summing the residues at all five poles, we get:
\\[

The sum of the roots of the polynomial \\( z^5 + 1 \\) is zero (by Vieta's formulas), so the sum of the residues is zero. Applying the residue theorem, the integral is:

Thus, the value of the integral is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around the circle |z| = 2. Hmm, let me think. I remember that for complex integrals, especially around closed contours, the residue theorem is really useful. The residue theorem says that if you have a function that's analytic inside and on a simple closed contour C, except for a finite number of singularities inside C, then the integral around C is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues at those singularities.

First, let me check the function f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1). The denominator is z^5 + 1, so the poles of this function are the roots of the equation z^5 + 1 = 0. Solving z^5 = -1, right? The solutions are the fifth roots of -1. Since -1 can be written in polar form as e^(iπ + 2πik) for integer k, the fifth roots would be e^(i(π + 2πk)/5) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So those are the poles: z = e^(iπ/5), e^(i3π/5), e^(i5π/5) = e^(iπ) = -1, e^(i7π/5), e^(i9π/5). Wait, e^(i5π/5) is e^(iπ), which is -1. So the poles are at those five points. Now, all these poles lie on the unit circle because |z| = 1 for each root of unity. But our contour is the circle with radius 2, which is larger. So all five poles are inside the contour |z| = 2. That means I need to calculate the sum of the residues at each of these five poles and multiply by 2πi to get the value of the integral.

Alright, so now the task is to compute the residues at each of these poles. Since all poles are simple (because the denominator is z^5 +1, which has simple roots), the residue at each pole z = α is given by lim_{z → α} (z - α) * f(z) = lim_{z → α} (z - α)/(z^5 + 1). But since z^5 +1 factors as (z - α)(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4), then the limit becomes 1/(5α^4 + 1). Wait, no, the derivative of the denominator at z = α is 5z^4, so by the formula for simple poles, the residue is 1/(5α^4). Because if f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1) and z = α is a simple pole, then Res(f, α) = 1/(d/dz (z^5 +1)|_{z=α}) ) = 1/(5α^4). So the residue at each pole α is 1/(5α^4).

Therefore, the total sum of residues is the sum over all five poles of 1/(5α^4). Let me write that as (1/5) * sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4, where α_k are the fifth roots of -1. Let me compute this sum. Let's denote S = sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4. Then the integral is 2πi * (1/5) * S = (2πi/5) * S. So I need to compute S.

But how do I compute S? The α_k are the roots of z^5 = -1. Let me recall that if you have a polynomial z^n + c = 0, the roots are related. Here, it's z^5 +1 =0, so the roots satisfy z^5 = -1. Therefore, each α_k^5 = -1, so α_k^4 = -1/α_k. Because α_k^5 = -1 implies α_k^4 = -1/α_k. So 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Therefore, 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Therefore, S = sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k) = - sum_{k=0}^4 α_k.

So now, S = - (α_0 + α_1 + α_2 + α_3 + α_4). But the sum of the roots of the polynomial z^5 +1 =0 is zero. Because in general, for a polynomial z^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} + ... + a_0 =0, the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}. In our case, the polynomial is z^5 +1, so coefficient a_{4} (the coefficient of z^4) is 0. Therefore, the sum of the roots is -0 = 0. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = 0. Therefore, S = -0 = 0. Wait, so S is zero? That would mean the total sum of residues is zero, so the integral is zero? But that seems counterintuitive. Let me check my steps again.

First, residue at each pole is 1/(5α^4). Then sum over residues is sum_{k=0}^4 1/(5α_k^4) = (1/5) sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4. Then I claimed that 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Let me verify that. Since α_k^5 = -1, so α_k^4 = (-1)/α_k. Therefore, 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Yes, that's correct. So 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4 = sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k) = - sum_{k=0}^4 α_k. And since the sum of the roots is zero, this sum is zero. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * (1/5)*0 = 0. So the integral is zero? Hmm.

But wait, let me check this again. Let me compute with specific examples. Suppose we have a simpler case, like integrating 1/(z^2 +1) around a circle of radius 2. The poles are at i and -i, residues are 1/(2i) and 1/(-2i), sum is zero, so integral is zero. But that's not the case for 1/(z^2 +1), the integral around |z|=2 would be 2πi*(1/(2i) + 1/(-2i)) = 2πi*0 = 0. But actually, the integral of 1/(z^2 +1) over a large circle should not be zero. Wait, but maybe in this case, the residues sum to zero. Wait, but that contradicts the residue theorem if there are poles inside the contour. Wait, but in the case of 1/(z^2 +1), the sum of residues is indeed zero, so the integral is zero. But actually, the integral around a circle that encloses both poles (which it does when radius is 2) would be zero. But if the circle only encloses one pole, the integral is π. Wait, but the residue sum is zero here. So maybe in this case, the integral is zero. So maybe in the case of z^5 +1, the sum of residues is zero, hence the integral is zero.

But let me test with another example. Let me take the integral of 1/(z^3 +1) around |z|=2. The roots of z^3 +1 =0 are the cube roots of -1, which are e^(iπ/3), e^(iπ), e^(i5π/3). So three poles. The residues at each pole would be 1/(3α^2). Then sum of residues would be (1/3)(1/α_0^2 + 1/α_1^2 + 1/α_2^2). Let's compute 1/α_k^2. Since α_k^3 = -1, so α_k^2 = -1/α_k. Therefore, 1/α_k^2 = -α_k. Therefore, sum of residues is (1/3)(-α_0 -α_1 -α_2) = - (1/3)(sum of roots). The sum of roots of z^3 +1 is - coefficient of z^2, which is 0. So again, sum of residues is zero, so integral is zero. So maybe in general, for functions of the form 1/(z^n +1), the integral around a circle large enough to enclose all poles is zero? Because the sum of residues would be zero.

But wait, is that always true? Let me check for n=1. If n=1, then 1/(z +1). The integral around |z|=2 would be 2πi * residue at -1, which is 1. So the integral is 2πi. So for n=1, it's not zero. So the previous pattern only holds for n≥2?

Wait, but in our case, n=5. So according to the previous reasoning, the integral is zero. But let me check with another approach. Maybe using substitution or another method to evaluate the integral.

Alternatively, consider that the integral over |z|=2 of 1/(z^5 +1) dz. Since |z|=2, we can parametrize z as 2e^{iθ}, θ from 0 to 2π. Then dz = 2i e^{iθ} dθ. So the integral becomes ∫0^{2π} [1/( (2e^{iθ})^5 +1 ) ] * 2i e^{iθ} dθ. Let me compute (2e^{iθ})^5 = 32 e^{i5θ}. So the integrand becomes 2i e^{iθ}/(32 e^{i5θ} +1). So the integral is ∫0^{2π} [2i e^{iθ} / (32 e^{i5θ} +1) ] dθ. Hmm, not sure if this helps. But maybe if we make a substitution w = e^{iθ}, then dw = i e^{iθ} dθ, so dθ = dw/(i w). But this might complicate things.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the residue theorem in another way. Wait, but if all poles are inside the contour, and the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero. But how can that be? Let me think of another example. For example, integrating 1/(z^2 +1) over a large circle. The residues at i and -i are 1/(2i) and 1/(-2i), which sum to zero, so integral is zero. So even though there are poles inside, the sum is zero. Similarly, for higher degrees, if the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero. So maybe for functions of the form 1/(z^n +1), the sum of residues is zero because the sum of roots is zero. Let me check.

For a general polynomial z^n +1 =0, the sum of roots is zero (since the coefficient of z^{n-1} is zero). Therefore, sum_{k=0}^{n-1} α_k =0. Then, using the same reasoning as before, the sum of residues for f(z)=1/(z^n +1) would be sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(n α_k^{n-1}) ). But since α_k^n = -1, then α_k^{n-1} = -1/α_k. Therefore, 1/(n α_k^{n-1}) = -α_k / n. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 1/(n α_k^{n-1}) = (-1/n) sum_{k=0}^{n-1} α_k = (-1/n)(0) =0. Therefore, the integral is zero. So regardless of n ≥2, the integral over a large enough circle is zero. So in this case, n=5, so the integral is zero.

Therefore, the answer is 0. But let me double-check. Wait, the user wrote ""Return your fina Evaluate the integral... where the contour is a circle of radius 2... \\frac{2}{3}"" Maybe there was a formatting error. The user might have intended to write the integral equals 2/3, but according to my calculation, it's zero. But let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the residue calculation. Let me verify. The residue at a simple pole z=α is lim_{z→α} (z - α) * f(z). For f(z)=1/(z^5 +1), which factors as (z - α) * Q(z), where Q(z) is the quotient polynomial. Then the residue is lim_{z→α} (z - α)/[(z - α) Q(z)] = 1/Q(α). But Q(α) is the derivative of the denominator at z=α, which is 5z^4. Therefore, the residue is 1/(5α^4). Which is what I had before. Then 1/α^4 = -α, since α^5 = -1. So 1/α^4 = -α. Therefore, sum of residues is (1/5) sum (-α) = - (1/5) sum α. But sum α is zero, so the total sum is zero. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 =0. Therefore, the answer should be 0. But why does the user have \\frac{2}{3} in the problem statement? Maybe that's a typo or part of a different problem. But according to my calculations, it's zero. Let me check with another method.

Alternatively, consider that the integrand is 1/(z^5 +1). If I consider the Laurent series expansion around each pole, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, note that the function is meromorphic, and since the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero. But wait, is there a different approach? For example, using the fact that the integral over a large circle can be evaluated by considering the behavior at infinity. For a function like 1/(z^5 +1), as |z| becomes very large, the function behaves like 1/z^5, so the integral around a large circle would be approximately ∫ |1/z^5| |dz|, which is O(1/R^4) as R→∞, so the integral tends to zero. But the contour here is radius 2, which is not extremely large, but still, the sum of residues is zero, so the integral is zero.

Wait, but in the case of 1/(z +1), the integral around a large circle is not zero, because there's a single pole, and the residue is 1, so the integral is 2πi. For higher degrees, when the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero. So unless there's a mistake in my reasoning, the integral should be zero. Therefore, the answer is 0. But let me check with a concrete example. Let me compute the integral numerically for a specific case. For example, take z^5 +1 =0, compute the residues, sum them up, and see if they are zero.

Alternatively, take a specific root, say α = e^(iπ/5). Then compute 1/(5α^4). Let's compute α^4. Since α^5 = -1, α^4 = -1/α. So 1/(5α^4) = -α/5. Similarly for all other roots. Therefore, the sum is - (α0 + α1 + α2 + α3 + α4)/5 = -0/5 =0. Therefore, the sum of residues is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is 0.

But the user wrote \\frac{2}{3} at the end. Maybe they intended a different problem, or there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the residue calculation. Let me check again.

Wait, perhaps I confused the residue formula. The residue at a simple pole z=α is lim_{z→α} (z - α) f(z). For f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1), then (z - α) f(z) = (z - α)/(z^5 +1). Since z^5 +1 = (z - α)(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4), then (z - α) f(z) = 1/(z^4 + α z^3 + α^2 z^2 + α^3 z + α^4) evaluated at z=α. Which is 1/(5α^4). So that's correct. Therefore, residue is 1/(5α^4). Then 1/α^4 = -α, so sum is sum (-α)/5 = (-1/5)(sum α) =0. So the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is 0. Therefore, the final answer is 0. But the user wrote \\frac{2}{3}. Maybe there was a mistake in the problem statement. Alternatively, maybe I should check again.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a different approach. Let's consider the integral over |z|=2 of 1/(z^5 +1) dz. If I make substitution w = 1/z, then when |z|=2, |w|=1/2. Then the integral becomes ∫ |w|=1/2 [1/( (1/w)^5 +1 ) ] * (-1/w^2) dw. Let's compute this:

First, dz = -1/w^2 dw. Then the integral becomes ∫_{|w|=1/2} [1/(1/w^5 +1)] * (-1/w^2) dw = ∫_{|w|=1/2} [ w^5 / (1 + w^5) ] * (-1/w^2) dw = ∫_{|w|=1/2} [ -w^3 / (1 + w^5) ] dw.

Now, the function inside the integral is -w^3/(1 + w^5). The denominator is 1 + w^5, so the poles are at the roots of w^5 = -1. But these roots have |w|=1, which is outside the contour |w|=1/2. Therefore, the integrand is analytic inside and on |w|=1/2, so the integral is zero by Cauchy's theorem. Therefore, the original integral is zero. Therefore, this confirms the previous result.

Therefore, the integral is zero. So the answer is 0. Therefore, the user's inclusion of \\frac{2}{3} might be an error or from a different problem. But according to the residue theorem and substitution method, the integral is zero.

The value of the integral is \\boxed{0}.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around the circle |z| = 2. Hmm, complex integrals can sometimes be tackled using residues, right? Let me recall. The residue theorem says that if you have a function that's analytic inside and on a simple closed contour except for a finite number of singularities inside the contour, then the integral is 2πi times the sum of the residues at those singularities.

First, I need to find the singularities of the function 1/(z^5 + 1). The denominator is zero when z^5 + 1 = 0, so z^5 = -1. The solutions to this equation are the fifth roots of -1. Let me write them down. The fifth roots of -1 can be expressed in polar form. Since -1 is e^{iπ}, the roots are e^{iπ(1 + 2k)/5} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So there are five poles, each at angles π/5, 3π/5, 5π/5=π, 7π/5, and 9π/5. Let me verify that. Yes, adding 2π/5 each time gives those angles. All these roots are on the unit circle because their magnitude is 1. Since the contour is a circle of radius 2, which is larger than 1, all these poles lie inside the contour. That's good because then I can apply the residue theorem directly.

Now, each of these poles is simple because the denominator z^5 + 1 has a derivative that is 5z^4, which is not zero at any of the roots (since z^4 would be 0 only if z=0, but the roots are on the unit circle, so z^4 is (e^{iθ})^4 = e^{i4θ}, which is not zero). Therefore, each pole is a simple pole, and I can compute the residue at each using the formula for simple poles: Res(f, α) = lim_{z→α} (z - α)f(z). Alternatively, since the denominator is z^5 + 1, maybe there's a more straightforward way.

Wait, for a function of the form 1/(z^n + a), the residue at a root α (where α^n = -a) can be calculated by differentiating the denominator. Let me recall that formula. If f(z) = 1/(g(z)) and g(z) has a simple zero at α, then Res(f, α) = 1/g'(α). So in this case, g(z) = z^5 + 1, so g'(z) = 5z^4. Therefore, Res(f, α) = 1/(5α^4). So the residue at each pole α is 1/(5α^4).

But then, since α^5 = -1, we can express α^4 as α^4 = (α^5)/α = (-1)/α. Therefore, Res(f, α) = 1/(5*(-1)/α) ) = -α/(5). So each residue simplifies to -α/(5). That seems useful. So the residue at each pole α is -α/5.

Therefore, the integral is 2πi times the sum of all residues. So the integral equals 2πi * sum_{k=0 to 4} (-α_k)/5, where α_k are the fifth roots of -1. Let's denote the sum of the residues as S = sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k)/5 = (-1/5) sum_{k=0}^4 α_k.

Now, what is the sum of the roots of the equation z^5 + 1 = 0? The equation is z^5 = -1, which is the same as z^5 + 1 = 0. The sum of the roots of a polynomial equation is given by -coefficient of z^4 divided by coefficient of z^5. But in this case, the polynomial is z^5 + 1, which has no z^4 term. So the sum of the roots is 0. Wait, but the roots here are the fifth roots of -1, which are the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0. Therefore, the sum of the roots is -0 (since the coefficient of z^4 is 0), so sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = 0. Therefore, the sum S = (-1/5)*0 = 0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check. If the sum of the residues is zero, then the integral is zero. But maybe I made a mistake in the residue calculation.

Wait, the residue at each pole is -α/5, and the sum of all α's is zero, so the sum of residues is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. Is that correct?

Alternatively, maybe there's another approach. For example, since the function 1/(z^5 + 1) is a rational function, and the contour is a circle of radius 2, which encloses all singularities. Alternatively, maybe using the residue at infinity? But that might complicate things. Alternatively, think about the integral over a keyhole contour or something, but that seems more involved.

Wait, but according to the residue theorem, if all residues inside the contour sum to zero, the integral is zero. So is there a mistake in the reasoning here?

Wait, let's check again. The roots are the fifth roots of -1, which are located at angles π/5, 3π/5, π, 7π/5, and 9π/5. So their sum is indeed zero. Because for any polynomial equation, the sum of roots is equal to the negative coefficient of z^(n-1) divided by the coefficient of z^n. In this case, the polynomial is z^5 + 1, so the sum of roots is zero. Therefore, yes, sum α_k = 0. Therefore, the sum of residues is zero, hence the integral is zero.

But wait, maybe I should check with a specific example. Let's take a simpler case where we know the integral. For example, if the integral was around |z|=1, but that's smaller than the unit circle, but in our case, it's |z|=2. Wait, but the radius is 2, which is larger than 1, so all poles are inside. So according to residue theorem, the integral is 2πi times sum of residues. If sum of residues is zero, integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there's an alternative approach using symmetry. The function 1/(z^5 +1) has some symmetry? Let me see. If we consider the substitution w = 1/z, then the integral becomes... Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, note that the function is not an even function, so symmetry might not help here.

Alternatively, another way to compute the integral is using the residue at infinity. The residue at infinity is defined as -Res(f, 0), where f(1/z) * (1/z^2). Let me compute that.

So, f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1). Then f(1/z) = 1/( (1/z)^5 +1 ) = z^5/(1 + z^5). Therefore, f(1/z) * (1/z^2) = z^5/(1 + z^5) * 1/z^2 = z^3/(1 + z^5). The residue of this at z=0 is the coefficient of z^{-1} in the Laurent expansion. Let's expand z^3/(1 + z^5). Since 1/(1 + z^5) can be written as 1 - z^5 + z^{10} - z^{15} + ... for |z| <1. Therefore, z^3/(1 + z^5) = z^3 - z^8 + z^{13} - z^{18} + ... So the Laurent series has no term with z^{-1}, so the residue at z=0 is zero. Therefore, the residue at infinity is -Res(f,0) = -0 = 0. Therefore, the integral over the contour is 2πi times (sum of residues inside plus residue at infinity) = 0. Wait, but residue at infinity is already accounted for in the residue theorem if you close the contour, but in this case, since the function is rational, maybe the integral can be evaluated as 2πi times the sum of residues inside, and since the residue at infinity is zero, the sum of residues inside is equal to -residue at infinity. Wait, maybe not. Wait, the residue at infinity is defined as -Res(f(1/z)/z^2, 0). So if the residue at infinity is zero, then sum of residues inside is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I can check with a parametrization. Let me parametrize z = 2e^{iθ}, θ from 0 to 2π. Then the integral becomes ∫0^{2π} [1/( (2e^{iθ})^5 +1 ) ] * 2i e^{iθ} dθ. But this seems complicated to compute directly. Alternatively, maybe use the fact that the integral over a large circle is equal to the sum of residues inside, but since we found that the sum is zero, maybe the integral is zero.

But let me think again. Suppose I have a function with all residues summing to zero. Is it possible that the integral is zero? Yes, for example, if the function is analytic inside the contour, the integral is zero. But if there are poles, but their residues cancel out, then the integral is zero. So in this case, even though there are five poles, their residues add up to zero, so the integral is zero. That seems correct.

But let me verify this with another approach. Let's compute the integral directly using the residue theorem. The function is 1/(z^5 +1), with poles at the fifth roots of -1. Each residue is -α/5. Sum of residues is (-1/5) sum α_k = (-1/5)(0) = 0. Therefore, integral is 2πi * 0 = 0. So the answer is zero. But the user mentioned ""Return your final answer with \\boxed{}"". The initial problem had a fraction 2/3, but maybe that was a mistake. Wait, looking back at the problem statement: ""Evaluate the integral ∮_{|z|=2} 1/(z^5+1) dz where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. \\frac{2}{3}"". Wait, the \\frac{2}{3} seems out of place. Maybe it's a typo or part of the problem. Wait, no, maybe the user intended to write the problem and then included a fraction, but in the problem statement, the integral is of 1/(z^5 +1). So the answer is zero. But perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement, or maybe I misread it.

Wait, double-check the problem. The integral is of 1/(z^5 +1) dz, over |z|=2. The answer is zero. However, the user wrote ""Return your fina Evaluate the integral... \\frac{2}{3}"". Maybe there was a formatting error. If the integral was of z/(z^5 +1), then the answer would be different. But as stated, it's 1/(z^5 +1). Therefore, unless there's a miscalculation, the answer is zero.

Wait, but let me check again. Let me compute the residue at each pole again. Suppose α is a root of z^5 = -1. Then z^5 = -1, so z^5 +1 =0. The function is 1/(z^5 +1). The residue at α is 1/(5α^4). Since α^5 = -1, α^4 = α^{-1} (since α^5 = -1 => α^4 = -α^{-1}). Therefore, 1/(5α^4) = 1/(5*(-α^{-1})) = -α/5. So each residue is -α/5. Therefore, sum of residues is sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k)/5 = (-1/5) sum α_k. Since sum α_k =0, sum residues=0. Therefore, integral is zero. So yes, answer is zero. Therefore, the user might have a typo, but the correct answer is zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem was meant to be 1/(z^5 -1), but no, the user wrote z^5 +1. Alternatively, maybe the integral is over a different contour, but the user said |z|=2, which is correct. Therefore, the answer is zero. Therefore, I should write \\boxed{0}.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{1}{z^5+1} \\, dz \\) where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, we use the residue theorem.

These roots are the fifth roots of -1, given by \\( z = e^{i\\pi(1 + 2k)/5} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). All these roots lie on the unit circle, so they are inside the contour \\( |z| = 2 \\).

The residue at each simple pole \\( \\alpha \\) (where \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\)) is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{5\\alpha^4} \\). Using the fact that \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\), we find \\( \\alpha^4 = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\). Therefore, the residue at each pole simplifies to \\( -\\frac{\\alpha}{5} \\).

The sum of the roots of the polynomial \\( z^5 + 1 \\) is zero (by Vieta's formulas), so the sum of the residues is zero. Applying the residue theorem, the integral is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral ∮_{|z|=2} 1/(z^5 + 1) dz. Hmm, complex integrals can be tricky, but I remember that when the contour is a circle around the origin, the residue theorem is a good approach. Let me recall the residue theorem: the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function at its poles inside the contour.

First, I need to figure out where the poles of the function 1/(z^5 + 1) are. The poles occur when the denominator is zero, so solving z^5 + 1 = 0. That equation can be rewritten as z^5 = -1. The solutions to this are the fifth roots of -1. Since -1 is e^{iπ + 2πik} for integer k, the fifth roots would be e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So there are five poles, each located at angles π/5, 3π/5, 5π/5=π, 7π/5, 9π/5, all with magnitude 1, right? So these are points on the unit circle.

But wait, the contour here is |z|=2, which is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. So all these poles are inside the contour since their magnitudes are 1, which is less than 2. Therefore, the residue theorem tells me that the integral is 2πi times the sum of the residues at each of these five poles.

So now, I need to compute the residues at each of these poles. Since each pole is simple (the denominator has simple zeros here because the derivative of z^5 + 1 at each root is 5z^4, which is non-zero for z ≠ 0), the residue at each pole z_k is given by the limit as z approaches z_k of (z - z_k)/(z^5 + 1). Alternatively, using the formula for residue at a simple pole: Res(f, z_k) = 1/(5z_k^4). Let me verify that.

Yes, if f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1), then the residue at a simple pole z_k is the derivative of the denominator evaluated at z_k (if the numerator is 1), so Res(f, z_k) = 1 / (d/dz (z^5 + 1)|_{z=z_k}) = 1/(5z_k^4). That seems right.

So now, I need to compute the sum over k=0 to 4 of 1/(5z_k^4) and then multiply by 2πi. Let's denote the sum S = Σ_{k=0}^4 1/(5z_k^4). So the integral is 2πi * S.

But maybe there's a smarter way to compute this sum without calculating each residue individually. Let me think. Since z_k are the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0, we can write z^5 = -1 for each z_k. Therefore, z_k^5 = -1, so z_k^5 + 1 = 0. Let me see if there's a relation between the residues.

Alternatively, maybe using symmetry properties. The residues are 1/(5z_k^4). Let's note that z_k are the fifth roots of -1, so they are e^{i(π + 2πk)/5}. Let me write them as z_k = e^{iθ_k}, where θ_k = (π + 2πk)/5. Then, z_k^4 = e^{i4θ_k} = e^{i4(π + 2πk)/5} = e^{i(4π + 8πk)/5} = e^{i(4π/5 + 8πk/5)}. Wait, maybe this is complicating things.

Alternatively, since z_k^5 = -1, then z_k^4 = z_k^{-1} * z_k^5 = z_k^{-1} * (-1). Wait, z_k^5 = -1, so z_k^4 = z_k^{-1} * (-1). Let me check that: z_k^5 = -1 => z_k^4 = -1/z_k. So 1/(z_k^4) = -z_k. Therefore, the residue at each z_k is 1/(5z_k^4) = -z_k / 5.

Oh, that's a useful simplification! So instead of calculating each residue as 1/(5z_k^4), which might be tedious, I can express it as -z_k/5. Therefore, the sum S is Σ_{k=0}^4 (-z_k)/5 = (-1/5) Σ_{k=0}^4 z_k.

So now, the problem reduces to computing the sum of the roots z_k of the equation z^5 + 1 = 0. Wait, the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0 are the fifth roots of -1, which are the same as the roots of z^5 = -1. The sum of the roots of a polynomial equation can be found using Vieta's formula. For the polynomial z^5 + 1 = 0, the sum of the roots is equal to -coefficient of z^4 / coefficient of z^5. Since the polynomial is z^5 + 0z^4 + 0z^3 + 0z^2 + 0z + 1, the sum of the roots is -0/1 = 0. Therefore, Σ_{k=0}^4 z_k = 0. Therefore, the sum S = (-1/5)(0) = 0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. If the sum of the poles is zero, then the sum of residues is zero, hence the integral is zero. But is this correct?

Alternatively, let me check for a specific example. Suppose I take a simpler case, like ∮_{|z|=2} 1/(z^2 + 1) dz. The poles are at i and -i, sum of residues is (1/(2i) + 1/(-2i)) = 0, hence the integral is zero. So in that case, it works. Similarly, for the fifth roots of -1, their sum is zero, so the integral should be zero. Therefore, the answer is 0. But let me double-check.

Wait, but maybe the sum of the residues isn't the same as the sum of the roots. Wait, in the case of the polynomial z^5 + 1, the sum of the roots is zero. But the residues here are -z_k /5. So the sum of residues is (-1/5)(sum of z_k) = 0. Therefore, the integral is zero. So the answer is zero. Hmm.

But let me compute it another way. Let's compute the residues individually. Let's take z_k = e^{iθ_k}, where θ_k = (π + 2πk)/5, for k=0,1,2,3,4. Then, the residue at each z_k is 1/(5z_k^4). So let's compute 1/(5z_k^4):

z_k^4 = e^{i4θ_k} = e^{i4(π + 2πk)/5} = e^{i(4π + 8πk)/5} = e^{i(4π/5 + 8πk/5)}. So 1/(5z_k^4) = 1/(5e^{i(4π/5 + 8πk/5)}) = (1/5)e^{-i(4π/5 + 8πk/5)}.

Therefore, each residue is (1/5)e^{-i(4π/5 + 8πk/5)}. Then, the sum of residues is (1/5) Σ_{k=0}^4 e^{-i(4π/5 + 8πk/5)}.

Let me compute the sum Σ_{k=0}^4 e^{-i(4π/5 + 8πk/5)}. Let's factor out e^{-i4π/5}:

Σ_{k=0}^4 e^{-i4π/5} e^{-i8πk/5} = e^{-i4π/5} Σ_{k=0}^4 e^{-i8πk/5}.

Now, the sum Σ_{k=0}^4 e^{-i8πk/5} is a geometric series with ratio e^{-i8π/5}. Let's compute that. The sum of a geometric series Σ_{k=0}^n r^k = (1 - r^{n+1})/(1 - r). Here, n=4, so:

Σ_{k=0}^4 e^{-i8πk/5} = (1 - e^{-i8π/5 *5})/(1 - e^{-i8π/5}) = (1 - e^{-i8π})/(1 - e^{-i8π/5}).

But e^{-i8π} = e^{-i2π*4} = 1. Therefore, the numerator is 1 - 1 = 0, so the entire sum is zero. Therefore, the sum Σ_{k=0}^4 e^{-i(4π/5 + 8πk/5)} is zero. Therefore, the sum of the residues is (1/5)*0 = 0. Hence, the integral is zero.

So both methods agree. Therefore, the integral is zero.

Alternatively, another approach: since the function 1/(z^5 + 1) is analytic everywhere except at those five poles inside |z|=2, and the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero.

But wait, just to make sure, maybe I can use another theorem. For example, if the integrand is a rational function where the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator by at least 2, then the integral over a large circle is zero. In this case, the integrand is 1/(z^5 + 1), which for large |z| behaves like 1/z^5. The integral over a circle of radius R would be approximately the circumference 2πR times 1/R^5, so 2π/R^4, which goes to zero as R approaches infinity. But our contour is fixed at R=2, but maybe using this idea, but in our case, the integral is over a fixed contour, not a limit as R goes to infinity. However, since the function is meromorphic inside the contour, and the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe using the fact that the function is even or has some symmetry. Wait, 1/(z^5 + 1) doesn't have even symmetry. Hmm.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the integral over a closed contour can be related to the sum of residues, but in this case, since the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe parametrize the integral and compute it directly, but that seems complicated. Let's see. The integral is around |z|=2, so parametrize z = 2e^{iθ}, θ from 0 to 2π. Then dz = 2i e^{iθ} dθ. So the integral becomes ∫0^{2π} 1/( (2e^{iθ})^5 + 1 ) * 2i e^{iθ} dθ. But this seems messy. Let me compute (2e^{iθ})^5 = 32 e^{i5θ}, so the denominator is 32 e^{i5θ} + 1. So the integrand is 1/(32 e^{i5θ} + 1) * 2i e^{iθ} dθ. This doesn't look easily integrable. So maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps consider the function f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1). Then, integrating f(z) over a large contour, but again, not helpful here.

Alternatively, check if the function has any anti-derivatives. But 1/(z^5 + 1) is a rational function, and integrating such functions around a closed contour gives the sum of residues, which we already found to be zero.

Therefore, after multiple methods and checks, I conclude that the integral is zero. The key insight was recognizing that the sum of the poles (roots of z^5 + 1) is zero due to Vieta's formula, which led to the sum of residues being zero, hence the integral is zero.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around the circle |z| = 2. Hmm, complex integrals can be tricky, but I remember something about residues and the residue theorem. Let me try to recall. 

First, the integral is a contour integral, and the function is 1/(z^5 + 1). The contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin. Since the radius is 2, which is larger than the magnitude of the poles of the function, I need to find all the poles of the function inside this circle and then apply the residue theorem. 

Wait, the poles of 1/(z^5 + 1) occur where z^5 + 1 = 0, so at the fifth roots of -1. That is, the solutions to z^5 = -1. The fifth roots of -1 can be found using Euler's formula. Let me think. Since -1 in polar form is e^{iπ + 2πik} for integer k. So the fifth roots would be e^{iπ(1 + 2k)/5} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That gives me five roots: e^{iπ/5}, e^{i3π/5}, e^{i5π/5} = e^{iπ} = -1, e^{i7π/5}, e^{i9π/5}. 

So these are the five poles. Now, since the contour is |z| = 2, which is a circle with radius 2, all these poles are inside the contour because their magnitudes are 1, which is less than 2. So all five poles are enclosed by the contour. Therefore, by the residue theorem, the integral is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues at all these poles. 

Now, I need to compute the residues at each of these five poles. Since each pole is a simple pole (since the denominator is z^5 + 1, which has simple zeros at these roots), the residue at each pole z = α is given by lim_{z→α} (z - α)/(z^5 + 1). 

Alternatively, there's a formula for the residue at a simple pole: Res(f, α) = 1/(5α^4), since the derivative of the denominator is 5z^4. Let me confirm that. If f(z) = 1/(g(z)) where g(z) has a simple zero at α, then Res(f, α) = 1/g'(α). Here, g(z) = z^5 + 1, so g'(z) = 5z^4. Therefore, Res(f, α) = 1/(5α^4). 

So for each pole α_k = e^{iπ(1 + 2k)/5} where k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, the residue is 1/(5α_k^4). 

But maybe there's a smarter way to compute the sum of residues without calculating each one individually. Let me think. 

Alternatively, since the function is 1/(z^5 + 1), and we are integrating around a contour that encloses all poles, perhaps we can use the fact that the integral around a large contour can be related to the residues at the poles, but maybe there's a way to compute the integral directly or use another theorem. Wait, but since all poles are enclosed, residue theorem is the way to go. 

But summing the residues might be tedious. Let me see if there's a pattern. 

Alternatively, consider that the sum of residues of 1/(z^5 + 1) is equal to the sum over all poles of 1/(5α^4). Let me denote the residues as R_k = 1/(5α_k^4). So the sum is (1/5) * sum_{k=0}^4 (α_k^{-4}). 

Now, α_k are the roots of z^5 = -1. So each α_k^5 = -1. Therefore, α_k^{-5} = (-1)^{-1} = -1. But α_k^{-4} = α_k^{1}, because α_k^{-4} = α_k^{5 - 4} = α_k^{1} since α_k^5 = -1. Wait, is that right? Let me check. If α_k^5 = -1, then α_k^5 = -1, so multiplying both sides by α_k^{-4}, we get α_k = -α_k^{-4}. Therefore, α_k^{-4} = -α_k. 

Ah, so α_k^{-4} = -α_k. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 α_k^{-4} = - sum_{k=0}^4 α_k. 

Therefore, the sum of residues is (1/5) * (- sum_{k=0}^4 α_k). 

So now, I need to compute the sum of the roots α_0, α_1, α_2, α_3, α_4. 

But these roots are the fifth roots of -1. So they are the solutions to z^5 + 1 = 0. The sum of the roots of a polynomial equation z^5 + a z^4 + b z^3 + c z^2 + d z + e = 0 is -a. In this case, the polynomial is z^5 + 0 z^4 + 0 z^3 + 0 z^2 + 0 z + 1 = 0. So the sum of the roots is -0 = 0. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = 0. 

Therefore, the sum of residues is (1/5) * (-0) = 0. 

Wait, so the sum of residues is zero? Then the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0. 

But that seems surprising. Is the integral zero? Let me check if there's an error in the reasoning. 

First, the key step was that α_k^{-4} = -α_k. Let me verify that. Since α_k^5 = -1, then α_k^5 + 1 = 0. So α_k^5 = -1. Therefore, multiplying both sides by α_k^{-4}, we get α_k = -α_k^{-4}. So indeed, α_k^{-4} = -α_k. Therefore, sum α_k^{-4} = - sum α_k. 

Since the sum of the roots is zero, then sum residues is (1/5)(-0) = 0. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

But wait, let me cross-check this with another method. Maybe using the residue theorem in a different way. 

Alternatively, consider that the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around a large contour. But since our contour is |z| = 2, which is large enough to enclose all poles. Alternatively, maybe use the substitution w = 1/z, but I'm not sure. 

Alternatively, note that the function 1/(z^5 + 1) has poles at the fifth roots of -1, which are equally spaced on the unit circle. The sum of residues at these poles is zero because the sum of the roots is zero, as we saw. Therefore, the integral is zero. 

But let me also think about the integral of a meromorphic function around a contour. If the function has no poles inside the contour, the integral is zero. But here, there are poles, but their residues sum to zero. 

Alternatively, maybe we can use symmetry. The function is 1/(z^5 + 1). If we integrate around the unit circle, but our contour is radius 2. However, the key point is that the residues sum to zero. 

But let me check with another approach. Let's consider the integral over the unit circle, |z| = 1. Then, since the poles are on the unit circle, but the integral would be different. However, our problem is about |z|=2. 

Alternatively, use the residue theorem for the entire plane. The integral around a large contour can be related to the residue at infinity. But the residue at infinity is given by -Res(1/f(z), 0), where f(z) is the function. Wait, maybe not. Let me recall. The residue at infinity is defined as -Res(1/(z^2 f(1/z)), 0). 

But maybe this approach complicates things. Alternatively, note that if all residues are zero, then the integral is zero. But in our case, the sum of residues is zero, so the integral is zero. 

But is there another way to see this? Let me consider that the function 1/(z^5 + 1) is a rational function. For rational functions, the integral around a large contour can be related to the residues at the poles. But in this case, since all poles are enclosed by |z|=2, and the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero. 

Alternatively, consider that the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) over a closed contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of residues inside. If the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero. 

Alternatively, maybe compute the integral directly using parametrization, but that seems difficult. 

Alternatively, consider that the function is meromorphic, and the integral over a closed contour is determined by residues. Since the residues sum to zero, the integral is zero. 

Therefore, the answer should be zero. 

But let me check with specific residues. Let's take one pole, say α = e^{iπ/5}. Then the residue at α is 1/(5α^4). Let's compute α^4: (e^{iπ/5})^4 = e^{i4π/5}. So residue is 1/(5 e^{i4π/5}) = e^{-i4π/5}/5. Similarly, for the other poles, their residues would be e^{-i4π/5}/5, e^{-i12π/5}/5, e^{-i20π/5}/5, e^{-i28π/5}/5. Wait, but 20π/5 is 4π, which is equivalent to 0, so e^{-i20π/5} = e^{-i4π} = 1. Let me compute each residue:

For α_0 = e^{iπ/5}, residue R0 = 1/(5(e^{iπ/5})^4) = 1/(5 e^{i4π/5}) = e^{-i4π/5}/5.

Similarly, α_1 = e^{i3π/5}, residue R1 = 1/(5(e^{i3π/5})^4) = e^{-i12π/5}/5.

But 12π/5 = 2π + 2π/5, so e^{-i12π/5} = e^{-i2π/5} = e^{-i2π/5}.

Wait, e^{-i12π/5} = e^{-i(2π + 2π/5)} = e^{-i2π/5} since e^{-i2π} = 1.

Similarly, α_2 = e^{i5π/5} = e^{iπ} = -1. Residue R2 = 1/(5(-1)^4) = 1/(5*1) = 1/5.

Wait, but hold on. α_2 is -1, so z = -1. Then the residue is 1/(5*(-1)^4) = 1/(5*1) = 1/5.

Similarly, α_3 = e^{i7π/5}, residue R3 = 1/(5(e^{i7π/5})^4) = e^{-i28π/5}/5 = e^{-i(5π + 3π/5)} = e^{-i3π/5}/5.

Similarly, α_4 = e^{i9π/5}, residue R4 = 1/(5(e^{i9π/5})^4) = e^{-i36π/5}/5 = e^{-i36π/5} = e^{-i(7π + π/5)} = e^{-iπ/5}/5.

So now, let's list all residues:

R0 = e^{-i4π/5}/5

R1 = e^{-i2π/5}/5

R2 = 1/5

R3 = e^{-i3π/5}/5

R4 = e^{-iπ/5}/5

Now, summing these residues:

Sum = (e^{-i4π/5} + e^{-i2π/5} + 1 + e^{-i3π/5} + e^{-iπ/5}) /5

Let me compute the numerator:

Numerator = e^{-i4π/5} + e^{-i2π/5} + 1 + e^{-i3π/5} + e^{-iπ/5}

Note that e^{-iπ/5} = cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

Similarly, e^{-i2π/5} = cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5)

e^{-i3π/5} = cos(3π/5) - i sin(3π/5) = -cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5)

e^{-i4π/5} = cos(4π/5) - i sin(4π/5) = -cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

So let's compute the sum:

Real parts:

cos(π/5) + cos(2π/5) + 1 + (-cos(2π/5)) + (-cos(π/5)) 

= [cos(π/5) - cos(π/5)] + [cos(2π/5) - cos(2π/5)] + 1 

= 0 + 0 + 1 = 1

Imaginary parts:

-sin(π/5) - sin(2π/5) - sin(3π/5) - sin(4π/5)

But sin(3π/5) = sin(π - 2π/5) = sin(2π/5)

Similarly, sin(4π/5) = sin(π - π/5) = sin(π/5)

Therefore, sin(3π/5) = sin(2π/5), sin(4π/5) = sin(π/5)

Thus, imaginary parts:

-sin(π/5) - sin(2π/5) - sin(2π/5) - sin(π/5) = -2 sin(π/5) - 2 sin(2π/5)

But let's compute this:

Sum = -2[sin(π/5) + sin(2π/5)]

But sin(π/5) + sin(3π/5) = 2 sin(2π/5) cos(π/5) by sum-to-product formula. Wait, but here we have sin(π/5) + sin(2π/5). Let me compute numerically:

sin(π/5) ≈ 0.5878

sin(2π/5) ≈ 0.9511

So sum ≈ 0.5878 + 0.9511 ≈ 1.5389

Multiply by -2: -3.0778

Therefore, the imaginary part is approximately -3.0778

But let's check if this sum is zero. Wait, but earlier we thought that the sum of residues is zero. But here, when calculating the residues directly, the sum seems to have a real part of 1 and an imaginary part of approximately -3.0778. But according to our previous conclusion, the sum should be zero. There's a contradiction here. 

Wait, so where is the mistake? Let me check again. 

Earlier, we used the fact that sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = 0, hence sum residues = (1/5)(- sum α_k) = 0. But according to the direct calculation, the residues sum to (1 + imaginary terms)/5. So either the direct calculation is wrong, or the previous reasoning was flawed. 

Wait, perhaps the mistake was in assuming that sum_{k=0}^4 α_k^{-4} = - sum_{k=0}^4 α_k. Let me re-examine that step. 

Given that α_k^5 = -1, we have α_k^5 + 1 = 0. Then, multiplying both sides by α_k^{-4}, we get α_k = -α_k^{-4}. Therefore, α_k^{-4} = -α_k. Therefore, sum α_k^{-4} = - sum α_k. Since sum α_k = 0, then sum residues = (1/5)(-0) = 0. Therefore, the residues should sum to zero. 

But according to the direct calculation, the sum is (1 - 2[sin(π/5) + sin(2π/5)])/5. But this is approximately (1 - 2*(0.5878 + 0.9511))/5 ≈ (1 - 2*(1.5389))/5 ≈ (1 - 3.0778)/5 ≈ (-2.0778)/5 ≈ -0.41556, which is not zero. 

Therefore, there must be an error in the previous reasoning. 

Wait, let's check the residue formula again. For a function f(z) = 1/(z^5 + 1), the residues at the poles z = α_k are Res(f, α_k) = 1/(5α_k^4). But earlier, we used the fact that α_k^{-4} = -α_k. However, if α_k^5 = -1, then α_k^{-1} = α_k^4, so α_k^{-4} = (α_k^{-1})^4 = (α_k^4)^4 = α_k^{16} = α_k^{15 + 1} = (α_k^5)^3 * α_k = (-1)^3 * α_k = -α_k. Therefore, indeed, α_k^{-4} = -α_k. Therefore, sum residues = (1/5) * sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k) = (1/5)(- sum α_k) = (1/5)(-0) = 0. 

Therefore, the sum of residues should be zero. But according to the direct calculation, it's not. Therefore, there's a mistake in the direct calculation. 

Wait, let's recompute the residues. 

Take α_0 = e^{iπ/5}. Then:

Res(f, α_0) = 1/(5α_0^4) = 1/(5 e^{i4π/5}) = e^{-i4π/5}/5.

Similarly, α_1 = e^{i3π/5}:

Res(f, α_1) = 1/(5 e^{i12π/5}) = e^{-i12π/5}/5 = e^{-i(2π + 2π/5)} = e^{-i2π/5}/5.

α_2 = e^{iπ} = -1:

Res(f, α_2) = 1/(5*(-1)^4) = 1/(5*1) = 1/5.

α_3 = e^{i7π/5} = e^{i(2π - 3π/5)} = e^{-i3π/5}:

Res(f, α_3) = 1/(5 e^{-i12π/5}) = e^{i12π/5}/5 = e^{i(2π + 2π/5)} = e^{i2π/5}/5. Wait, hold on. Wait, the residue at α_3 is Res(f, α_3) = 1/(5α_3^4). Since α_3 = e^{i7π/5}, then α_3^4 = e^{i28π/5} = e^{i(5π + 3π/5)} = e^{i(5π + 3π/5)} = e^{i(5π + 3π/5)}. Wait, 28π/5 = 5π + 3π/5. But e^{i5π} = e^{iπ} = -1. So e^{i28π/5} = e^{i5π + i3π/5} = e^{i5π} * e^{i3π/5} = -e^{i3π/5}. Therefore, Res(f, α_3) = 1/(5*(-e^{i3π/5})) = -e^{-i3π/5}/5.

Similarly, for α_4 = e^{i9π/5} = e^{i(2π - π/5)} = e^{-iπ/5}:

Res(f, α_4) = 1/(5α_4^4) = 1/(5 e^{-i4π/5}) = e^{i4π/5}/5.

Wait, so let's recast the residues:

R0 = e^{-i4π/5}/5

R1 = e^{-i2π/5}/5

R2 = 1/5

R3 = -e^{-i3π/5}/5

R4 = e^{i4π/5}/5

Now, summing these:

Sum = [e^{-i4π/5} + e^{-i2π/5} + 1 + (-e^{-i3π/5}) + e^{i4π/5}]/5

Let's compute each term:

e^{-i4π/5} = e^{-i(4π/5)} = cos(4π/5) - i sin(4π/5) = -cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

e^{-i2π/5} = e^{-i(2π/5)} = cos(2π/5) - i sin(2π/5)

1 = 1

-e^{-i3π/5} = -[cos(3π/5) - i sin(3π/5)] = -cos(3π/5) + i sin(3π/5)

e^{i4π/5} = e^{i(4π/5)} = cos(4π/5) + i sin(4π/5) = -cos(π/5) + i sin(π/5)

Now, let's sum the real parts:

Real parts:

- cos(π/5) + cos(2π/5) + 1 - cos(3π/5) - cos(4π/5)

But cos(3π/5) = cos(π - 2π/5) = -cos(2π/5)

cos(4π/5) = cos(π - π/5) = -cos(π/5)

Therefore, substituting:

Real parts:

- cos(π/5) + cos(2π/5) + 1 - (-cos(2π/5)) - (-cos(π/5))

= -cos(π/5) + cos(2π/5) + 1 + cos(2π/5) + cos(π/5)

= [ -cos(π/5) + cos(π/5) ] + [ cos(2π/5) + cos(2π/5) ] + 1

= 0 + 2 cos(2π/5) + 1

Now, 2 cos(2π/5) is approximately 2 * 0.3090 ≈ 0.618, so total real part ≈ 0.618 + 1 ≈ 1.618

Imaginary parts:

- sin(π/5) - sin(2π/5) + sin(3π/5) + sin(4π/5)

But sin(3π/5) = sin(π - 2π/5) = sin(2π/5)

sin(4π/5) = sin(π - π/5) = sin(π/5)

Therefore, substituting:

Imaginary parts:

- sin(π/5) - sin(2π/5) + sin(2π/5) + sin(π/5)

= [ -sin(π/5) + sin(π/5) ] + [ -sin(2π/5) + sin(2π/5) ]

= 0 + 0 = 0

Therefore, total sum is (1.618 + 0i)/5 ≈ 0.3236 + 0i

But this is not zero. So there's a contradiction here. 

Wait, that's confusing. According to the residue theorem, the integral should be 2πi times the sum of residues, which would be 2πi * (1.618/5) ≈ 2πi * 0.3236 ≈ 2πi * 0.3236 ≈ 2.034i. But according to the previous reasoning, the sum should be zero. 

So where is the mistake? 

Wait, the key step was that sum_{k=0}^4 α_k^{-4} = - sum_{k=0}^4 α_k. But in reality, when we computed the residues directly, the sum was not zero. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the algebraic manipulation. 

Let me check again. 

Given that α_k^5 = -1, then α_k^5 + 1 = 0. Therefore, α_k^5 = -1. Multiply both sides by α_k^{-4}: α_k = -α_k^{-4}. Therefore, α_k^{-4} = -α_k. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 α_k^{-4} = - sum_{k=0}^4 α_k. 

But sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = 0, as they are the roots of z^5 + 1 = 0, whose sum is zero (since the coefficient of z^4 is zero). Therefore, sum residues = (1/5)(-0) = 0. 

But according to the direct residues computation, the sum is not zero. Therefore, there must be an error in the direct residues calculation. 

Wait, let's re-examine the residues. 

For each pole α_k, the residue is 1/(5α_k^4). 

But α_k^5 = -1, so α_k^4 = α_k^4. Let's write α_k^4 = (α_k^5)/α_k = (-1)/α_k. Therefore, 1/α_k^4 = -α_k. Therefore, residue at α_k is 1/(5α_k^4) = -α_k/5. 

Therefore, the residue at each pole is -α_k/5. Therefore, sum residues = sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k)/5 = (-1/5) sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = (-1/5)(0) = 0. 

Ah! This is the key. The residue at each pole is -α_k/5, so the sum of residues is (-1/5)(sum α_k) = 0. 

But when we computed the residues directly earlier, we didn't get this. So why the discrepancy? 

Wait, let's check this again. 

If the residue at α_k is 1/(5α_k^4), and since α_k^4 = -1/α_k (from α_k^5 = -1), then 1/(5α_k^4) = -α_k/5. Therefore, residues are -α_k/5. 

Therefore, sum residues = -1/5 sum α_k = 0. 

Therefore, the previous mistake was in the direct computation of residues. 

Wait, let's recast the residues correctly. 

Given that α_k^5 = -1, then α_k^4 = -1/α_k. Therefore, 1/(5α_k^4) = 1/(5*(-1/α_k)) = -α_k/5. 

Therefore, each residue is -α_k/5. Therefore, sum residues = (-1/5)(α_0 + α_1 + α_2 + α_3 + α_4) = (-1/5)(0) = 0. 

Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0. 

But why when I computed the residues directly, I got a non-zero sum? Because I must have made a mistake in the residue calculations. 

Wait, let's check the residue at α_2 = -1. 

Res(f, α_2) = 1/(5*(-1)^4) = 1/(5*1) = 1/5. But according to the formula, it should be -α_2/5 = -(-1)/5 = 1/5. That's correct. 

Similarly, for α_0 = e^{iπ/5}, residue should be -α_0/5 = -e^{iπ/5}/5. But earlier, I computed it as e^{-i4π/5}/5. Let's see if these are equal. 

From α_k^5 = -1, α_k^4 = -1/α_k. Therefore, 1/(5α_k^4) = -α_k/5. Therefore, residue is -α_k/5. 

But in the previous direct calculation, I had:

Res(f, α_0) = 1/(5 e^{i4π/5}) = e^{-i4π/5}/5

But according to the formula, it should be -e^{iπ/5}/5. Are these equal? 

Let me check:

e^{-i4π/5} = e^{-i(4π/5)} = cos(4π/5) - i sin(4π/5) = -cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

- e^{iπ/5} = -cos(π/5) - i sin(π/5)

Yes! Therefore, they are equal. So the residue at α_0 is indeed -e^{iπ/5}/5 = e^{-i4π/5}/5. 

Similarly, for α_1 = e^{i3π/5}, residue is -e^{i3π/5}/5 = e^{-i12π/5}/5 = e^{-i2π/5}/5. 

For α_3 = e^{i7π/5}, residue is -e^{i7π/5}/5 = e^{-i28π/5}/5 = e^{-i3π/5}/5. 

For α_4 = e^{i9π/5}, residue is -e^{i9π/5}/5 = e^{-i36π/5}/5 = e^{-iπ/5}/5. 

Therefore, the sum of residues is:

(-e^{iπ/5} - e^{i3π/5} - e^{iπ} - e^{i7π/5} - e^{i9π/5}) /5

But the sum of these terms is - sum_{k=0}^4 e^{iπ/5 + 2πik/5} = - sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = -0 = 0. 

Therefore, the sum of residues is zero. 

But when I first computed the residues and summed them, I must have made a mistake in the algebra. 

Wait, in the first direct computation, I had:

Sum = [e^{-i4π/5} + e^{-i2π/5} + 1 + e^{-i3π/5} + e^{-iπ/5}]/5

But according to the formula, it should be [ -e^{iπ/5} - e^{i3π/5} - e^{iπ} - e^{i7π/5} - e^{i9π/5} ] /5

But notice that e^{-i4π/5} = -e^{iπ/5}, since e^{-i4π/5} = e^{iπ - iπ/5} = e^{iπ}e^{-iπ/5} = -e^{-iπ/5}. Wait, no:

Wait, e^{-i4π/5} = e^{i(2π - 4π/5)} = e^{i6π/5} = e^{iπ + iπ/5} = -e^{iπ/5}

Similarly, e^{-i2π/5} = e^{i(2π - 2π/5)} = e^{i8π/5} = e^{iπ + i3π/5} = -e^{i3π/5}

e^{-i3π/5} = e^{i(2π - 3π/5)} = e^{i7π/5}

e^{-iπ/5} = e^{i(2π - π/5)} = e^{i9π/5}

Therefore, the sum [e^{-i4π/5} + e^{-i2π/5} + 1 + e^{-i3π/5} + e^{-iπ/5}] = [ -e^{iπ/5} - e^{i3π/5} + 1 + e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5} ]

But e^{i7π/5} = e^{iπ + i2π/5} = -e^{i2π/5}

e^{i9π/5} = e^{i2π - iπ/5} = e^{-iπ/5}

Wait, no:

e^{i7π/5} = e^{i(2π - 3π/5)} = e^{-i3π/5}

Wait, this is getting confusing. Let me write each term:

e^{-i4π/5} = e^{i6π/5} = e^{iπ + iπ/5} = -e^{iπ/5}

e^{-i2π/5} = e^{i8π/5} = e^{iπ + i3π/5} = -e^{i3π/5}

e^{-i3π/5} = e^{i7π/5}

e^{-iπ/5} = e^{i9π/5}

Therefore, the sum becomes:

- e^{iπ/5} - e^{i3π/5} + 1 + e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5}

But e^{i7π/5} = e^{i(7π/5)}, which is the same as α_3 = e^{i7π/5}, and e^{i9π/5} = α_4 = e^{i9π/5}

But sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = α_0 + α_1 + α_2 + α_3 + α_4 = 0. Therefore, the sum is:

- e^{iπ/5} - e^{i3π/5} + 1 + e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5} = - (e^{iπ/5} + e^{i3π/5}) + 1 + (e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5})

But since α_0 + α_1 + α_2 + α_3 + α_4 = 0, then e^{iπ/5} + e^{i3π/5} + (-1) + e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5} = 0. Therefore, e^{iπ/5} + e^{i3π/5} + e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5} = 1. 

Therefore, the sum becomes:

- (e^{iπ/5} + e^{i3π/5}) + 1 + (e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5}) = - (e^{iπ/5} + e^{i3π/5}) + 1 + (e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5})

But since e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5} = e^{iπ/5} + e^{i3π/5} (because they are the conjugates of α_0 and α_1). Wait, no. Wait, e^{i7π/5} = e^{i(2π - 3π/5)} = e^{-i3π/5}, and e^{i9π/5} = e^{-iπ/5}

Wait, no:

Wait, e^{i7π/5} = e^{i(2π - 3π/5)} = e^{-i3π/5}, and e^{i9π/5} = e^{i(2π - π/5)} = e^{-iπ/5}

Therefore, e^{i7π/5} + e^{i9π/5} = e^{-i3π/5} + e^{-iπ/5}

But e^{iπ/5} + e^{i3π/5} = e^{-i3π/5} + e^{-iπ/5} (since they are the conjugates). Wait, no, unless they are real. 

Wait, e^{iπ/5} + e^{i3π/5} is not the same as e^{-i3π/5} + e^{-iπ/5}. 

But in any case, the sum is:

- (e^{iπ/5} + e^{i3π/5}) + 1 + (e^{-i3π/5} + e^{-iπ/5})

But this is a complex number. However, according to the previous equation, the sum of all roots is zero, so the sum of residues must be zero. 

But this is getting too convoluted. The key point is that two different methods give conflicting results. The first method using the residue theorem and properties of roots gives zero, while the direct computation of residues seems to give a non-zero sum. However, upon careful re-examination, the direct computation must have an error because the algebra shows that the sum should be zero. 

Therefore, the mistake in the direct residue computation was likely in the arithmetic when summing the residues. Therefore, trusting the algebraic approach, which is more straightforward, the sum of residues is zero, hence the integral is zero. 

Another way to confirm this is to consider the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) over the contour |z| = 2. If we use the substitution w = 1/z, then as z goes around the circle |z| = 2, w goes around the circle |w| = 1/2. However, this might not help directly. 

Alternatively, consider that the function 1/(z^5 + 1) is a rational function, and for such functions, the integral around a large contour is equal to the sum of residues at the poles. Since we have a large contour |z| = 2, which encloses all poles, and the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero. 

Therefore, after careful consideration and verification, the integral evaluates to zero.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{1}{z^5+1} \\, dz \\) where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, we use the residue theorem. The poles of the function \\( \\frac{1}{z^5 + 1} \\) occur at the roots of \\( z^5 = -1 \\). These roots are the fifth roots of -1, given by \\( z = e^{i\\pi(1 + 2k)/5} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). All these roots lie on the unit circle, so they are inside the contour \\( |z| = 2 \\).

The residue at each simple pole \\( \\alpha \\) (where \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\)) is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{5\\alpha^4} \\). Using the fact that \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\), we find \\( \\alpha^4 = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\). Therefore, the residue at each pole simplifies to \\( -\\frac{\\alpha}{5} \\).

Summing the residues at all five poles, we get:

The sum of the roots of the polynomial \\( z^5 + 1 \\) is zero (by Vieta's formulas), so the sum of the residues is zero. Applying the residue theorem, the integral is:

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around the circle with radius 2 centered at the origin. Hmm, complex integrals... I remember that for contour integrals, the residue theorem is usually the way to go. Let me recall: the residue theorem states that the integral of a function around a closed contour is 2πi times the sum of the residues of the function inside the contour. Right.

First, I need to find the poles of the function 1/(z^5 + 1). The poles occur where the denominator is zero, so solving z^5 + 1 = 0. That equation should give me the roots of unity multiplied by -1. Let me write that down: z^5 = -1. So the solutions are the fifth roots of -1. Since -1 in polar form is e^{iπ}, the roots would be e^{i(π + 2πk)/5} for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. So those are the poles of the function.

Now, I need to check if all these poles are inside the contour |z| = 2. Since the radius of the contour is 2, and all the poles are on the unit circle (since they are roots of z^5 = -1, which has magnitude 1), they are indeed inside the contour. So all five poles are enclosed by the contour.

Next step is to compute the residues at each of these poles. Since each pole is a simple pole (the denominator has derivative 5z^4, which is non-zero at the roots of z^5 +1), I can use the formula for residues at simple poles: Res(f, α) = lim_{z→α} (z - α)f(z). But since the function is 1/(z^5 +1), and z^5 +1 factors as (z - α)(z - α_1)(z - α_2)(z - α_3)(z - α_4), where α, α_1, etc., are the roots, then each residue would be 1/(5α^4), right? Wait, let me verify that.

If I have a function f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1) = 1/( (z - α)(z - α_1)...(z - α_4) ), then near a pole α, the residue is the limit as z approaches α of (z - α)f(z) = 1/( (α - α_1)(α - α_2)(α - α_3)(α - α_4) ). Alternatively, using the derivative of the denominator: since if f(z) = 1/g(z), then Res(f, α) = 1/g’(α). Since g(z) = z^5 +1, g’(z) = 5z^4, so Res(f, α) = 1/(5α^4). That's a simpler way. So each residue is 1/(5α^4).

But since α^5 = -1, then α^4 = α^(-1) * α^5 = α^(-1)*(-1). Wait, maybe I can express α^4 in terms of α. Let me see: α^5 = -1, so α^4 = α^(-1). Wait, because α^5 = -1 implies α^4 = -1 / α. So then, 1/(5α^4) = -α/(5). Because 1/α^4 = -α. Let me check:

If α^5 = -1, then multiplying both sides by α^(-5), we get 1 = -α^(-5). So α^(-5) = -1, which means α^(-1) = -α^4. Wait, maybe I need a different approach. Let me see:

If α^5 = -1, then α^(-5) = -1, so α^(-1) = -α^4. Therefore, 1/(5α^4) = -α/(5). Because 1/α^4 = -α, so multiplying by -1 gives -α. Therefore, the residue at each pole α is -α/(5). So each residue is -α/(5), where α is a root of z^5 = -1.

Therefore, the sum of the residues would be the sum over all roots α of -α/(5). Let me denote the roots as α_0, α_1, α_2, α_3, α_4. Then the sum of residues is (-1/5)(α_0 + α_1 + α_2 + α_3 + α_4). But the sum of the roots of the polynomial z^5 +1 is zero, by Vieta's formula. Wait, the polynomial z^5 +1 can be considered as z^5 + 0z^4 + 0z^3 + 0z^2 + 0z +1. The sum of the roots is -coefficient of z^4 / coefficient of z^5 = 0/1 = 0. Therefore, the sum of the roots α_0 + α_1 + α_2 + α_3 + α_4 = 0. Therefore, the sum of the residues is zero. Therefore, the integral is 2πi times zero, which is zero.

Wait, but that seems too straightforward. Did I make a mistake here?

Let me check again. The residues at each pole are -α/(5). Summing over all five poles, we get (-1/5)(sum of α). But the sum of the roots is zero. Therefore, the sum of residues is zero. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0. Hmm. So the integral is zero?

But let me verify this with another approach. Maybe using the fact that the function 1/(z^5 +1) is a meromorphic function inside the contour, and the sum of residues is zero because the sum of the roots is zero. Alternatively, maybe there's another way to see that the integral is zero.

Alternatively, consider that the function 1/(z^5 +1) can be expressed as 1/(z^5 +1) = 1/(z^5 - (-1)). The residues at the poles sum up to zero because the sum of residues of a rational function where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator minus one is zero. Wait, not sure about that. Alternatively, perhaps using symmetry.

Alternatively, note that the integral around a large circle can sometimes be related to the residues inside, but in this case, the contour is radius 2, which is larger than 1, so all residues are included.

Wait, but maybe there's an error in my residue calculation. Let me verify the residue formula again. For a simple pole at z = α, the residue of f(z) = 1/g(z) is 1/g’(α). Since g(z) = z^5 +1, g’(z) = 5z^4. So Res(f, α) = 1/(5α^4). Then, using the fact that α^5 = -1, so α^4 = α^(-1). Therefore, 1/(5α^4) = 1/(5α^(-1)) = α/5. Wait, hold on! Wait, if α^5 = -1, then α^4 = α^(-1) because α^5 = -1 implies α^4 = -1/α. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous step.

Wait, let's take it step by step. If α^5 = -1, then multiplying both sides by α^(-5), we get 1 = -α^(-5). Therefore, α^(-5) = -1, so α^(-1) = -α^4. Therefore, 1/α^4 = -α. Therefore, 1/(5α^4) = -α/5. So yes, the residue is -α/5. Therefore, summing over all residues gives (-1/5)(sum of α). Since the sum of the roots is zero, the sum of residues is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero.

But let me check with an example. Suppose I have a similar integral, say ∮1/(z^n +1) dz over a large circle. The residues sum up to zero, so the integral is zero. Is that correct?

Wait, but in general, for the integral of 1/(z^n +1) around a large circle, the integral should be zero because the function decays as 1/z^n, so the integral goes to zero as the radius goes to infinity. But in our case, the radius is fixed at 2, but the sum of residues is zero, so the integral is zero. So that seems consistent.

Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy's theorem. If the function is analytic inside the contour except for poles, and the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero. So in this case, since all poles are inside the contour, and their residues sum to zero, the integral is zero.

But let me think again: is there a mistake in assuming the sum of the residues is zero?

Wait, the roots of z^5 +1 are the fifth roots of -1, which are equally spaced around the unit circle. The sum of these roots is zero because the coefficient of z^4 in the polynomial z^5 +1 is zero. So sum of roots is -coefficient of z^4 / coefficient of z^5 = 0. Therefore, the sum of residues is (-1/5)(0) = 0. Therefore, the integral is zero.

Therefore, the answer should be zero. But wait, the original problem had the integral equal to 2/3. Is that a typo? The user wrote ""Evaluate the integral ∮_{|z|=2} 1/(z^5+1) dz where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.\\frac{2}{3}"". So maybe there was a formatting issue, and the actual problem is to evaluate the integral, and the user might have included an incorrect answer. But according to my calculations, the integral is zero.

Wait, but let me check with another method. Let me parametrize the integral. Let z = 2e^{iθ}, so dz = 2i e^{iθ} dθ. Then, the integral becomes ∫0^{2π} 1/( (2e^{iθ})^5 +1 ) * 2i e^{iθ} dθ. Let's write that out:

Integral = ∫0^{2π} [2i e^{iθ}] / [32 e^{i5θ} +1] dθ.

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe not the best approach. Alternatively, consider that for large R, ∮_{|z|=R} 1/(z^5 +1) dz = 2πi * sum of residues inside. But when R is large, the integral can be approximated by ∮_{|z|=R} 1/z^5 dz = 2πi * (residue at 0 of 1/z^5), which is zero because the residue is the coefficient of 1/z term, which is zero. Therefore, as R approaches infinity, the integral approaches zero. But since our radius is 2, which is finite, but the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero. So that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe using power series expansion? Not sure. Alternatively, note that 1/(z^5 +1) can be written as 1/(z^5 +1) = 1/(z^5(1 + 1/z^5)) = 1/z^5 * 1/(1 + 1/z^5). Then, for |z| >1, we can expand 1/(1 + 1/z^5) as a geometric series: sum_{n=0}^infty (-1)^n / z^{5n}. Therefore, 1/(z^5 +1) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n / z^{5n +5}. Then, integrating term by term over |z|=2:

∮_{|z|=2} sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n / z^{5n +5} dz = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n ∮_{|z|=2} 1/z^{5n +5} dz.

Each integral ∮_{|z|=2} 1/z^{k} dz is 2πi if k=1, else zero. So in this case, 5n +5 =1 => n= -4/5, which is not an integer. So all the terms are zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. So that confirms it.

Therefore, the answer is zero. But the user wrote ""Evaluate the integral... \\frac{2}{3}"". Maybe that was a typo or a mistake. But according to my calculations, the integral is zero. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z⁵ + 1) around the circle |z| = 2. Hmm, complex integrals can be tricky, but maybe I can use the residue theorem here. Let me recall, the residue theorem says that the integral around a closed contour is equal to 2πi times the sum of the residues inside the contour. So first, I need to find all the poles of the function inside the circle |z| = 2.

The function is 1/(z⁵ + 1). The poles occur where z⁵ + 1 = 0, so solving z⁵ = -1. The solutions to this equation are the fifth roots of -1. Let me think, the roots of z⁵ = -1 can be expressed using Euler's formula. Since -1 can be written as e^(iπ + 2πik) for integers k, the roots are e^(iπ(1 + 2k)/5) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That gives five distinct roots, each separated by 2π/5 radians.

So the poles are at e^(iπ/5), e^(i3π/5), e^(i5π/5) = e^(iπ) = -1, e^(i7π/5), and e^(i9π/5). Let me check their magnitudes. All these roots lie on the unit circle because for any root z, |z| = |e^(iθ)| = 1. Since the contour is |z| = 2, which is a circle of radius 2, all these poles are inside the contour. Therefore, there are five poles inside the contour, each simple.

Now, to compute the integral using the residue theorem, I need to find the residues at each of these five poles and sum them up. The residue at a simple pole z₀ is given by the limit as z approaches z₀ of (z - z₀)f(z). For a function f(z) = 1/(z⁵ + 1), the derivative of the denominator at z₀ is 5z⁴. So the residue at each pole z₀ is 1/(5z₀⁴).

Let me verify this. If f(z) = 1/(z⁵ + 1), then the residue at a simple pole z₀ is lim_{z→z₀} (z - z₀)/(z⁵ + 1). Since z⁵ + 1 = (z - z₀)g(z) where g(z) = (z⁴ + z³z₀ + z²z₀² + zz₀³ + z₀⁴), then the residue is 1/g(z₀). But the derivative of the denominator at z₀ is 5z₀⁴, so by the formula for simple poles, Res(f, z₀) = 1/(5z₀⁴). Yes, that seems right.

So the residues at each of the five poles are 1/(5z₀⁴). Let's compute each residue individually. Let me denote the poles as α_k = e^(iπ(1 + 2k)/5) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Then, α_k⁵ = e^(iπ(1 + 2k)) = e^(iπ + 2πik) = -1. So α_k⁵ = -1. Therefore, α_k⁴ = α_k⁻¹ / α_k = α_k⁻¹ * α_k⁴? Wait, maybe better to express α_k⁴ in terms of α_k.

Since α_k⁵ = -1, then α_k⁴ = -1/α_k. Therefore, 1/(5α_k⁴) = -α_k/(5). So the residue at each pole is -α_k / 5. Therefore, the sum of residues is -1/5 times the sum of all α_k.

But the sum of all roots of the polynomial z⁵ + 1 = 0 is zero, by Vieta's formula. The polynomial is z⁵ + 1 = 0, so the sum of the roots is zero (since the coefficient of z⁴ is zero). Therefore, the sum of α_k from k=0 to 4 is zero. Therefore, the sum of residues is -1/5 * 0 = 0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi * 0 = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me check again. If all the poles are simple, and their residues sum to zero, then the integral is zero. But is that correct?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the residue calculation. Let me double-check. The residue at z₀ is 1/(5z₀⁴). But since z₀⁵ = -1, then z₀⁴ = -1/z₀. Therefore, 1/(5z₀⁴) = -z₀/(5). So the residue at each pole is -z₀/5. Then, the sum of residues is -1/5 * sum(z₀). But the sum of the roots z₀ of z⁵ + 1 = 0 is zero, so sum(residues) = 0. Hence, integral is zero.

Alternatively, another approach: if I consider the function f(z) = 1/(z⁵ + 1), then the integral around |z|=2 is the same as the integral around any contour enclosing all the poles, which is the same as the integral over the unit circle, but since the poles are all inside |z|=2, but wait, actually, the integral over |z|=2 is the same as the sum of residues inside, which are all the poles. But if the sum of residues is zero, then the integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider that the function f(z) = 1/(z⁵ + 1) can be considered as a rational function, and by the residue theorem, the integral around a large contour enclosing all poles would be zero if the degree of the denominator is higher than the numerator by more than 1. Wait, but here the degree of the denominator is 5, and the numerator is 1, so as |z| approaches infinity, f(z) ~ 1/z⁵, so the integral over a large circle would tend to zero. Therefore, the integral over |z|=2 is equal to the sum of residues inside, which we found to be zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

But wait, let me check with another method. Let's consider parametrizing the integral. But since it's a complex integral, parametrizing might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe using Cauchy's theorem. If the function is analytic inside and on the contour, then the integral is zero. But 1/(z⁵ +1) has poles inside the contour, so it's not analytic there. Therefore, the residue theorem is necessary.

Alternatively, is there a way to see the integral is zero without computing residues? For example, considering that the function 1/(z⁵ +1) has an antiderivative? But I don't think so. The integral is path-dependent unless the function is entire, which it's not.

Alternatively, perhaps using the fact that the sum of residues is zero. Since the function is meromorphic with poles only at the roots of z⁵ +1, and the sum of residues is zero, then the integral over any closed contour not enclosing any poles would be zero. But in this case, the contour does enclose all poles, but since the sum of residues is zero, the integral is zero.

Alternatively, perhaps the function is a rational function where the sum of residues at all poles (including the ones at infinity) is zero. But I need to check. The sum of all residues, including the residue at infinity, must be zero. The residue at infinity is defined as -Res(f, 0) for f(1/z). Let me compute that.

Let w = 1/z, so f(w) = 1/( (1/w)^5 + 1 ) = w^5/(1 + w^5). The residue at w=0 is the coefficient of w^{-1} in the Laurent expansion, but since f(w) = w^5/(1 + w^5) = w^5 * (1 - w^5 + w^{10} - ...) = w^5 - w^{10} + w^{15} - ..., so the residue at w=0 is zero. Therefore, the residue at infinity is -Res(f,0) = 0. Therefore, the sum of all residues (including at infinity) is zero. Since the residues at finite poles sum to zero, the integral over any closed contour is zero. Hence, the answer is zero.

But wait, the user initially put a fraction 2/3, but the correct answer seems to be zero. Maybe there was a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps I made an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let me check once again. The function is 1/(z⁵ +1). The poles are at the fifth roots of -1. The sum of residues is zero, so the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. The initial fraction 2/3 might be a red herring or a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the user wants me to compute the integral using a different method. Let me try another approach. Let's consider expanding 1/(z⁵ +1) in a series. But since |z| = 2, and the poles are at |z|=1, we can write 1/(z⁵ +1) = 1/z⁵ * 1/(1 + 1/z⁵) = 1/z⁵ * (1 - 1/z⁵ + 1/z^{10} - + ... ) for |1/z| < 1, i.e., |z| >1. But on the contour |z|=2, this would converge. Then, integrating term by term:

∫_{|z|=2} 1/z⁵ * (1 - 1/z⁵ + 1/z^{10} - ... ) dz = ∫_{|z|=2} [1/z⁵ - 1/z^{10} + 1/z^{15} - ... ] dz.

Each integral around |z|=2 of 1/z^{n} dz is zero except when n = -1, which corresponds to 1/z. But here, the exponents are 5, 10, 15, which are not -1, so all integrals are zero. Hence, the entire integral is zero. Therefore, this confirms the previous result.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended a different integral or there's a typo. But according to my calculations, the integral is zero.

Wait, but let me check again the residue sum. If each residue is -α_k /5, and the sum of α_k is zero, then sum of residues is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the residues numerically for one pole and check. Let's take a specific pole, say α = e^(iπ/5). Compute the residue there. The residue is -α /5. Let's compute it numerically. Let me compute α = e^(iπ/5) ≈ cos(π/5) + i sin(π/5) ≈ 0.8090 + 0.5878i. Then, residue is -α /5 ≈ -0.1618 - 0.1176i. Similarly, for the other poles, each residue is the negative of the pole divided by 5. If I sum all five residues, let's see:

Sum_{k=0}^4 Res(f, α_k) = Sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k /5 ) = -1/5 Sum_{k=0}^4 α_k.

But the sum of the roots α_k of z⁵ +1 =0 is zero (since the coefficient of z⁴ is zero). Therefore, the sum of residues is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer is zero.

Therefore, despite the user initially suggesting a fraction 2/3, the correct answer is zero. Perhaps the user made a mistake in the problem statement or the fraction was a distractor. But according to the residue theorem and the properties of the function, the integral is zero.

To evaluate the integral \\( \\oint_{|z|=2} \\frac{1}{z^5+1} \\, dz \\) where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin, we use the residue theorem. The poles of the function \\( \\frac{1}{z^5 + 1} \\) occur at the roots of \\( z^5 = -1 \\). These roots are the fifth roots of -1, given by \\( z = e^{i\\pi(1 + 2k)/5} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \\). All these roots lie on the unit circle, so they are inside the contour \\( |z| = 2 \\).

The residue at each simple pole \\( \\alpha \\) (where \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\)) is calculated as \\( \\frac{1}{5\\alpha^4} \\). Using the fact that \\( \\alpha^5 = -1 \\), we find \\( \\alpha^4 = -\\frac{1}{\\alpha} \\). Therefore, the residue at each pole simplifies to \\( -\\frac{\\alpha}{5} \\).

Summing the residues at all five poles, we get:
\\[
\\sum_{k=0}^4 -\\frac{\\alpha_k}{5} = -\\frac{1}{5} \\sum_{k=0}^4 \\alpha_k
\\]
The sum of the roots of the polynomial \\( z^5 + 1 \\) is zero (by Vieta's formulas), so the sum of the residues is zero. Applying the residue theorem, the integral is:
\\[
2\\pi i \\times 0 = 0

Thus, the value of the integral is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).

","Okay, so I need to evaluate the integral of 1/(z^5 + 1) around the circle |z| = 2. Hmm, let's see. I remember that for contour integrals like this, especially when the integrand has poles inside the contour, the residue theorem is the way to go. But first, I need to figure out where the poles of the function 1/(z^5 + 1) are located. 

The poles occur when the denominator is zero, so when z^5 + 1 = 0. Solving that equation, z^5 = -1. So the roots are the fifth roots of -1. Let me recall that the nth roots of a complex number can be found using polar form. Since -1 is e^(iπ), the fifth roots should be e^(iπ + 2πik)/5 for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. That gives us the roots at angles π/5, 3π/5, 5π/5 (which is π), 7π/5, and 9π/5. All these roots lie on the unit circle, right? Wait, but the contour here is a circle of radius 2, which is larger than the unit circle. So all these poles are inside the contour |z| = 2. That means I need to compute the residues at each of these five poles and then sum them up, multiplying by 2πi to get the integral value.

But wait, the problem mentions the answer is 2/3, but I need to check if that's correct. Let me not jump to conclusions. Let me go through the steps carefully.

First, confirm the number of poles. The function 1/(z^5 +1) has poles at the roots of z^5 +1 = 0. As I said, there are five roots, each of order 1 since the derivative of z^5 +1 is 5z^4, which is non-zero at these roots (since z^4 is non-zero except at z=0, but the roots here are not at zero). So all poles are simple.

Now, to compute the residue at each pole. For a simple pole at z = α, the residue is lim_{z→α} (z - α)f(z). In this case, f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1), so the residue at each root α is 1/(5α^4). Because the derivative of the denominator at α is 5α^4, so by the formula, Res(f, α) = 1/(5α^4).

So, if I can compute the sum of 1/(5α^4) for all roots α of z^5 +1 = 0, then multiply by 2πi, that will give me the integral.

Alternatively, maybe there's a smarter way to compute this sum without having to compute each residue individually. Let me think. The roots of z^5 +1 = 0 are the fifth roots of -1. Let's denote them as α_0, α_1, α_2, α_3, α_4. Each α_k = e^(iπ(1 + 2k)/5). So they are spaced every 2π/5 radians starting from π/5.

So, to compute the sum over all residues, which is sum_{k=0}^4 [1/(5α_k^4)]. Let's write that as (1/5) sum_{k=0}^4 (1/α_k^4).

But α_k^4 = e^(i4π(1 + 2k)/5). Therefore, 1/α_k^4 = e^(-i4π(1 + 2k)/5). So the sum becomes (1/5) sum_{k=0}^4 e^(-i4π(1 + 2k)/5).

Let me compute that sum. Let's denote θ_k = -4π(1 + 2k)/5. So the terms are e^{iθ_k}. Let's write out the terms:

For k=0: θ_0 = -4π(1)/5 = -4π/5

k=1: θ_1 = -4π(3)/5 = -12π/5

k=2: θ_2 = -4π(5)/5 = -4π

k=3: θ_3 = -4π(7)/5 = -28π/5

k=4: θ_4 = -4π(9)/5 = -36π/5

But angles are periodic modulo 2π, so let's compute each θ_k modulo 2π:

θ_0 = -4π/5 ≡ -4π/5 + 2π = 6π/5

θ_1 = -12π/5 + 2π = (-12π/5 + 10π/5) = -2π/5

θ_2 = -4π ≡ -4π + 2π = -2π ≡ 0

Wait, but θ_2 is -4π, which is equivalent to 0 modulo 2π? Wait, -4π is equivalent to -4π + 2π*2 = 0. So θ_2 is 0.

θ_3 = -28π/5 + 2π*3 = -28π/5 + 30π/5 = 2π/5

θ_4 = -36π/5 + 2π*4 = -36π/5 + 40π/5 = 4π/5

So the angles for the exponents are 6π/5, -2π/5, 0, 2π/5, 4π/5.

But wait, when converted modulo 2π, the exponents become:

k=0: e^{i6π/5}

k=1: e^{-i2π/5} = e^{i(-2π/5 + 2π)} = e^{i8π/5}

k=2: e^{i0} = 1

k=3: e^{i2π/5}

k=4: e^{i4π/5}

So the sum becomes e^{i6π/5} + e^{i8π/5} + 1 + e^{i2π/5} + e^{i4π/5}

But e^{i6π/5} is the same as e^{i(6π/5 - 2π)} = e^{-i4π/5}

Similarly, e^{i8π/5} is e^{i(8π/5 - 2π)} = e^{-i2π/5}

Wait, maybe there's a pattern here. Let's list the terms:

Term 0: e^{i6π/5} = e^{i(6π/5 - 2π)} = e^{-i4π/5}

Term 1: e^{i8π/5} = e^{i(8π/5 - 2π)} = e^{-i2π/5}

Term 2: 1

Term 3: e^{i2π/5}

Term 4: e^{i4π/5}

So the sum is:

e^{-i4π/5} + e^{-i2π/5} + 1 + e^{i2π/5} + e^{i4π/5}

Now, grouping terms:

1 + [e^{i2π/5} + e^{-i2π/5}] + [e^{i4π/5} + e^{-i4π/5}]

Which is 1 + 2cos(2π/5) + 2cos(4π/5)

Compute those cosines:

cos(2π/5) is a known value, approximately 0.3090

cos(4π/5) is cos(π - π/5) = -cos(π/5) ≈ -0.8090

So 1 + 2*(0.3090) + 2*(-0.8090) = 1 + 0.618 - 1.618 = 1 + 0.618 - 1.618 = 0

Wait, that's interesting. So the sum is 0? Then the total sum over residues is (1/5)*0 = 0, so the integral would be 2πi*0 = 0. But the problem states the answer is 2/3. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, maybe my approach is wrong. Let me check again.

Wait, the residues sum to (1/5) times the sum of 1/α_k^4. But maybe instead of converting to exponents, there's another way to compute the sum.

Alternatively, since the roots are α_k, which are the fifth roots of -1, perhaps there's a way to relate their powers. Let's note that α_k^5 = -1 for each root. Therefore, α_k^4 = -α_k^{-1}. Because α_k^5 = -1, so α_k^4 = α_k^5 / α_k = -1 / α_k. Therefore, 1/α_k^4 = -α_k.

Therefore, the sum over 1/α_k^4 is equal to the sum over -α_k. So sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k) = -sum_{k=0}^4 α_k.

But the sum of the roots of the equation z^5 +1 =0 is zero, because for a polynomial z^n + a_{n-1}z^{n-1} + ... + a_0, the sum of the roots is -a_{n-1}. In this case, the polynomial is z^5 +1, so a_4 = 0, so the sum of the roots is -0 = 0. Therefore, sum_{k=0}^4 α_k = 0. Hence, sum_{k=0}^4 (-α_k) = -0 = 0. Therefore, the sum over 1/α_k^4 is zero. Therefore, the sum of residues is (1/5)*0 = 0, so the integral is zero. But the problem says the answer is 2/3. That's conflicting.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the residue calculation. Let me check again. The residue at a simple pole z=α is lim_{z→α} (z - α)/(z^5 +1). Since z^5 +1 factors as (z - α)(z - β)...(z - ω) where α, β, γ, δ, ω are the roots. Therefore, the residue is 1/(5α^4). Wait, but maybe I should compute it more carefully.

Let me consider f(z) = 1/(z^5 +1). Then, near a root α, we can write z^5 +1 = (z - α)g(z), where g(z) is analytic and non-zero at z=α. Then, the Laurent expansion of f(z) around α is 1/(z - α) * 1/g(α). Therefore, the residue is 1/g(α). But g(z) = (z^5 +1)/(z - α) = derivative of z^5 +1 at z=α, which is 5α^4. Therefore, g(α) = 5α^4, so residue is 1/(5α^4). That seems correct.

But then, sum over residues is (1/5) sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4. But we found that sum is zero, so integral is zero. But the problem states the answer is 2/3. There's a contradiction here. Therefore, perhaps my approach is wrong.

Wait, maybe I need to use a different method. Let me consider the integral over the circle |z|=2. Since the function is 1/(z^5 +1), and the poles are inside the contour, but perhaps there's another way to compute the integral. For example, using the substitution z = 2e^{iθ} and converting to a real integral, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe using the residue theorem is correct, but perhaps I made a mistake in calculating the residues.

Wait, let me check again. Let's take a specific root, say α = e^{iπ/5}. Then, 1/α^4 = e^{-i4π/5}, which is -e^{iπ/5} (since e^{-i4π/5} = e^{i(2π -4π/5)} = e^{i6π/5} = e^{i(π + π/5)} = -e^{iπ/5}). Wait, but according to the previous step, 1/α^4 = -α. So 1/α^4 = -α. Then, sum over all 1/α^4 = -sum over α. Sum over α is zero, so sum over 1/α^4 = 0. Therefore, the residues sum to zero. Hence, the integral is zero. But the problem says 2/3. So maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement? Or perhaps I made an error in my reasoning.

Wait, let me check the problem again. The integral is ∮_{|z|=2} 1/(z^5 +1) dz. The answer is given as 2/3. But according to residue theorem, the answer should be zero. Hmm.

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in assuming all poles are inside the contour. Let's check the modulus of the roots. The roots are fifth roots of -1, so they lie on the unit circle, so |α_k| =1 for all k. Therefore, all poles are inside the contour |z|=2. Therefore, residue theorem applies, and the integral is 2πi*(sum of residues), which we calculated as zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero, but the problem says 2/3. That's confusing.

Wait, maybe there's another approach. Let me consider the integral over a large circle. For |z| large, 1/(z^5 +1) ≈ 1/z^5, so the integral over |z|=2 should be the same as the integral over |z|=R for R approaching infinity, which would be zero because the integral over a large circle of 1/z^5 is zero. But that's not necessarily the case here. Wait, but in our case, the integral is not zero, but according to residue theorem, it is zero. So why is the problem stating the answer is 2/3? Maybe there's a mistake in the problem.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for something else, like the real integral or something, but it's written as a complex contour integral. Wait, maybe I misread the problem. Let me check again: ""Evaluate the integral ∮_{|z|=2} 1/(z^5 +1) dz where the contour is a circle of radius 2 centered at the origin."" The answer is given as 2/3. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe there's a typo, and the integrand is different? For example, maybe it's 1/(z^5 -1) instead of 1/(z^5 +1). Let me check. If the denominator is z^5 -1, then the poles are the fifth roots of 1, which are on the unit circle. Then, using the same reasoning, the residues would sum to something else. But even then, the sum of residues would need to be calculated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and I made a mistake in my residue calculation. Let me try a different approach. Let's consider the function 1/(z^5 +1). Let me parametrize the contour |z|=2 as z = 2e^{iθ}, θ from 0 to 2π. Then, the integral becomes ∫0^{2π} [1/( (2e^{iθ})^5 +1 ) ] * 2i e^{iθ} dθ. That seems complicated to compute directly, but maybe we can use the residue theorem properly.

Wait, but according to the residue theorem, if the function is analytic inside the contour except for poles, then the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues. Since we found all residues sum to zero, the integral should be zero. Therefore, the answer is zero. But the problem says 2/3. Maybe there's a mistake in the problem statement.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the integral of 1/(z^5 +1) along the real axis from -2 to 2, but that's not the case here. The problem specifies a contour integral around |z|=2. 

Wait, unless the problem has a typo and the integrand is 1/(z^5 -1) or something else. Let me check with the given answer. If the answer is 2/3, then maybe the integral is not zero. Let me try to compute the residues again.

Wait, let's compute the residue at each pole α_k. For each α_k, Res(f, α_k) = 1/(5α_k^4). Let's compute the sum over all residues:

Sum = (1/5) sum_{k=0}^4 1/α_k^4

But earlier, we found that 1/α_k^4 = -α_k, so sum = (1/5)(-sum α_k) = (1/5)(-0) = 0. Hence, the integral is zero. Therefore, the answer should be zero. But the problem states 2/3. Therefore, either the problem is incorrect, or I made a mistake.

Wait, perhaps there's an error in assuming all poles are simple. Let me check the order of the poles. The denominator is z^5 +1. The derivative at each root is 5z^4. Since the roots are not at zero, z^4 is not zero, so each pole is simple. Therefore, residues are correctly calculated as 1/(5α_k^4). Therefore, the sum is zero. Therefore, the integral is zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is in the application of the residue theorem. Wait, the residue theorem says that the integral is 2πi times the sum of residues. If the sum is zero, the integral is zero. Therefore, unless there's a mistake in the residue calculation, the integral should be zero. Therefore, I think the problem's answer is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps there's a different interpretation.

Wait, another thought: maybe the problem is asking for the integral of 1/(z^5 +1) over the real line from -2 to 2, which is different from the contour integral. But the problem specifies the contour |z|=2, so that should be a closed contour in the complex plane.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in the problem's given answer. Let me cross-verify with an alternative approach. Let's consider expanding the integrand in a series. For |z|=2, |z^5| = 32, so |z^5 +1| ≥ |32 -1| =31, so the integrand is analytic inside |z|=2? Wait, no, the poles are still inside |z|=2. So the integrand is not analytic inside the contour, so residue theorem applies.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is expecting to use the residue theorem but in a different way. Wait, let me compute the residues numerically for one pole and see if they sum to zero.

Take α = e^{iπ/5}. Compute 1/(5α^4). Let's compute α^4: α = e^{iπ/5}, so α^4 = e^{i4π/5}. Then 1/α^4 = e^{-i4π/5}. Therefore, residue is e^{-i4π/5}/5. Similarly, for α = e^{i3π/5}, residue is e^{-i12π/5}/5 = e^{-i2π/5}/5. For α = e^{iπ}, residue is e^{-i4π}/5 = e^{0}/5 = 1/5. For α = e^{i7π/5}, residue is e^{-i28π/5}/5 = e^{-i28π/5 + 6π}/5 = e^{i2π/5}/5. For α = e^{i9π/5}, residue is e^{-i36π/5}/5 = e^{-i36π/5 + 8π}/5 = e^{-i(-4π/5)} = e^{i4π/5}/5. Wait, but this seems similar to before.

So residues are:

1. e^{-i4π/5}/5

2. e^{-i2π/5}/5

3. 1/5

4. e^{i2π/5}/5

5. e^{i4π/5}/5

Adding these up:

[e^{-i4π/5} + e^{-i2π/5} + 1 + e^{i2π/5} + e^{i4π/5}]/5

Which is the same as:

[1 + e^{i2π/5} + e^{i4π/5} + e^{-i2π/5} + e^{-i4π/5}]/5

Which is:

[1 + 2cos(2π/5) + 2cos(4π/5)] /5

Compute the cosine terms:

cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090

cos(4π/5) = -cos(π/5) ≈ -0.8090

Therefore:

1 + 2*(0.3090) + 2*(-0.8090) = 1 + 0.618 - 1.618 = 0

Therefore, the sum is 0/5 = 0. Therefore, the integral is 2πi*0 = 0. Therefore, the answer should be zero. The problem states the answer is 2/3, which must be incorrect. Therefore, either there's a mistake in the problem statement, or I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about the integral of 1/(z^5 +1), but of something else. Let me check again. The integral is ∮_{|z|=2} 1/(z^5 +1) dz. The answer is given as 2/3. Maybe it's a different function. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the principal value or something else.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in applying the residue theorem. Let me consider integrating around a different contour or using a different method. For example, consider the function 1/(z^5 +1). Let's use the substitution w = z^5. Then, the integral becomes ∫_{|z|=2} 1/(z^5 +1) dz. Let me set w = z^5, so dz = (1/(5w^{4/5})) dw. Wait, but this substitution might complicate things more.

Alternatively, perhaps integrating over a keyhole contour, but that's more for integrals around branch cuts. Alternatively, integrating using a parametrization, but that seems difficult.

Wait, another idea: consider that 1/(z^5 +1) can be expressed as 1/(z^5 +1) = (1/z^5)/(1 + 1/z^5). For |z|=2, |1/z^5| = 1/32, so 1/(1 + 1/z^5) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n / z^{5n} for |z^5| >1, which is true here. Therefore, 1/(z^5 +1) = sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n / z^{5n +5}. Then, the integral becomes sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n ∮_{|z|=2} 1/z^{5n +5} dz. The integral of 1/z^k around |z|=2 is zero if k ≠ -1, and 2πi if k = -1. But here, 5n +5 = -1 implies n = -1.6, which is not an integer. Therefore, all integrals are zero. Hence, the total integral is zero. Therefore, this confirms the residue theorem result.

Therefore, the answer should be zero. The problem's given answer of 2/3 must be incorrect. Perhaps a typo in the problem. Alternatively, maybe the integrand is different, like 1/(z^5 -1), but even then, the sum of residues would need to be computed. For example, if the integrand is 1/(z^5 -1), the poles are at the fifth roots of 1, and the residues would be 1/(5α_k^4), and the sum would be similar, leading to zero as well.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the integral of z/(z^5 +1) instead of 1/(z^5 +1). Let's check that. If the integrand is z/(z^5 +1), then the residues would be z/(5z^4) = 1/5. Sum over all residues would be (1/5)*5 =1, so integral would be 2πi*1=2πi, which is not 2/3 either.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is missing a differential or something. Alternatively, maybe it's a real integral. Wait, if it's the integral from -2 to 2 of 1/(x^5 +1) dx, but that's not a contour integral. The problem specifies a contour integral around |z|=2, so it's a complex integral.

Therefore, after careful consideration, I believe the correct answer is zero. The problem's stated answer of 2/3 is likely incorrect. Therefore, the integral ∮_{|z|=2} 1/(z^5 +1) dz is zero.

To determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\), we start by analyzing the structure of the tensor product and the quotient.

1. **Tensor Product Analysis**:
   - The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\).
   - Tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) results in a ring that is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). This is because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), converting the coefficients from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q}__p \\).

2. **Quotient Ring Structure**:
   - The ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is considered. Here, \\( X - p \\) is a formal variable minus a constant in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).
   - The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring. This ring can be viewed as a truncated polynomial ring where \\( X - p \\) is a nilpotent element.

3. **Principal Ideal Check**:
   - In the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the maximal ideal is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\). This ideal is principal, and all other ideals are powers of this maximal ideal.
   - For each \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, and hence all ideals are principal.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is also principal.

Thus, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether the ring (Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p)/(X - p)^r is principal for all integers r ≥ 1. Hmm, let me start by recalling some definitions and concepts. 

First, Z_p is the ring of p-adic integers, right? And Q_p is the field of p-adic numbers, which is the fraction field of Z_p. The ring Z_p[[X]] is the ring of formal power series with coefficients in Z_p. Then we're tensoring this with Q_p over Z. Wait, tensor product over Z? So, Z_p[[X]] is already a Z-module, and Q_p is a Z-module as well. So, when we tensor them over Z, we get a Z-module structure on the tensor product. But since Z_p is a Z-algebra, and Q_p is a Q-algebra, maybe there's a better way to think about this tensor product. 

Let me recall that tensoring Z_p[[X]] with Q_p over Z is equivalent to tensoring Z_p[[X]] with Q_p over Z_p, because Q_p is flat over Z. Wait, no, actually, flatness of Q_p over Z would be sufficient. But maybe it's simpler to note that Z_p[[X]] is a Z_p-module, and Q_p is a Z_p-module via the inclusion Z_p ⊂ Q_p. So, perhaps Z_p[[X]] ⊗_{Z_p} Q_p would make sense. But the problem states it's over Z. Maybe that's a different construction. 

Wait, maybe I need to think about the tensor product Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p as a ring. Since Z_p is a Z-algebra, and Q_p is a Z-algebra, the tensor product should be a ring. Let me check. If we have two rings R and S over a common ring T, then R ⊗_T S is a ring. So here, Z_p[[X]] is a Z-algebra, and Q_p is also a Z-algebra, so their tensor product over Z should be a ring. 

But Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p. Let me see. Since Z_p is a Z-module, and Q_p is a Z-module, the tensor product would be a Z-module. However, Z_p[[X]] is already a Z_p-module, and Q_p is a Q_p-module. But maybe there's a better way to think about this. Let me recall that tensoring Z_p[[X]] with Q_p over Z would invert the element p in Z_p, right? Because Q_p is the localization of Z_p at the prime ideal generated by p. So, maybe Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p is isomorphic to Q_p[[X]]. Wait, is that true?

Wait, Z_p[[X]] is a Z_p-module, and Q_p is a Z_p-module. So tensoring over Z_p would be different. But here it's tensoring over Z. So, perhaps we can use the fact that Z_p is flat over Z, so Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p ≅ Z_p[[X]] ⊗_{Z_p} Q_p. Since Q_p is flat over Z_p, this would be isomorphic to Z_p[[X]] ⊗_{Z_p} Q_p, which is Q_p[[X]]. Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

If we have a Z-module M and a Z-module N, then M ⊗_Z N is the same as M ⊗_{Z_p} N if Z_p is a Z-module? No, that's not necessarily true. Maybe I need to think differently. Let me recall that Z_p is the completion of Z at the prime ideal pZ. So, Z_p is a Z-module, and Q_p is the fraction field of Z_p, hence a Q-module. But the tensor product Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p might be a ring over Q. 

Alternatively, perhaps Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p is isomorphic to Q_p[[X]]. Let me see. If we have Z_p[[X]] and Q_p, and we tensor over Z, then Z_p[[X]] is a Z-module, and Q_p is a Z-module. So, the tensor product would be a Z-module, but maybe as a ring, it's Q_p[[X]]. Let me check with some simple case. For example, if we take Z_p[[X]] and tensor with Q_p over Z, does that give Q_p[[X]]?

Wait, Z_p[[X]] is the ring of formal power series with coefficients in Z_p. If we tensor this with Q_p over Z, then each coefficient in Z_p can be multiplied by elements of Q_p. But since Q_p is the field of fractions of Z_p, we can think of Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p as Q_p[[X]]. Let me try to verify this. 

Suppose we have an element in Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p. It can be written as a sum of terms a_i ⊗ q_i, where a_i are in Z_p[[X]] and q_i are in Q_p. Since Q_p is the fraction field of Z_p, each q_i can be written as b_i / p^{n_i} for some b_i in Z_p and integers n_i. Then, a_i ⊗ q_i = a_i ⊗ (b_i / p^{n_i}) = (a_i b_i) / p^{n_i} as an element in Q_p[[X]]. So, this suggests that Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p is indeed isomorphic to Q_p[[X]]. 

Therefore, the ring in question is Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r. So, the problem reduces to determining whether Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r is a principal ring for all r ≥ 1. 

Wait, so now I need to check if the quotient ring Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r is principal. A principal ring is a ring in which every ideal is principal, i.e., generated by a single element. So, is Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r a principal ring? 

First, let's recall that Q_p[[X]] is a principal ideal ring because it's a discrete valuation ring (DVR) in the case of a single variable. But here we are quotienting by the ideal generated by (X - p)^r. The quotient ring Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r is a local ring, since it's a quotient of a local ring by a principal ideal. The maximal ideal of this quotient ring would be the image of the maximal ideal of Q_p[[X]], which is generated by X. But in the quotient, the image of X is X + (X - p)^r. Wait, maybe not exactly. Let me think. 

Alternatively, in Q_p[[X]], the ideal (X - p) is a prime ideal because X - p is irreducible. Then, (X - p)^r is a prime power ideal. The quotient Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r is a local ring with maximal ideal generated by (X - p). Wait, but in the quotient ring, the maximal ideal is the image of (X - p), which is generated by X - p. However, the original maximal ideal of Q_p[[X]] is generated by X, but in the quotient, X is congruent to p modulo (X - p). Wait, maybe not. Let me check.

Let me make a substitution: Let’s set Y = X - p. Then, in the ring Q_p[[X]], Y = X - p, and (X - p)^r is Y^r. Then, the quotient ring becomes Q_p[[X]] / Y^r. But X = Y + p, so Q_p[[X]] is isomorphic to Q_p[[Y]] as a ring, since the substitution Y = X - p is an automorphism of Q_p[[X]]. Therefore, Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r is isomorphic to Q_p[[Y]] / Y^r. 

Now, Q_p[[Y]] / Y^r is a ring where Y is nilpotent, since Y^r = 0. This ring is a local ring with maximal ideal generated by Y. In fact, it's a truncated polynomial ring where Y^r = 0, so every element can be written as a polynomial in Y of degree less than r. 

Now, in such a ring, the ideals are generated by Y^k for k from 0 to r. Each of these ideals is principal, generated by Y^k. But wait, the problem states that the ring is principal if every ideal is principal. But in this case, the ideals are all principal, generated by Y^k. So, is this ring principal? Wait, but the ring Q_p[[Y]] / Y^r is a quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal, and the quotient is a local ring with principal maximal ideal. But is every ideal principal?

In a local ring with principal maximal ideal, every ideal is principal. Because in such a ring, any ideal is contained in the maximal ideal, and since the maximal ideal is principal, any ideal is a power of the maximal ideal. Therefore, in Q_p[[Y]] / Y^r, the ideals are (Y^k) for k = 0, 1, ..., r. But since Y^r = 0, the only ideals are (Y^k) for k from 0 to r. However, when k = 0, the ideal is the entire ring, which is principal. For k ≥ 1, the ideals are (Y^k), which are principal. Therefore, the ring Q_p[[Y]] / Y^r is indeed a principal ideal ring for each r ≥ 1. 

Wait, but hold on, is that correct? Let me check for a specific small r. Let's take r = 1. Then the ring is Q_p[[Y]] / Y^1, which is just Q_p, since Y^1 = 0. Q_p is a field, so it's a principal ideal ring. For r = 2, the ring is Q_p[[Y]] / Y^2. The ideals are (0), (Y), and (Y^2) = (0). Wait, no. Wait, in Q_p[[Y]] / Y^2, the elements are a + bY where a, b ∈ Q_p. The ideals are generated by Y. So, the only non-zero proper ideal is (Y). Similarly, for r = 3, the ideals are (Y), (Y^2), (Y^3) = (0). Wait, but in this case, (Y^2) is an ideal, but is it principal? Yes, it's generated by Y^2. Wait, but actually, in Q_p[[Y]] / Y^r, the ideals are (Y^k) for k = 0, 1, ..., r. But since Y^r = 0, the ideal (Y^r) is zero. So, the ideals are (Y^k) for k = 1, 2, ..., r-1. Wait, no, for r = 2, the ideals are (Y^1) and (Y^2) = (0). So, in general, for each r ≥ 1, the ring Q_p[[Y]] / Y^r has ideals (Y^k) for k = 0, 1, ..., r, but (Y^r) is zero. So, the non-zero proper ideals are (Y^k) for k = 1, 2, ..., r-1. Each of these is principal. Therefore, the ring is principal. 

But wait, the problem states the ring is Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p divided by (X - p)^r. We transformed it to Q_p[[Y]] / Y^r, where Y = X - p. So, if Q_p[[Y]] / Y^r is principal for all r ≥ 1, then the original ring is also principal. Therefore, the answer should be yes. 

But let me confirm this with another approach. Suppose we consider the ring Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r. Since X - p is a polynomial in X, and we are quotienting by its r-th power. In the ring Q_p[[X]], the element X - p is a prime element because it's irreducible. Therefore, the quotient ring is a local ring with maximal ideal generated by (X - p). But in the quotient ring, the ideal (X - p)^r is nilpotent. However, in the quotient ring, the ideals are generated by (X - p)^k for k = 0, 1, ..., r. Each of these is a principal ideal. Therefore, all ideals are principal. 

Alternatively, maybe there's a way to see this using the structure theorem for modules over a principal ideal ring. But I'm not sure. Let me think of another angle. Suppose we have an ideal I in the quotient ring Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r. Then, I is isomorphic to some ideal in Q_p[[X]] containing (X - p)^r. But any ideal in Q_p[[X]] is principal, so the intersection with the quotient should also be principal. Wait, but not necessarily. For example, if the ideal in Q_p[[X]] is (X - p)^k, then in the quotient it's (X - p)^k / (X - p)^r, which is principal. But what if there's a non-principal ideal in the quotient? 

Wait, but in the quotient ring, every element is a power series in X - p up to degree r - 1. So, the ring is a truncated polynomial ring. In such rings, every ideal is generated by a monomial, which in this case would be (X - p)^k. Therefore, every ideal is principal. 

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the quotient ring is a finite-dimensional Q_p-vector space. For example, when r = 2, the ring is Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^2, which is a 2-dimensional Q_p-vector space. The only ideals in a 2-dimensional local ring (if it's a field, it's trivial, but here it's 2-dimensional) are (0) and the maximal ideal. Wait, but in 2 dimensions, the only ideals are (0) and the maximal ideal. Wait, no, that's not correct. For example, in the ring Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^2, the elements are a + b(X - p) where a, b ∈ Q_p. The maximal ideal is generated by (X - p). Any ideal must be generated by some element. Suppose an ideal contains an element a + b(X - p). If a ≠ 0, then since Q_p is a field, we can multiply by a^{-1} to get 1 + (b/a)(X - p). Then, this element is a unit because 1 is a unit. Therefore, the ideal is the entire ring. If a = 0, then the element is b(X - p), so the ideal is generated by (X - p). Therefore, in the case r = 2, the only ideals are (0) and (X - p). So, principal. 

Similarly, for r = 3, the ring is Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^3. The elements are a + b(X - p) + c(X - p)^2. Any ideal must be generated by some element. Suppose an ideal contains an element a + b(X - p) + c(X - p)^2. If a ≠ 0, then as before, multiplying by a^{-1} gives 1 + (b/a)(X - p) + (c/a)(X - p)^2, which is a unit. So, the ideal is the entire ring. If a = 0, then the element is b(X - p) + c(X - p)^2. If b ≠ 0, then we can factor out (X - p), getting (X - p)(b + c(X - p)). If b + c(X - p) is a unit, then the ideal is generated by (X - p). If b + c(X - p) is not a unit, then it must be a non-unit, but in the quotient ring, the only non-units are multiples of (X - p). So, the ideal would be generated by (X - p) and (X - p)^2. Wait, but is that principal? Let me check. Suppose we have an element b(X - p) + c(X - p)^2. Let's set ε = X - p. Then, the element is ε(b + cε). If b ≠ 0, then we can factor out ε, getting ε*(b + cε). Since the ring is ε-adic, and b ≠ 0, then b + cε is a unit (because b is invertible and cε is nilpotent). Therefore, the element is ε*(a unit), so the ideal is generated by ε. Therefore, even in this case, the ideal is principal. 

Therefore, in general, for any r ≥ 1, the quotient ring Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, and every ideal is principal. Therefore, the ring is principal. 

But wait, let me check with a different perspective. Suppose we have a ring R = Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r. Since R is a quotient of a principal ideal ring (Q_p[[X]] is a DVR, hence principal), is the quotient necessarily principal? Not necessarily. For example, take R = Z[x, y]/(x, y)^2. This is not a principal ideal ring because the ideal (x, y) is not principal. But in our case, the quotient is by a principal ideal. Wait, but in our case, the quotient is by a principal ideal in a principal ideal ring. However, in general, a quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal is not necessarily principal. But in our case, the ring Q_p[[X]] is a principal ideal ring, and we are quotienting by a principal ideal, but the result is still principal. 

Wait, but in the example of Z[[x]] / (x^2), which is isomorphic to Z[x]/(x^2), this is not a principal ideal ring. For instance, in Z[x]/(x^2), the ideal (2, x) is not principal. However, in our case, the ring is over Q_p, which is a field. So, maybe over a field, the quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal is principal. Wait, but Q_p[[X]] is a DVR, which is a principal ideal ring, and we are quotienting by a principal ideal. However, in the case of a DVR, the quotient by a principal ideal is a local ring whose maximal ideal is principal, but does that make it principal? 

Wait, perhaps not. For example, take the ring k[[t]] / t^r, where k is a field. This is a local ring with maximal ideal t. Any ideal in this ring is generated by t^k for some k ≤ r. So, each ideal is principal. Therefore, in this case, the ring is principal. So, over a field, the quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal is principal. 

Therefore, in our case, since Q_p[[X]] is a DVR (principal ideal ring), and we are quotienting by the principal ideal (X - p)^r, the resulting ring is principal. Therefore, the answer should be yes. 

But let me verify with another example. Take r = 1: then the ring is Q_p[[X]] / (X - p), which is Q_p. Q_p is a field, so it's principal. For r = 2: Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^2, which we saw earlier is a 2-dimensional local ring with only the ideal (X - p). So, principal. For r = 3: similarly, the ideals are (X - p), (X - p)^2, etc., all principal. 

Therefore, in general, for any r ≥ 1, the ring Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r is a principal ideal ring. Therefore, the original ring in question is principal. 

But wait, let me check if there's any detail I might have missed. The original ring is Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p divided by (X - p)^r. We transformed this into Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r by considering that Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p is isomorphic to Q_p[[X]]. Is that really correct? 

Let me go back to the tensor product. Z_p[[X]] is the ring of formal power series over Z_p. Q_p is the field of fractions of Z_p. The tensor product Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p can be considered as follows: since Q_p is flat over Z, the tensor product Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p is isomorphic to Z_p[[X]] ⊗_{Z_p} Q_p. Because Q_p is flat over Z_p, and Z_p[[X]] is a Z_p-module. Then, Z_p[[X]] ⊗_{Z_p} Q_p is isomorphic to Q_p[[X]]. Therefore, yes, Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p is isomorphic to Q_p[[X]]. Therefore, the quotient ring is indeed Q_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r, which we have established is principal. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the ring is principal for all integers r ≥ 1.

**Final Answer**
Yes, the ring is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

To determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\), we start by analyzing the structure of the tensor product and the quotient.

1. **Tensor Product Analysis**:
   - The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\).
   - Tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) results in a ring that is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). This is because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), converting the coefficients from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q}__p \\).

2. **Quotient Ring Structure**:
   - The ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is considered. Here, \\( X - p \\) is a formal variable minus a constant in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).
   - The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring. This ring can be viewed as a truncated polynomial ring where \\( X - p \\) is a nilpotent element.

3. **Principal Ideal Check**:
   - In the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the maximal ideal is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\). This ideal is principal, and all other ideals are powers of this maximal ideal.
   - For each \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, and hence all ideals are principal.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is also principal.

Thus, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Hmm, let me start by understanding the components of this ring.

First, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers. Tensoring this with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) should give me a ring of formal power series with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Wait, because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is a subring of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), right? So \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) should be isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Let me check that. 

Since \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-algebra, the tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) should be the same as \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\). But \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is equal to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), turning \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) into \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). So yes, that tensor product is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). 

Therefore, the ring in question is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). So now I need to determine if this quotient ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). A principal ring is one where every ideal is generated by a single element. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a local ring with maximal ideal \\( (X) \\), but here we are quotienting by \\( (X - p)^r \\), the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring.

Wait, in general, if you have a power series ring over a field and you quotient by a power of a linear polynomial, the quotient ring is a local Artinian ring. For example, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X)^r \\) is a ring where each element is a polynomial of degree less than \\( r \\), and the maximal ideal is generated by \\( X \\). But in our case, it's \\( (X - p)^r \\). Let me consider a substitution. Let me set \\( Y = X - p \\). Then \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y)^r \\), right? Because replacing \\( X \\) with \\( Y + p \\) gives a ring isomorphism. So this quotient ring is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r) \\), which is a truncated polynomial ring. 

In this ring, all elements are polynomials in \\( Y \\) of degree less than \\( r \\), and the maximal ideal is \\( (Y) \\). Now, is this ring principal? In the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r) \\), the ideals are all of the form \\( (Y^k) \\) for \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\). So, every ideal is generated by a single element \\( Y^k \\). Therefore, this ring is a principal ideal ring.

But wait, is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r) \\) a principal ideal ring? Let me confirm. Since it's a quotient of a principal ideal ring by an ideal generated by a single element, and in this case, the quotient is again a principal ideal ring. Because in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y] \\), which is a principal ideal ring, the ideal \\( (Y^r) \\) is principal, so the quotient is also principal. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r) \\) is a principal ideal ring.

But the original ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), which is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r) \\). Therefore, this quotient ring is principal. So, regardless of the value of \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring is principal.

Wait, but let me check for \\( r = 1 \\). If \\( r = 1 \\), then the ideal is \\( (X - p) \\), and the quotient ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\). But \\( X - p \\) is a linear term, and in the power series ring, the quotient by a linear term should be a field, right? Because if you have a power series \\( f(X) \\), then modulo \\( X - p \\), \\( f(X) \\) is congruent to \\( f(p) \\). So the quotient ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), which is a field. In a field, every ideal is principal (trivially, since the only ideals are the zero ideal and the whole ring), so that's principal.

For \\( r = 2 \\), the quotient ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2 \\). In this case, the ring consists of elements of the form \\( a + b(X - p) \\), where \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). The maximal ideal is generated by \\( (X - p) \\), and the ring is a local ring with nilpotent maximal ideal. The ideals in this ring are \\( (0) \\) and \\( (X - p) \\), so again, all ideals are principal.

Similarly, for \\( r = 3 \\), the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^3 \\) has elements like \\( a + b(X - p) + c(X - p)^2 \\), with the maximal ideal \\( (X - p) \\). The ideals here would be \\( (0) \\), \\( (X - p) \\), \\( (X - p)^2 \\), and the ring itself. Wait, but in general, in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r) \\), the ideals are \\( (Y^k) \\) for \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\). So each ideal is generated by a single element \\( Y^k \\), hence principal.

Therefore, for any \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r) \\) is a principal ideal ring, as all its ideals are generated by a single element. Therefore, the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

But wait, let me check if there's a case where this might not hold. For example, if the ring wasn't a quotient of a power series ring but something else. However, in our case, after substitution, it's a truncated polynomial ring, which is principal. Another way to think about it: in a local Artinian ring with principal maximal ideal, all ideals are principal. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring with maximal ideal \\( (X - p) \\), which is principal, then all ideals are principal. This is a standard result in commutative algebra: if a local Artinian ring has a principal maximal ideal, then all its ideals are principal.

Yes, so the conclusion is that for any \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring is principal. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

To determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\), we start by analyzing the structure of the tensor product and the quotient.

1. **Tensor Product Analysis**:
   - The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\).
   - Tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) results in a ring that is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). This is because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), converting the coefficients from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q}__p \\).

2. **Quotient Ring Structure**:
   - The ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is considered. Here, \\( X - p \\) is a formal variable minus a constant in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).
   - The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring. This ring can be viewed as a truncated polynomial ring where \\( X - p \\) is a nilpotent element.

3. **Principal Ideal Check**:
   - In the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the maximal ideal is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\). This ideal is principal, and all other ideals are powers of this maximal ideal.
   - For each \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, and hence all ideals are principal.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is also principal.

Thus, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem.

First, I know that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers. Then, we're tensoring this ring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). Tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) should essentially invert the element \\( p \\), right? Because \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the field of fractions of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), so tensoring with it would make all the coefficients in the power series elements of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) should be isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the ring of formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Let me verify that.

Yes, for a commutative ring \\( R \\) and a localization \\( S^{-1}R \\), we have \\( R[[X]] \\otimes_R S^{-1}R \\cong S^{-1}R[[X]] \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the localization of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) at \\( p \\), so \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). That seems right.

So then, the ring in question is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Wait, but \\( X - p \\) is a polynomial in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Let me check if \\( X - p \\) is a prime element in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a discrete valuation ring if we consider \\( X \\) as a variable, but here the base ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), which is a field. Wait, actually, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a power series ring over a field, so it's a local ring with maximal ideal \\( (X) \\). But \\( X - p \\) is a non-zero element. However, \\( X - p \\) is not in the maximal ideal if \\( p \\neq 0 \\), but \\( p \\) is a non-zero element in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Wait, \\( X - p \\) is a polynomial with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), \\( X - p \\) is a non-constant power series. However, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a complete discrete valuation ring with uniformizer \\( X \\), but \\( X - p \\) is different from \\( X \\). Let's see.

But actually, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a power series ring over a field, so it's a regular local ring of dimension 1, and hence a principal ideal domain? Wait, no, a power series ring over a field is a principal ideal domain only if it's a one-dimensional regular local ring. Wait, actually, in dimension 1, regular local rings are principal ideal domains. So \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal domain because it's a one-dimensional regular local ring. Therefore, every ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is principal. Therefore, the quotient \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a quotient of a principal ideal domain by a principal ideal. Hence, the quotient should be a principal ideal ring.

Wait, but is that true? If we take a principal ideal domain and quotient by a principal ideal, is the result a principal ideal ring? Hmm. Let's recall that in a principal ideal domain, every ideal is principal, and the quotient of a principal ideal domain by a principal ideal is a local ring. If the ideal is generated by a single element, then the quotient is a ring where the maximal ideal is the image of that ideal. However, in this case, the ideal \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is principal, generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\). So the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring with maximal ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\). But is this ring principal?

Wait, in a quotient of a principal ideal domain by a principal ideal, is every ideal principal? Let's take an example. Let's take \\( \\mathbb{Q}[X] \\), which is a principal ideal domain. If we quotient by \\( (X) \\), we get \\( \\mathbb{Q} \\), which is a field, so every ideal is principal. If we quotient by \\( (X^2) \\), we get \\( \\mathbb{Q}[X]/(X^2) \\), which is a ring where every element is of the form \\( a + bX \\), with \\( X^2 = 0 \\). The ideals in this ring are generated by \\( X \\) and \\( (X^2) \\), but \\( (X^2) \\) is already zero. So the only ideals are \\( (X) \\) and \\( (0) \\). So in this case, the quotient ring is a principal ideal ring. Similarly, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring where every ideal is principal. Therefore, the ring in question is principal.

But wait, let me check for a specific case. Take \\( r = 1 \\). Then the quotient ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\). Let's see if this is a field. If \\( X - p \\) is irreducible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then the quotient is a field. But \\( X - p \\) is a power series, but in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), \\( X - p \\) is a nonzero element. Wait, but \\( X - p \\) is not a unit. Let me check if \\( X - p \\) is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). If \\( X = p \\), then \\( X - p = 0 \\), so not invertible. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a non-unit, hence the ideal \\( (X - p) \\) is proper. But is \\( X - p \\) a prime element?

Wait, in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the units are the power series with non-zero constant term. So \\( X - p \\) has a constant term \\( -p \\), which is non-zero in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so \\( X - p \\) is a unit? Wait, no! Wait, in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), a power series is a unit if and only if its constant term is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Since \\( -p \\) is not a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) because \\( p \\) is a prime element (i.e., \\( p \\) is not invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\); wait, actually in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), \\( p \\) is an element of positive valuation, but \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, so every non-zero element is invertible. Wait, hold on, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, so \\( p \\) is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So the constant term of \\( X - p \\) is \\( -p \\), which is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Wait, that can't be right. If \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then the ideal \\( (X - p) \\) would be the entire ring, which contradicts the fact that \\( X - p \\) is not a unit. Wait, no, in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the units are the power series with non-zero constant term. Since \\( X - p \\) has a non-zero constant term \\( -p \\), which is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so \\( X - p \\) is indeed a unit. Wait, but that would mean that \\( X - p \\) is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), which would imply that \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), but that's not true. Wait, this seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's recall that in the ring of formal power series \\( R[[X]] \\), a power series \\( f(X) \\) is a unit if and only if \\( f(0) \\) is a unit in \\( R \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, every non-zero element is a unit, so \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Wait, but then \\( X - p \\) is invertible, so \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), which would mean that the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is zero. But that's not possible because \\( X - p \\) is not equal to the entire ring. Wait, this must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, no. If \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then \\( 1/(X - p) \\) is a power series in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Let's compute it. Let me denote \\( Y = X - p \\). Then \\( 1/Y = 1/(X - p) \\). But how can we express \\( 1/(X - p) \\) as a power series in \\( X \\)? Let's note that \\( X = Y + p \\). So \\( 1/Y = 1/(Y + p - p) = 1/Y \\). Wait, maybe I need to use a substitution. Let's set \\( X = Y + p \\), then \\( Y = X - p \\). Then \\( 1/Y = 1/(X - p) \\). But how can we express this as a power series in \\( X \\)?

Wait, perhaps I need to expand \\( 1/(X - p) \\) as a power series in \\( X \\). Let's recall that \\( 1/(X - p) = -1/p \\cdot 1/(1 - X/p) \\). Then, using the geometric series expansion, \\( 1/(1 - X/p) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (X/p)^n \\). Therefore, \\( 1/(X - p) = -1/p \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (X/p)^n = - \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty X^n / p^{n+1} \\). This is indeed a power series in \\( X \\) with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), since \\( p \\) is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( 1/(X - p) \\) is a power series in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), which means that \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( (X - p) \\) is the entire ring, so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is zero. But that can't be correct because \\( X - p \\) is not the zero element. Wait, this must be wrong.

Wait, maybe the mistake is that \\( X - p \\) is a unit only if its constant term is a unit, but in the case of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the constant term of \\( X - p \\) is \\( -p \\), which is a unit because \\( p \\) is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is indeed a unit, so \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), which would imply that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is the zero ring. But that contradicts the fact that \\( X - p \\) is a non-zero element. Therefore, I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, no. Let's take a concrete example. Let me set \\( p = 2 \\) for simplicity. Then \\( X - 2 \\) is a power series in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_2[[X]] \\). The constant term is \\( -2 \\), which is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_2 \\) because \\( 2 \\) is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_2 \\). Therefore, \\( X - 2 \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_2[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( (X - 2) = \\mathbb{Q}_2[[X]] \\), so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_2[[X]]/(X - 2) \\) is zero. But that's not true because \\( X - 2 \\) is a specific element, not the zero element. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is not a ring of formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), but rather over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), but no, the tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Let me confirm this again. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the localization of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) at the prime \\( (p) \\), then \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). So that's correct. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).

But in that case, \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Wait, but then \\( X - p \\) is invertible, so \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), which would mean that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is zero. But that's not possible. There must be a mistake here.

Wait, maybe the confusion arises from the fact that \\( X - p \\) is a power series, but in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), \\( X \\) is a variable, and \\( p \\) is a constant element. So \\( X - p \\) is a non-constant power series. However, the constant term is \\( -p \\), which is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a unit. Wait, but that seems counterintuitive. Let me take a concrete example with \\( p = 2 \\). Let me compute \\( 1/(X - 2) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_2[[X]] \\).

As I did earlier, \\( 1/(X - 2) = -1/2 \\cdot 1/(1 - X/2) \\). Then, \\( 1/(1 - X/2) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (X/2)^n \\), which is a convergent power series in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_2[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( 1/(X - 2) = - \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty X^n / 2^{n+1} \\), which is indeed a power series in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_2[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( X - 2 \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_2[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( (X - 2) = \\mathbb{Q}_2[[X]] \\), so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_2[[X]]/(X - 2) \\) is the zero ring. But that can't be, because \\( X - 2 \\) is a non-zero element. Therefore, there's a contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). But in reality, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series where coefficients are in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), and \\( X \\) is a variable. So, in this ring, \\( X - p \\) is a power series with a non-zero constant term \\( -p \\), which is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so \\( X - p \\) is a unit. Therefore, \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is zero. But that contradicts the fact that \\( X - p \\) is a non-zero element. Wait, unless \\( X - p \\) is the zero element, which it isn't. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps I need to check whether \\( X - p \\) is indeed a unit. Let me recall that in the ring of formal power series \\( R[[X]] \\), a power series \\( f(X) = a_0 + a_1 X + a_2 X^2 + \\dots \\) is a unit if and only if \\( a_0 \\) is a unit in \\( R \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, every non-zero element is a unit. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) has a non-zero constant term \\( -p \\), which is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is the zero ring. But that can't be correct because \\( X - p \\) is a non-zero element of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, maybe the confusion arises from the fact that \\( p \\) is a prime in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), but in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), \\( p \\) is invertible. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is zero. But then, if that's the case, then the original problem's ring would be zero for \\( r = 1 \\), which contradicts the question's premise. Therefore, there must be a mistake in my initial assumption.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), but \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Is that the case? Let me check the original problem again. The problem states \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So the base ring for the tensor product is \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). But \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module, and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module as well. So the tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\).

But \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-flat, right? Because \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a localization of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\). Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). So my initial conclusion is correct. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is the ring in question.

But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then \\( (X - p) \\) is the entire ring, so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is zero. But that contradicts the problem's context. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the confusion is due to the fact that \\( X \\) is a variable, and \\( p \\) is a constant. In the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), \\( X \\) is a formal variable, and \\( p \\) is a constant element. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a non-constant power series, but in this case, \\( X - p \\) is a unit because its constant term is invertible. Therefore, \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so the quotient is zero. But that can't be. Therefore, the problem must be ill-posed, or there's a misunderstanding.

Wait, perhaps the original ring is not \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), but \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). But that would be different. Let me check. If we first quotient \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) by \\( (X - p)^r \\), then tensor with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), the result is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} (\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r) \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is flat over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), this is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). But \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Therefore, regardless of whether we tensor first or quotient first, the result is the same. Therefore, the ring in question is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\).

But then, if \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is also a unit, so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is zero for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). But that's not possible, because the problem asks whether the ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). If the ring is zero, then trivially all ideals are principal (since there are no non-zero ideals). But that seems unlikely.

Therefore, there must be a mistake in my reasoning. Let's try to approach this differently. Maybe the initial assumption that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is incorrect.

Wait, let's recall that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is a ring of formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module. The tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) can be thought of as \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), since \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-module. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). So that should be correct.

Therefore, the problem reduces to determining whether \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is also a unit, so the quotient is zero, which is principal. But if \\( X - p \\) is not a unit, then the quotient is a non-zero ring, and we need to check if it's principal.

But the confusion arises from whether \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Let me check again. In \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the units are the power series with non-zero constant term. The constant term of \\( X - p \\) is \\( -p \\), which is an invertible element in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so \\( X - p \\) is indeed a unit. Therefore, \\( (X - p) \\) is the entire ring, so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is zero. But then, for \\( r = 1 \\), the ring is zero, which is principal. For \\( r > 1 \\), \\( (X - p)^r \\) is also a unit, so the quotient would still be zero. But this seems to suggest that the ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), but it's always zero.

However, this contradicts the problem's implication that the ring is non-zero. Therefore, there must be an error in my reasoning. Let me consider another approach.

Perhaps the mistake is in the assumption that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal domain. Wait, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a power series ring over a field, so it is a discrete valuation ring with uniformizer \\( X \\). Wait, no, a discrete valuation ring has a single maximal ideal generated by a uniformizer. However, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a ring of formal power series over a field, so it is a regular local ring of dimension 1. Therefore, it is a principal ideal domain. Hence, every ideal is principal. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a quotient of a principal ideal domain by a principal ideal, hence it's a principal ideal ring.

But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is also a unit, so the quotient is zero. However, if \\( X - p \\) is not a unit, then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is a non-zero ideal, and the quotient is a local ring with maximal ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\). But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then the quotient is zero, which is principal. Therefore, regardless of whether the ideal is zero or not, the quotient is principal.

But this seems to suggest that the answer is yes, the ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). However, this contradicts the intuition that when we take a quotient of a PID by a principal ideal, the result is a principal ideal ring, even if it's a local ring. For example, consider \\( \\mathbb{Q}[X]/(X^2) \\). This is a ring where every ideal is principal: the only ideals are \\( (X) \\) and \\( (0) \\). Similarly, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) would be a local ring where the maximal ideal is generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\), and hence every ideal is principal.

Wait, but in the case where \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is a unit, so the quotient is zero. But even if the quotient is zero, it's still principal. Therefore, regardless of whether the ring is zero or a non-zero local ring with principal maximal ideal, it's principal.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

But wait, let me check for \\( r = 1 \\). If \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then the quotient is zero. If \\( X - p \\) is not a unit, then the quotient is a local ring with principal maximal ideal. But in our case, \\( X - p \\) is a unit, so the quotient is zero. Therefore, the ring is principal. For \\( r = 2 \\), \\( (X - p)^2 \\) is also a unit, so the quotient is zero again. Therefore, for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the quotient ring is principal (either zero or a local ring with principal maximal ideal). Therefore, the answer is yes.

But why is this the case even though \\( X - p \\) is a unit? Because in that case, the ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, so the quotient is zero, which is principal. If the ideal is not the entire ring, then the quotient is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, hence principal. Therefore, in either case, the ring is principal.

Therefore, the answer is yes, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

To determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\), we start by analyzing the structure of the tensor product and the quotient.

1. **Tensor Product Analysis**:
   - The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\).
   - Tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) results in a ring that is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). This is because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), converting the coefficients from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q}__p \\).

2. **Quotient Ring Structure**:
   - The ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is considered. Here, \\( X - p \\) is a formal variable minus a constant in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).
   - The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring. This ring can be viewed as a truncated polynomial ring where \\( X - p \\) is a nilpotent element.

3. **Principal Ideal Check**:
   - In the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the maximal ideal is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\). This ideal is principal, and all other ideals are powers of this maximal ideal.
   - For each \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, and hence all ideals are principal.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is also principal.

Thus, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Hmm, let me start by recalling some definitions and properties of rings, especially those involving tensor products and ideals.

First, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers. Then, we're tensoring this with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). Tensor products can sometimes be tricky, but in this case, since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module, the tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) should be isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Yes, because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module, and tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) would invert the primes in \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the field of fractions of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) should give \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). So, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the original ring is \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]}{(X - p)^r} \\).

Wait, but is \\( X - p \\) an element of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\)? Yes, because \\( p \\) is an element of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so \\( X - p \\) is a formal power series where the coefficient of \\( X \\) is 1 and the constant term is -p. So, the ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is just the set of all formal power series where the first \\( r - 1 \\) coefficients are zero. That is, \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the ideal of formal power series with zero coefficients up to degree \\( r - 1 \\).

So, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a ring where each element can be represented by a polynomial of degree less than \\( r \\), right? Because any higher terms are in the ideal. So, this quotient ring is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[X]/(X - p)^r \\), the ring of polynomials modulo \\( (X - p)^r \\). Wait, is that correct?

Actually, in the case of formal power series, when we take the quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\), we are effectively truncating the power series at degree \\( r - 1 \\). So, yes, elements are formal power series up to degree \\( r - 1 \\). However, if \\( X - p \\) is not a nilpotent element here, but actually, in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), \\( X - p \\) is a formal power series that is not nilpotent. Wait, \\( (X - p)^r \\) is not zero in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), right? Because even after exponentiation, the coefficients don't become zero unless all coefficients of \\( X - p \\) are zero, which they aren't. So, the quotient ring is a local Artinian ring, since it's a quotient of a formal power series ring by a power of a maximal ideal. Wait, but is \\( X - p \\) a maximal ideal?

In \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the maximal ideals are generated by irreducible elements. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a discrete valuation ring (DVR) with the maximal ideal generated by \\( p \\), but actually, no, that's not right. Wait, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a complete discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal generated by \\( X \\), right? Because the coefficients are in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), which is a field, so the formal power series ring over a field is a DVR with maximal ideal generated by \\( X \\). Wait, but here we have \\( X - p \\). Is \\( X - p \\) a maximal ideal?

Hmm, perhaps I need to think more carefully. Let me consider \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). The maximal ideals in this ring are generated by irreducible elements. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, the formal power series ring over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a DVR with maximal ideal generated by \\( X \\). So, any element \\( X - a \\) where \\( a \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) would be irreducible, hence generating a maximal ideal. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a maximal ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), right?

Wait, but \\( X - p \\) is not in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Wait, \\( p \\) is in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), but \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the field of fractions. So, \\( X - p \\) is indeed in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), since \\( p \\) is an element of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a power series in one variable over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), and it is irreducible. Therefore, \\( (X - p) \\) is a maximal ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the r-th power of a maximal ideal. Therefore, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring, with maximal ideal \\( (X - p)^r \\).

Now, the question is whether this ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). A principal ring is a ring in which every ideal is principal. Since the ring is local and Artinian, all ideals are contained in the maximal ideal, which is \\( (X - p)^r \\). So, the ideals of the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) are the images of the ideals of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) containing \\( (X - p)^r \\).

In a local Artinian ring, if the maximal ideal is principal, then the ring is a principal ring. Wait, is that true? Let me recall. If the maximal ideal is principal, then the ring is a chained ring, but not necessarily a principal ring. For example, consider the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z} \\), which is a local ring with maximal ideal \\( p\\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z} \\), which is principal, but the ring itself is not a principal ring because the ideal \\( p\\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z} \\) is principal, but the ring is not a principal ring in general. Wait, actually, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z} \\), every ideal is principal, since the ring is a chain of ideals: 0, \\( p\\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z} \\), and \\( \\mathbb{Z}/p^2\\mathbb{Z} \\). So, in that case, the ring is principal. Wait, maybe?

Wait, in a local Artinian ring with principal maximal ideal, all ideals are principal. Let me check. Suppose the maximal ideal is \\( \\mathfrak{m} \\), and \\( \\mathfrak{m} = (a) \\). Then, since the ring is Artinian, the length is finite. The ideals are \\( \\mathfrak{m}^k \\) for \\( k \\leq r \\), but if \\( \\mathfrak{m} \\) is principal, then \\( \\mathfrak{m}^k = (a^k) \\). Therefore, all ideals are principal. Therefore, such a ring is a principal ring.

But in our case, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) has maximal ideal \\( (X - p)^r \\), which is principal. Therefore, all ideals in the quotient ring are powers of \\( (X - p) \\), hence principal. Therefore, the ring is principal.

Wait, but let's verify with an example. Take \\( r = 1 \\). Then, the quotient ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\). In this case, the quotient is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), because \\( X - p \\) is a regular element, so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) by evaluating at \\( X = p \\). But \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, hence a principal ring.

For \\( r = 2 \\), the quotient ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2 \\). Let's see. In this case, the maximal ideal is \\( (X - p)^2 \\). The elements of this ring can be represented by polynomials of degree less than 2, i.e., \\( a + b(X - p) \\) where \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). The ideals in this ring would be \\( (X - p) \\) and \\( (X - p)^2 \\). Both are principal. So, indeed, all ideals are principal.

Similarly, for general \\( r \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring with principal maximal ideal, hence all ideals are principal. Therefore, the ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

But wait, let me think again. Is there a case where even though the maximal ideal is principal, some other ideal is not? In a local Artinian ring with principal maximal ideal, all ideals are principal. Let me recall that in such a ring, the ideals are \\( \\mathfrak{m}^k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, ..., r \\), where \\( \\mathfrak{m} \\) is the maximal ideal. Since \\( \\mathfrak{m} \\) is principal, \\( \\mathfrak{m}^k \\) is also principal, generated by \\( a^k \\). Therefore, all ideals are principal. Therefore, the entire ring is principal.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

But wait, let me check another angle. Suppose we represent the quotient ring as \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[\\epsilon]/\\epsilon^r \\), where \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\). Then, in this ring, every element can be written as \\( a + b\\epsilon + c\\epsilon^2 + \\dots + (r-1)\\epsilon^{r-1} \\). The ideals in this ring are \\( ( \\epsilon^k ) \\) for \\( k = 1, 2, ..., r \\). Each of these is principal, generated by \\( \\epsilon^k \\). Therefore, all ideals are principal. Hence, the ring is principal.

Alternatively, in the case of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), which is a field, the ring is a principal ring. For \\( r = 2 \\), the ring is a local Artinian ring with principal maximal ideal, hence all ideals are principal. Therefore, by induction, for any \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, so I need to determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Hmm, let me start by understanding the components here.

First, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series with coefficients in the p-adic integers. Then, we're tensoring this with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\). Tensoring commutes with taking quotients, right? So, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the same as \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), because \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the localization of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) at the prime ideal generated by p. Wait, is that correct? Let me think.

When you tensor \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), you can think of it as inverting the element p in the coefficients. So, the coefficients become fractions with denominators in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), which is equivalent to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) should indeed be isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). That seems right. So, the tensor product here is just \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\).

So, the ring in question is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Now, I need to check if this ring is principal, meaning that every ideal is generated by a single element. Since it's a quotient of a ring of formal power series, which is a local ring, this quotient should also be a local ring. In a local ring, being principal might mean that the ring is a principal ideal ring, where every ideal is principal.

First, let's recall that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal ring because it's a formal power series ring over a field. The ideals are generated by powers of X. However, when we take the quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\), things might change. Let me think about the structure of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\).

In \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the element \\( X - p \\) is a non-zero divisor because if \\( (X - p)g(X) = 0 \\) for some \\( g(X) \\), then \\( g(X) = 0 \\) since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field and hence has no zero divisors in power series. Therefore, \\( (X - p)^r \\) is a prime ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), and the quotient \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring. Wait, is that right?

Wait, in a formal power series ring over a field, the only prime ideals are those generated by powers of X, but here we are quotienting by \\( (X - p)^r \\). However, \\( X - p \\) is not a power of X, so maybe this isn't a prime power? Hmm, actually, since \\( X - p \\) is a non-zero divisor, the quotient \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is an Artinian local ring with maximal ideal \\( (X - p)/(X - p)^r \\). But in this quotient, the maximal ideal is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\), so every element in the quotient can be written as \\( a_0 + a_1 \\epsilon + \\dots + a_{r-1} \\epsilon^{r-1} \\), where \\( a_i \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).

But how does this structure affect whether the ring is principal? In a local Artinian ring, the ideal structure is such that every ideal is a power of the maximal ideal. Since the maximal ideal is principal, generated by \\( \\epsilon \\), then all ideals are \\( \\epsilon^k \\) for \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\). Therefore, in this case, the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a principal ideal ring because every ideal is generated by a single element (specifically, powers of \\( \\epsilon \\)).

Wait, but is that the case here? Let me verify. Suppose we have an ideal I in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Then I is an ideal in the quotient, so it corresponds to an ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) containing \\( (X - p)^r \\). But in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), ideals are generated by single elements because it's a principal ideal ring. Therefore, any ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) containing \\( (X - p)^r \\) must be generated by an element that divides \\( (X - p)^r \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal domain, the ideal is generated by a single element, say \\( f(X) \\), such that \\( f(X) \\) divides \\( (X - p)^r \\). Therefore, \\( f(X) \\) must be of the form \\( (X - p)^k \\) for some \\( k \\leq r \\). Therefore, the corresponding ideal in the quotient is generated by \\( (X - p)^k \\), so every ideal in the quotient is principal. Therefore, the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a principal ideal ring.

But wait, the original question is about the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p/(X - p)^r \\), which we established is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Therefore, if the latter is a principal ideal ring, then the answer is yes, it is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

But let me check this again. Maybe there's a mistake in my reasoning. Let me consider a specific example. Let's take \\( r = 1 \\). Then the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\). In this case, since \\( X - p \\) is a prime element, the quotient is a field, right? Because \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a domain, and \\( X - p \\) is irreducible. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is a field, which is trivially a principal ideal ring.

For \\( r = 2 \\), the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2 \\). The maximal ideal in this ring is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\), and the elements are of the form \\( a + b\\epsilon \\), where \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). The ideals in this ring are \\( (0) \\), \\( (\\epsilon) \\), and the entire ring. So, indeed, every ideal is principal. Similarly, for higher \\( r \\), the ring is a local Artinian ring with principal maximal ideal, so all ideals are powers of the maximal ideal, hence principal.

Therefore, my initial conclusion seems correct. However, let me consider another angle. Suppose someone argues that even though the ring is local with principal maximal ideal, there might be some non-principal ideal. But in Artinian local rings with principal maximal ideal, every ideal is a power of the maximal ideal, hence principal. This is a known result. For example, in a local Artinian ring, if the maximal ideal is principal, then the ring is a chain ring, meaning the ideals are linearly ordered, each being a power of the maximal ideal. Therefore, every ideal is principal.

Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a principal ideal ring for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Thus, the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

But wait, another thought: the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal domain, but when we take the quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\), we get a ring where the ideal structure is such that all ideals are generated by powers of \\( (X - p) \\). Therefore, in the quotient, the ideals are \\( \\epsilon^k \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, ..., r \\), each generated by \\( \\epsilon^k \\). Therefore, every ideal is principal. Therefore, the quotient ring is principal.

Hence, after considering different angles and verifying with examples and known results about Artinian local rings, I can conclude that the given ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

To determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\), we start by analyzing the structure of the tensor product and the quotient.

1. **Tensor Product Analysis**:
   - The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\).
   - Tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) results in a ring that is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). This is because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), converting the coefficients from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q}__p \\).

2. **Quotient Ring Structure**:
   - The ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is considered. Here, \\( X - p \\) is a formal variable minus a constant in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).
   - The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring. This ring can be viewed as a truncated polynomial ring where \\( X - p \\) is a nilpotent element.

3. **Principal Ideal Check**:
   - In the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the maximal ideal is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\). This ideal is principal, and all other ideals are powers of this maximal ideal.
   - For each \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, and hence all ideals are principal.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is also principal.

Thus, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Hmm, let's start by breaking down what each part of this expression means. 

First, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers. Tensoring this with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) should give me a ring that's similar to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), but I need to confirm that. Wait, actually, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), right? Because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), so coefficients that were in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) become coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So, yes, this tensor product is just \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\).

Now, the ring in question is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\). So, I need to check if this quotient ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). A principal ring is one where every ideal is generated by a single element. So, my task is to determine whether every ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\) is principal.

Let me recall that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a power series ring over a field, which is a principal ideal ring. When we take a quotient by an ideal generated by a single element, like \\( (X - p)^r \\), the quotient ring is also a principal ideal ring if the ideal being quotiented is principal. But wait, here we are quotienting by \\( (X - p)^r \\), which is a principal ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), right? Because \\( X - p \\) is a single element. So, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\) should also be a principal ideal ring. But is that true?

Hold on, maybe I'm missing something. The ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is not just a ring of formal power series; it's a complete discrete valuation ring. The quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\) would give me a local Artinian ring. Let me think: in a local Artinian ring, every ideal is principal? Not necessarily. Wait, in a local Artinian ring, the maximal ideal is principal if and only if the ring is a principal ideal ring. But not all local Artinian rings are principal ideal rings. For example, the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[X]/(X^2) \\) is a local Artinian ring, and its ideals are \\( (0) \\), \\( (X) \\), and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[X]/(X^2) \\). Here, all ideals are principal, so it is a principal ideal ring. Similarly, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X^r) \\) is a principal ideal ring because every ideal is generated by \\( X^k \\) for some \\( k \\leq r \\).

But in our case, the ideal is generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\). Let's see. Let's make a substitution. Let \\( Y = X - p \\). Then, the ring becomes \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y + p]] / (Y)^r \\). Wait, but \\( Y + p = X \\), so substituting back, the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\). Alternatively, perhaps I can make a change of variables. Let me consider \\( T = X - p \\). Then, \\( X = T + p \\), so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) becomes \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T + p]] \\), which is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] \\) because \\( p \\) is a constant term. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] / (T)^r \\). 

Ah! So, if we substitute \\( T = X - p \\), then the quotient ring becomes \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] / (T)^r \\), which is the ring of formal power series modulo \\( T^r \\). In this ring, every ideal is generated by \\( T^k \\) for some \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\). For example, the ideal generated by \\( T^k \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] \\) is principal, and when we quotient by \\( T^r \\), the ideals in the quotient are all of the form \\( (T^k) \\) for \\( k \\leq r \\). Therefore, all ideals in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] / (T)^r \\) are principal. 

But wait, is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] / (T)^r \\) a principal ideal ring? Let me confirm. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] \\) is a power series ring over a field, which is a principal ideal ring, and we are quotienting by \\( (T)^r \\), which is a principal ideal. The quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal is again a principal ideal ring? Not necessarily. For example, \\( \\mathbb{Q}[X]/(X^2) \\) is a principal ideal ring because all ideals are \\( (0) \\), \\( (X) \\), and the ring itself. But if you take \\( \\mathbb{Q}[X]/(X^2, X) \\), that's not principal. Wait, no, in this case, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] / (T)^r \\) is a quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal. However, even though \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] \\) is a principal ideal ring, the quotient may not be. Wait, but in the case of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] / (T)^r \\), every ideal is generated by \\( T^k \\) for some \\( k \\leq r \\). Therefore, all ideals are principal. Hence, the ring is a principal ideal ring.

But let me double-check. Suppose \\( R = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] / (T)^r \\). Then, the ideals of \\( R \\) are in correspondence with the ideals of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] \\) containing \\( (T)^r \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] \\) is a principal ideal ring, every ideal is generated by some \\( T^k \\), so the ideals containing \\( (T)^r \\) are those generated by \\( T^k \\) where \\( k \\leq r \\). Therefore, in \\( R \\), the ideals are \\( (T^k) \\) for \\( k \\leq r \\), each of which is principal. Therefore, \\( R \\) is indeed a principal ideal ring.

Therefore, going back, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]] / (T)^r \\), which is a principal ideal ring. Hence, the answer should be yes, the ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

Wait, but let's think again. The original ring is \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Is that really isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\)? Let me check. \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the same as \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the field of fractions of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), we have that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), so coefficients that were in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) become in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, yes, the tensor product is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the quotient ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), which is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[T]]/(T)^r \\), which is a principal ideal ring.

But another way to think about this is to consider the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Let's consider the substitution \\( Y = X - p \\), so \\( X = Y + p \\). Then, the ring becomes \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y + p]]/(Y)^r \\). But \\( Y + p \\) is just \\( X \\), so the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y)^r \\), which is the same as \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]] \\) modulo \\( Y^r \\). In this ring, every element is a polynomial in \\( Y \\) of degree less than \\( r \\). The ideals in this ring are generated by \\( Y^k \\) for \\( k \\leq r \\), so each is principal. Therefore, all ideals are principal, so the ring is principal.

But wait, let me test with a specific example. Let's take \\( r = 1 \\). Then, the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\). This is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), since \\( X - p \\) is a uniformizer, and the quotient by the maximal ideal \\( (X - p) \\) gives the residue field, which is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, hence a principal ideal ring. For \\( r = 2 \\), the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2 \\). In this case, the ideals are \\( (0) \\), \\( (X - p) \\), and \\( (X - p)^2 \\), which are all principal. Similarly, for any \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ideals are \\( (X - p)^k \\) for \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\), each principal. Therefore, the ring is principal.

But let me check another perspective. Suppose we consider the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) as a power series ring, which is a principal ideal ring. Then, quotienting by a principal ideal \\( (X - p)^r \\), the resulting ring is again a principal ideal ring. However, is this always true? Let me recall that in general, the quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal is not necessarily a principal ideal ring. For example, \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X] \\) is a principal ideal ring, but \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(2, X) \\) is not, since it's isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z}/2\\mathbb{Z} \\), which is a field, but if you take \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X) \\), which is \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), which is not a field. Wait, but \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is a principal ideal ring. Hmm. Maybe if the ring is a local ring, then the quotient is also a principal ideal ring? But \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a local ring with maximal ideal \\( (X) \\), but when we quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\), the maximal ideal is \\( (X - p) \\), but we are working over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), which is a field.

Wait, perhaps in this case, since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a power series ring over a field, which is a principal ideal ring. Then, the quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring, and in a local Artinian ring, every ideal is principal if and only if the ring is a principal ideal ring. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y)^r \\), which is a principal ideal ring, as all ideals are generated by \\( Y^k \\), then yes, the ring is principal.

But let me think again. Suppose I take \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Let's consider the elements of this ring. They are formal power series in \\( X \\) with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), where all terms of degree \\( \\geq r \\) are zero. So, each element can be written as \\( a_0 + a_1(X) + \\dots + a_{r-1}(X)^{r-1} \\), where \\( a_i \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). The ring is then isomorphic to the ring of polynomials of degree less than \\( r \\), which is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[X]/(X^r) \\). Wait, is that correct? Because \\( X^r = 0 \\) in this ring, but \\( X - p \\) is being considered. Wait, no, actually, the ideal is generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\), which is not the same as \\( X^r \\). So, the isomorphism I thought of earlier by substituting \\( Y = X - p \\) is better.

If we set \\( Y = X - p \\), then \\( X = Y + p \\), so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y + p]] \\). But since \\( Y \\) is a formal variable, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y + p]] \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]] \\), because \\( p \\) is a constant term. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y)^r \\), which is the ring of polynomials of degree less than \\( r \\), i.e., \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r) \\). But \\( Y^r = 0 \\), so all products \\( Y^k \\) for \\( k \\geq r \\) vanish. In this ring, the ideals are generated by \\( Y^k \\) for \\( k \\leq r \\). For example, the ideal generated by \\( Y^k \\) is all polynomials divisible by \\( Y^k \\). Therefore, every ideal is principal. Hence, the ring is a principal ideal ring.

Therefore, regardless of \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal. Therefore, the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

But wait, let me check with \\( r = 1 \\). Then, the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\). This is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), since \\( X - p \\) is a uniformizer, and quotienting by the maximal ideal gives the residue field, which is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, it's a principal ideal ring. For \\( r = 2 \\), the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2 \\). In this case, the ideals are \\( (0) \\), \\( (X - p) \\), and \\( (X - p)^2 \\), which are all principal. Similarly, for any \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ideals are \\( (X - p)^k \\) for \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\), each generated by a single element. Therefore, the ring is principal.

Another way to think about this is that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal ring, and the quotient by a principal ideal is again a principal ideal ring. But wait, is that always true? Let me recall that in general, the quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal is not necessarily a principal ideal ring. For example, take \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X] \\), which is a principal ideal ring, but \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(2, X) \\) is not a principal ideal ring. However, in our case, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a power series ring over a field, which is a principal ideal ring. When we quotient by a principal ideal \\( (X - p)^r \\), the resulting ring is again a principal ideal ring because the structure is similar to polynomial rings modulo \\( (X)^r \\), which are principal. 

Alternatively, since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a finite-dimensional vector space over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) (when \\( r \\) is finite), but wait, no, it's an infinite-dimensional vector space because \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) itself is a power series ring, which is infinite-dimensional. However, modulo \\( (X - p)^r \\), the ring is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[X]/(X^r) \\), which is a finite-dimensional vector space (if we truncate the power series to degree less than \\( r \\)), but actually, even in that case, the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[X]/(X^r) \\) is not a field unless \\( r = 1 \\), but it is a principal ideal ring because every ideal is generated by \\( X^k \\). 

Wait, but even in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[X]/(X^r) \\), the ideals are \\( (X^k) \\), which are principal. Therefore, regardless of \\( r \\), this ring is a principal ideal ring. Hence, the original ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal. 

Therefore, after all these considerations, I can conclude that the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

Thus, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Hmm, let me start by breaking down the problem step by step. 

First, I know that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers. Then, tensoring this with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) should give me a ring where the coefficients are in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is probably a ring of formal power series with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Let me check that intuition. 

Yes, tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) should indeed result in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is a ring of characteristic p, and tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) would invert the element p, turning it into \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So, the tensor product here is essentially \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). 

Therefore, the ring in question is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Now, the problem is to determine whether this quotient ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). A principal ring is one in which every ideal is generated by a single element. So, I need to check if every ideal in this quotient ring can be generated by a single element, regardless of the value of r.

Let me first recall some properties of formal power series rings. The ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a local ring with unique maximal ideal generated by X. When we take the quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\), we're essentially looking at the ring of formal power series modulo the ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\). 

Wait, but \\( (X - p) \\) is a linear polynomial in X. So, \\( (X - p)^r \\) is a principal ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), right? Because in a formal power series ring over a field, any monic polynomial generates a principal ideal. So, \\( (X - p)^r \\) is a principal ideal. Therefore, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal. 

But does that necessarily make the quotient ring principal? Hmm, not necessarily. For example, consider the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2) \\). This ring has ideals like \\( (X) \\), which is principal, but the ring itself is not a principal ideal ring because, for instance, the ideal \\( (X) \\) is the only non-zero ideal, but in a principal ideal ring, all ideals should be principal. Wait, actually, in this case, \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2) \\) is a principal ideal ring because every ideal is generated by a single element. Wait, is that true? Let me think.

In \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2) \\), the elements are of the form \\( a + bX \\) where a and b are integers. The multiplication is such that \\( X^2 = 0 \\). The ideals in this ring are generated by elements of the form \\( a + bX \\). However, every ideal is principal because if you take any ideal, say generated by two elements \\( a + bX \\) and \\( c + dX \\), then the ideal is generated by the greatest common divisor of a and c, plus some combination of X terms. Wait, maybe this is a principal ideal ring. Let me check an example. Suppose we have two elements \\( a + bX \\) and \\( c + dX \\). Then, their ideal would be generated by \\( \\gcd(a, c) + \\text{(some multiple of X)} \\). Since \\( X \\) is nilpotent, maybe all ideals are principal. So, perhaps \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X^2) \\) is a principal ideal ring. 

But this is a commutative ring with unity. However, in our case, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is also a commutative ring with unity. Let me think about the structure of this ring. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a discrete valuation ring, and we are quotienting by a power of a prime element \\( X - p \\), then \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is an Artinian local ring. 

In Artinian local rings, the set of ideals is finite, and they form a chain of principal ideals. Wait, but are all Artinian local rings principal ideal rings? Not necessarily. For example, the ring \\( \\mathbb{F}_p[[X, Y]]/(X,Y)^2 \\) is a two-dimensional Artinian local ring that is not a principal ideal ring. However, in our case, the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is one-dimensional because it's a quotient of a one-dimensional local ring. Wait, is it? Let me check.

The dimension of a ring is the Krull dimension, which is the length of the longest chain of prime ideals. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a one-dimensional ring, because its only prime ideals are the zero ideal and the maximal ideal. Then, the quotient by a power of the maximal ideal would still be a one-dimensional ring? Wait, but in the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the only prime ideal is the image of the maximal ideal \\( (X - p) \\), right? Because \\( (X - p)^r \\) is a power of a prime. So, the quotient ring is a one-dimensional Artinian local ring. 

But in one-dimensional Artinian local rings, all ideals are principal. Wait, is that true? Let me recall. In a one-dimensional Noetherian local ring, the set of ideals is a chain, so every ideal is principal. But Artinian rings are Noetherian, so in a one-dimensional Artinian local ring, every ideal is principal. Therefore, if \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a one-dimensional Artinian local ring, then it should be a principal ideal ring. 

But wait, the dimension here is one, and Artinian implies that every prime ideal is maximal. So, in such a ring, the ideals are all principal. Therefore, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) should be a principal ideal ring. Therefore, the original ring in question, which is this quotient, is principal for all r ≥ 1. 

But let me verify this step by step. First, confirm that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a one-dimensional Artinian local ring. 

The ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a discrete valuation ring, which is a one-dimensional regular local ring. The maximal ideal is generated by X. However, when we take the quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\), the new maximal ideal is the image of \\( (X - p) \\). Let's see, \\( (X - p) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is generated by a single element. So, the quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\) would have a maximal ideal generated by \\( X - p \\). Therefore, the quotient ring is a local ring with maximal ideal generated by \\( X - p \\), and since \\( (X - p)^r \\) is nilpotent, the ring is Artinian. 

Therefore, since it's a one-dimensional Artinian local ring, all ideals are principal. Hence, the ring is principal. 

Wait, but is there any catch here? Let me think. Suppose we take a different quotient, say \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X^2) \\). Then, the maximal ideal is generated by X, and all ideals are principal. For example, the only ideals are (0), (X), and the ring itself. So, yes, every ideal is principal. Similarly, for \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the ideals would be generated by powers of \\( X - p \\). 

But hold on, in the case of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the ring is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r) \\) via the substitution \\( Y = X - p \\). Because substituting \\( X = Y + p \\), then \\( (X - p)^r = Y^r \\). So, the ring becomes \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^r) \\), which is a truncated polynomial ring. In such a ring, every ideal is generated by a single power of Y. For example, the ideals are \\( (Y^k) \\) for \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\). So, each ideal is principal, generated by \\( Y^k \\). Therefore, the ring is indeed a principal ideal ring. 

Therefore, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all r ≥ 1. Hence, the answer should be yes.

But let me check another perspective. Suppose we take an arbitrary element in the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Any element can be written as a polynomial in X of degree less than r, since \\( (X - p)^r = 0 \\). Let me denote \\( Y = X - p \\), then the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^r) \\). So, elements are of the form \\( a_0 + a_1 Y + \\dots + a_{r-1} Y^{r-1} \\), where \\( a_i \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). 

An ideal in this ring would be generated by some element. For example, if I take an element \\( g = b_0 + b_1 Y + \\dots + b_{r-1} Y^{r-1} \\), then the ideal generated by g is the set of all multiples of g. However, since \\( Y^r = 0 \\), multiplying by g would give terms up to \\( Y^{2r - 1} \\), but since \\( Y^r = 0 \\), all higher powers vanish. Therefore, the ideal generated by g is actually the principal ideal generated by the greatest common divisor of the coefficients of g in some sense. Wait, maybe not exactly, because the coefficients are in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), which is a field. 

Wait, if the coefficients are in a field, then the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^r) \\) is a vector space over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), and any ideal is a subspace. However, since it's a local ring, the only ideals are the principal ideals generated by \\( Y^k \\) for \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\). Therefore, every ideal is principal, generated by the highest power of Y present. 

For example, if an element has a term with \\( Y^{k} \\), then the ideal it generates will be \\( (Y^k) \\). Therefore, every ideal is principal. Therefore, the ring is indeed principal. 

Another approach: consider that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal. In general, the quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal is not necessarily principal, but in this case, since the ring is a valuation ring and the quotient is a local Artinian ring, which is one-dimensional, and in one-dimensional Artinian local rings, all ideals are principal. Therefore, the conclusion holds. 

But just to be thorough, let's take a specific example. Let r = 2. Then, the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2 \\). Let's denote Y = X - p, so the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^2) \\). The elements are \\( a + bY \\), with a, b ∈ \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). The ideals are: 

1. The zero ideal. 
2. The ideal generated by Y, which is (Y). 
3. The entire ring. 

So, indeed, every ideal is principal. For r = 3, the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^3) \\), with elements \\( a + bY + cY^2 \\). The ideals are (Y), (Y^2), and the zero ideal. So, again, all ideals are principal. 

Therefore, regardless of r, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a principal ideal ring. Hence, the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\), which is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), is principal for all r ≥ 1.

**Final Answer**
The ring is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). \\boxed{Yes}

To determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\), we start by analyzing the structure of the tensor product and the quotient.

1. **Tensor Product Analysis**:
   - The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\).
   - Tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) results in a ring that is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). This is because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), converting the coefficients from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q}__p \\).

2. **Quotient Ring Structure**:
   - The ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is considered. Here, \\( X - p \\) is a formal variable minus a constant in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).
   - The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring. This ring can be viewed as a truncated polynomial ring where \\( X - p \\) is a nilpotent element.

3. **Principal Ideal Check**:
   - In the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the maximal ideal is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\). This ideal is principal, and all other ideals are powers of this maximal ideal.
   - For each \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, and hence all ideals are principal.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is also principal.

Thus, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem into smaller parts. 

First, let me recall what these objects are. \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers. Then, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the field of p-adic numbers. When we tensor \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), we get a ring that's essentially \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), right? Because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) would be the ring of formal power series with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). That makes sense because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) localizes the coefficients, turning the p-adic integers into p-adic numbers.

So, the ring in question is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). The question is whether this quotient ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). A principal ring is one where every ideal is generated by a single element. So, I need to check if every ideal in this quotient ring is principal.

Let me think about the structure of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a local ring with maximal ideal \\( (X) \\), but here we are quotienting by the ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\). Wait, \\( X - p \\) is a polynomial in \\( X \\), so \\( (X - p)^r \\) would be an ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\).

But actually, \\( X - p \\) is a linear polynomial, so \\( (X - p)^r \\) is a principal ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\). So, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal. Is the quotient of a principal ideal ring by a principal ideal necessarily principal? Hmm, not necessarily. For example, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X] \\), if you quotient by \\( (X) \\), you get \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), which is principal, but if you take a higher power like \\( (X)^2 \\), then \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X)^2 \\) is not a principal ideal ring. Wait, but \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X)^2 \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\oplus \\mathbb{Z} \\), which is not a principal ideal ring because it has non-principal ideals. So maybe the answer is no?

But wait, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal ring because it's a formal power series ring over a field. The formal power series ring over a field is a principal ideal domain (PID), right? Because every ideal is generated by a single power series. So, if we take a quotient of a PID by a principal ideal, is the quotient ring also a PID? Let's see. In general, the quotient of a PID by a principal ideal is a PID if the ideal is not a zero divisor. Wait, but even in \\( \\mathbb{Q}[X] \\), which is a PID, if you take a quotient by \\( (f) \\), then the quotient is a ring where the ideals correspond to the divisors of f. So, if \\( f \\) is irreducible, the quotient is a field, which is trivially a PID. But if \\( f \\) is reducible, like \\( f = (X - p)^r \\), then the quotient would have ideals corresponding to the divisors of \\( (X - p)^r \\). But in this case, since \\( (X - p)^r \\) is a principal ideal, the quotient ring would be a quotient of a PID by a principal ideal, which is itself a PID. Wait, but in the ring of formal power series, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the ideal \\( (X - p)^r \\) is principal. So, the quotient \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) should also be a principal ideal ring. But is that true?

Wait, no. Wait, in the ring of formal power series, the quotient by a principal ideal generated by a power series is a ring where every ideal is generated by a power series of lower order. Let me think. For example, in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), if we take the ideal \\( (X - p) \\), then the quotient \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), which is a field, hence a PID. Similarly, if we take \\( (X - p)^r \\), then the quotient \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a ring where the elements are equivalence classes of formal power series modulo \\( (X - p)^r \\). So, perhaps this ring is a local ring with maximal ideal generated by \\( (X - p) \\), and all ideals are powers of this maximal ideal. If that's the case, then each ideal is principal, generated by \\( (X - p)^k \\) for \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\). Therefore, the quotient ring would be a chain ring, where every ideal is principal. Hence, the ring would be principal.

But wait, is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) a chain ring? Let me check. In general, the ring \\( k[[X]]/(X^n) \\) for a field k is a local ring with maximal ideal \\( (X) \\), and the ideals are \\( (X)^0 = k[[X]]/(X^n) \\), \\( (X)^1 = (X)/(X^n) \\), ..., \\( (X)^{n-1} = (X^{n-1})/(X^n) \\). Each of these is a principal ideal generated by \\( X^k \\). Similarly, if we have \\( (X - p)^r \\), then the quotient \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) would have ideals generated by \\( (X - p)^k \\) for \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\). Therefore, every ideal is principal, so the ring is principal.

But hold on, in the case of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the generator of the maximal ideal is \\( X - p \\). But in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), \\( X - p \\) is a formal power series. However, when we take the quotient, we can consider \\( X - p \\) as a nilpotent element? Wait, no. \\( X - p \\) is a linear polynomial, so in the quotient ring, \\( X - p \\) is a nilpotent element only if \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Wait, but \\( (X - p)^r \\) is zero in the quotient, so \\( X - p \\) is nilpotent of order r. Therefore, the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a truncated polynomial ring where \\( X - p \\) is nilpotent of order r. But in such a ring, is every ideal principal?

Let me take a specific example. Let's take \\( r = 2 \\). Then the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2 \\). Let me see if every ideal is principal. Suppose we have an element in this ring. Any element can be written as \\( a + b(X - p) \\) where \\( a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). The ideal generated by this element would be \\( (a + b(X - p)) \\). But since \\( (X - p)^2 = 0 \\), the product of any two such elements would be \\( (a + b(X - p))(c + d(X - p)) = ac + (ad + bc)(X - p) \\). So, the ideal generated by \\( a + b(X - p) \\) is just the set of all elements \\( ac + (ad + bc)(X - p) \\). If \\( a \\neq 0 \\), then this ideal is the whole ring, because we can generate 1 by multiplying by \\( a^{-1} \\). If \\( a = 0 \\), then the element is \\( b(X - p) \\), and the ideal is generated by \\( X - p \\). So, in this case, the only proper ideals are \\( (0) \\) and \\( (X - p) \\). Wait, but that's not right. Wait, in the case of \\( r = 2 \\), the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[X]/(X - p)^2 \\). Wait, is that the same as \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2 \\)? Because \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2 \\) is the same as \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[X]/(X - p)^2 \\), since higher powers of \\( X \\) beyond \\( X^1 \\) would be zero in the quotient. Wait, no, actually, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2 \\) is the ring of formal power series modulo \\( (X - p)^2 \\), which includes terms up to \\( X \\), since \\( X^2 \\) is equivalent to \\( 2pX + p^2 \\), but since \\( X - p \\) is nilpotent, maybe not. Wait, maybe there's confusion here.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X)^r \\). Because \\( X - p \\) is a linear polynomial, so replacing \\( X \\) with \\( X + p \\) would give an isomorphism. Let me check. Let \\( Y = X - p \\), then \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y)^r \\), since \\( Y = X - p \\), so \\( X = Y + p \\). Therefore, substituting \\( X = Y + p \\) into \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) gives \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y + p]] \\), but modulo \\( Y^r \\), which is the same as \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^r) \\). Therefore, the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^r) \\), which is a ring where \\( Y \\) is nilpotent of order r. In such a ring, every ideal is principal, generated by \\( Y^k \\) for some \\( k \\leq r \\). Therefore, the ring is a principal ideal ring.

But wait, in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^r) \\), the elements are of the form \\( a_0 + a_1 Y + \\dots + a_{r-1} Y^{r-1} \\). The ideals in this ring are generated by \\( Y^k \\) for \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\). For example, the ideal generated by \\( Y^k \\) consists of all elements \\( a_0 Y^k + a_1 Y^{k+1} + \\dots + a_{r - k -1} Y^{r - 1} \\). So, every ideal is principal. Therefore, if the original ring is isomorphic to this, then it is principal.

But let me verify this with \\( r = 2 \\). If I take an element \\( a + bY \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^2) \\), then the ideal generated by \\( a + bY \\) is \\( (a + bY) = \\{ c(a + bY) \\mid c \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^2) \\} \\). If \\( a \\neq 0 \\), then this ideal is the entire ring because we can multiply by \\( a^{-1} \\). If \\( a = 0 \\), then the ideal is generated by \\( bY \\). So, the only proper ideals are \\( (Y) \\) and \\( (0) \\). Wait, but this seems like a chain ring, where the ideals are ordered by inclusion. So, in this case, every ideal is principal.

Similarly, for higher \\( r \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^r) \\) would have ideals generated by \\( Y^k \\), each of which is principal. Therefore, the original ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is isomorphic to this, so it should be principal.

But wait, the problem states \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Is this ring really isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\)? Let me confirm. The tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) can be computed as follows. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the localization of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) at the prime ideal generated by p, the tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is already a ring over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), and tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) localizes the coefficients. So yes, the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the quotient \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is indeed the ring we are considering.

Given that, and given the isomorphism to the truncated power series ring, which is a principal ideal ring, then the answer should be yes, the ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

Wait a second, but earlier I thought of an example with \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X]/(X)^2 \\), which is not a principal ideal ring. However, in that case, the ring is not a localization and is not of the form \\( k[[X]]/(X)^r \\). The difference here is that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a formal power series ring over a field, which is a PID, and the quotient is a chain ring. In contrast, \\( \\mathbb{Z}[X] \\) is not a PID, and its quotient is not a chain ring.

Therefore, in the case of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), since it's a quotient of a PID by a principal ideal, and the quotient is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, all ideals are principal, hence the ring is principal. Therefore, the answer should be yes.

But let me check another perspective. Suppose we take an arbitrary ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Let \\( I \\) be an ideal in this ring. Then, \\( I \\) corresponds to an ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) containing \\( (X - p)^r \\). Let \\( J \\) be such an ideal. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a PID, \\( J \\) is generated by some power series \\( f(X) \\). Then, \\( I = J/(X - p)^r \\). But since \\( f(X) \\) must divide \\( (X - p)^r \\), \\( f(X) \\) is of the form \\( (X - p)^k \\) for some \\( 0 \\leq k \\leq r \\). Therefore, \\( I \\) is generated by \\( (X - p)^k \\), so it's principal. Hence, every ideal is principal, so the ring is principal.

Therefore, after all this consideration, I think the answer is yes, the ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

**Final Answer**
Yes, the ring is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Thus, the answer is \\boxed{Yes}.

To determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\), we start by analyzing the structure of the tensor product and the quotient.

1. **Tensor Product Analysis**:
   - The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\).
   - Tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) results in a ring that is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). This is because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), converting the coefficients from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q}__p \\).

2. **Quotient Ring Structure**:
   - The ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is considered. Here, \\( X - p \\) is a formal variable minus a constant in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).
   - The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring. This ring can be viewed as a truncated polynomial ring where \\( X - p \\) is a nilpotent element.

3. **Principal Ideal Check**:
   - In the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the maximal ideal is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\). This ideal is principal, and all other ideals are powers of this maximal ideal.
   - For each \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, and hence all ideals are principal.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is also principal.

Thus, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, so I have this problem here: Determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the ring in question is. The expression \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a tensor product of two rings over the integers. \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series in X with coefficients in the p-adic integers, and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the field of p-adic numbers. So, when we tensor these two rings over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), what do we get?

I recall that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is a complete Noetherian local ring, and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field. Tensoring over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) might simplify things. Let me think: \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module, and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module, their tensor product should be a ring. But \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is already a \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-module, and tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) might be equivalent to tensoring over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), because \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a localization of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\).

Wait, is that right? Let me verify. The tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) can be considered as \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module, and the tensor product over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) can be factored through the base ring. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a flat \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-module (because it's a localization of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)), then \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Wait, is that true?

Hold on, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), and tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) would give us formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). But is that the case? Because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is actually \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), yes? Because when you tensor a ring of formal power series over a ring with a field, you get formal power series over that field. For example, \\( R[[X]] \\otimes_R K \\cong K[[X]] \\) if K is a localization of R. So in this case, since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is the field of fractions of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), then \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the original tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Is that correct?

Wait, but \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-module, so when we tensor with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), we have to be careful. Let me check another way. Let's consider that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module, and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module. So the tensor product over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) would be a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module. But \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) can be considered as \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-submodule of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is flat over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), then the tensor product is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). So, yes, the tensor product is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\).

Therefore, the ring in question is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Now, we need to determine whether this ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

A principal ring is a ring in which every ideal is principal. So, we need to check if every ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is generated by a single element.

First, let's recall that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal ring because it's a formal power series ring over a field. Wait, actually, formal power series rings over fields are principal ideal domains (PID)? Wait, no. The ring of formal power series over a field is a discrete valuation ring, which is a PID because it's a Noetherian local ring with a unique prime ideal (the ideal generated by X), and hence it's a PID. Wait, but \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a discrete valuation ring? Let me confirm.

In a discrete valuation ring, there's a unique non-zero prime ideal, which is the maximal ideal. For \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the maximal ideal is generated by X. So, yes, it's a discrete valuation ring, hence a PID. Therefore, every ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is principal. But when we take the quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\), we get a ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). Is this quotient ring still a principal ideal ring?

Wait, the quotient of a PID by a principal ideal is not necessarily a PID. For example, \\( \\mathbb{Z}/(p^n) \\) is not a PID for n > 1, since it's an Artinian ring with multiple prime ideals. Wait, but in this case, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a quotient of a PID by a principal ideal. Let's analyze its structure.

First, note that \\( (X - p) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a prime ideal? Wait, but \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a discrete valuation ring, so it's a local ring with maximal ideal \\( (X) \\). Wait, but \\( X - p \\) is not in \\( (X) \\), because p is a constant term. So, \\( X - p \\) is not in the maximal ideal, hence it's a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Wait, that can't be. Wait, if we are in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then constants are units except for zero. Since p is a non-zero element of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so p is a unit. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a formal power series with non-zero constant term p, which is a unit. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the ideal \\( (X - p) \\) is equal to the entire ring, which is not possible. Wait, that must be wrong.

Wait, hold on. If \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), which would mean that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is the zero ring, which is not the case. Therefore, my previous reasoning is flawed. Where is the mistake?

Ah! Wait, in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the element \\( X - p \\) is not a unit. Wait, but p is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), right? So, \\( X - p \\) is a formal power series with constant term p (a unit) and other terms. Wait, but in formal power series rings, even if the constant term is a unit, the entire element is not necessarily a unit. For example, in \\( \\mathbb{Q}[[X]] \\), \\( X - 1 \\) is not a unit because 1/(X - 1) = 1 + X + X^2 + X^3 + \\dots \\), which converges in the topology of the ring. Wait, but in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the ring is complete with respect to the p-adic topology, so does that affect convergence?

Wait, no, in formal power series rings, the units are exactly the power series with invertible constant terms. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, any non-zero element is a unit, so in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), a unit is a power series with a non-zero constant term. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) has a non-zero constant term p, which is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so the quotient \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is zero for all r ≥ 1. But that can't be the case because the problem is asking whether the ring is principal, implying that it's non-zero. Therefore, I must have made an error in my reasoning.

Wait, this is confusing. Let me check again. In a formal power series ring over a field, the units are exactly the power series with non-zero constant term. So, if we have \\( X - p \\), where p is a non-zero element of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), then the constant term is p, which is invertible in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a unit, so the ideal generated by \\( X - p \\) is the entire ring. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) would be zero. But the problem states \\( (X - p)^r \\), so even if \\( X - p \\) is a unit, \\( (X - p)^r \\) is still the entire ring. Therefore, the quotient is zero. But that contradicts the problem statement, which is asking whether the ring is principal. So, either the problem is incorrectly stated, or my misunderstanding is here.

Wait, perhaps the original ring is not \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), but maybe there's a different interpretation. Let me go back to the original tensor product. The ring is \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Earlier, I thought this was isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), but maybe that's not correct.

Wait, let's consider the tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module, and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module, their tensor product over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\). But \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a flat \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-module, so \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the original tensor product is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the quotient is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\).

But as we saw, \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so the quotient is zero. Therefore, the ring in question is zero for all r ≥ 1. But that can't be right because the problem is asking whether it's principal. Maybe the problem is misstated, or perhaps I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the tensor product is not as straightforward as I thought. Let me think again. The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field. When we tensor over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), we are essentially extending the coefficients from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So, each coefficient in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is tensored with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), which gives \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) should be isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the quotient is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\).

But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then the quotient is zero. Therefore, the ring is trivial, which is a principal ring (since the only ideal is zero and the ring itself, both principal). But that seems trivial, and the problem probably expects a different answer. Maybe I made a mistake in considering \\( X - p \\) as a unit.

Wait, let's think about the element \\( X - p \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). If we write \\( X - p \\), that's equal to \\( X - p \\cdot 1 \\). Since p is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), does that mean \\( X - p \\) is a unit? Wait, in formal power series rings, the units are exactly the power series with non-zero constant terms. So, if the constant term is a unit, then the entire power series is a unit. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) has constant term p, which is a unit, so \\( X - p \\) is indeed a unit. Therefore, \\( (X - p) = \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so the quotient is zero. Therefore, the ring in question is zero for all r ≥ 1, which is principal, but that seems trivial.

But the problem states ""for all integers r ≥ 1"", and if the ring is zero, then it's trivially principal. However, the problem might have a typo, or perhaps I misread it. Let me check again.

Wait, the problem is written as \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\). If that's the case, then my conclusion holds. However, maybe the ideal is generated by \\( (X - p) \\), but in the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), which is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), but perhaps the ideal is not generated by \\( X - p \\) but by some other element? Wait, no, the ideal is generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\). But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, so the quotient is zero.

Alternatively, maybe there's a miscalculation here. Let me verify with a simpler case. Let's take r = 1. Then the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p) \\). If \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then the quotient is zero. But if \\( X - p \\) is not a unit, then the quotient is non-zero. But according to the logic above, it should be a unit.

Wait, perhaps there's confusion in the notation. Is the ideal generated by \\( (X - p) \\) in the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\)? Let me think about the elements. In \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\), \\( X - p \\) is a formal power series with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\). When we tensor with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), we get elements of the form \\( (f(X) \\otimes 1) \\), where \\( f(X) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\), and scalar multiplication by \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, the element \\( (X - p) \\otimes 1 \\) is in the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). But \\( (X - p) \\otimes 1 \\) is not the same as \\( X - p \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Wait, but we thought they were isomorphic. Is this the mistake?

Ah! Here's the problem. The tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is not isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), because the tensor product over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) does not preserve the ring structure in the same way. Wait, actually, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-module, and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-module. So, when we take the tensor product over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), we have to consider how \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) interacts with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).

Wait, perhaps the correct way is to note that \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-module via the inclusion \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\subset \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}_p} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the tensor product over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) is the same as the tensor product over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-algebra. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is the same as the ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\).

But in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), \\( X - p \\) is a unit, so \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, so the quotient is zero. Therefore, the ring in question is zero for all r ≥ 1, which is principal. But this seems too trivial, and perhaps the problem was intended to have a different ideal, such as \\( (X - p) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) before tensoring, but then tensoring would change things.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in my understanding of the tensor product. Let me consider another approach. Let's represent elements of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Any element in this tensor product can be written as a finite sum of \\( f(X) \\otimes q \\), where \\( f(X) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) and \\( q \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Then, multiplying by elements in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) allows us to write elements as \\( f(X) \\otimes q \\), but since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, and \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-algebra, perhaps this tensor product is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\).

Wait, but in reality, when you tensor \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), you get a ring where each coefficient of X is in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So, for example, if we have a power series \\( \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n X^n \\) with \\( a_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), then tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) would give \\( \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (a_n \\otimes 1) X^n \\), but since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-module, we can write \\( a_n \\otimes 1 = 1 \\otimes a_n \\), where \\( a_n \\) is now considered as an element of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, each coefficient is in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so the ring is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\).

Therefore, the quotient ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\). However, as we saw earlier, \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), so the quotient is zero. Therefore, the ring in question is zero, which is trivially principal. Therefore, the answer would be yes, it is principal for all r ≥ 1.

But this seems counterintuitive because typically, when you take a quotient by a principal ideal in a PID, you don't get a principal ring unless the ideal is zero. Wait, but if the ideal is the entire ring, then the quotient is zero, which is a principal ring. So, in this case, since \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, the quotient is zero, which is principal. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem was intended to have a different ideal, such as \\( (X - p) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) before tensoring, but even then, tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) would make \\( (X - p) \\) a principal ideal in the quotient. Alternatively, perhaps the problem is correct, and the answer is that the ring is principal for all r ≥ 1, because it's the zero ring, which is principal.

Alternatively, maybe there's a mistake in assuming that \\( X - p \\) is a unit. Let me check this again. In \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the units are power series with non-zero constant terms. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) has a non-zero constant term (p, which is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\)), so \\( X - p \\) is a unit, hence the ideal it generates is the entire ring. Therefore, the quotient ring is zero, which is principal.

But then, why does the problem ask whether it's principal? Maybe the problem is in a different context, or there's a typo. Alternatively, maybe the ideal is not generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\), but by \\( (X - p) \\) in the original ring before tensoring. Let's check that.

Suppose the ring in question is \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]}{(X - p)^r} \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Then, \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]}{(X - p)^r} \\) is a quotient of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\), and then tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) would give a different result. But in the original problem, the tensor product is with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) after taking the quotient, which we analyzed as zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have the ideal generated by \\( (X - p) \\) in the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), which is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), but since \\( X - p \\) is a unit, the quotient is zero.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is considering the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) as a ring where \\( X - p \\) is not a unit, but that doesn't make sense because p is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so \\( X - p \\) must be a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\).

Given this confusion, perhaps I should approach the problem differently. Let's consider the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) and the ideal \\( (X - p)^r \\). If the ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, so the quotient is zero. However, if the ring is not zero, then it's a principal ideal ring.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is considering the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) as a ring where \\( X - p \\) is not a unit. But in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), \\( X - p \\) is a unit, so this can't be. Therefore, the only conclusion is that the quotient ring is zero, hence principal.

Alternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and the ideal is supposed to be \\( (X - p) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) before tensoring. Let's explore that possibility.

Suppose the ring is \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]}{(X - p)^r} \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Then, \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]}{(X - p)^r} \\) is a quotient of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\), which is a complete Noetherian local ring with maximal ideal \\( (X) \\). The element \\( (X - p)^r \\) is not in \\( (X) \\), so the quotient ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]}{(X - p)^r} \\) is a ring where \\( X \\) is not nilpotent, and then tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) would give a ring that's not necessarily principal.

But this is speculative. Given the problem as stated, the tensor product is over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), and the quotient is by \\( (X - p)^r \\). Based on the analysis, the quotient ring is zero, hence principal.

Alternatively, perhaps there's an error in assuming that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Maybe it's different. Let's try to describe the elements of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Each element can be written as a sum \\( \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (a_n \\otimes q_n) \\), where \\( a_n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) and \\( q_n \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). But since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\)-module, we can write \\( a_n \\otimes q_n = (a_n \\cdot q_n) \\otimes 1 \\). Therefore, the ring is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, the previous analysis holds.

Given all this, the conclusion is that the ring in question is zero for all r ≥ 1, hence it's trivially principal. Therefore, the answer is yes, it is principal for all integers r ≥ 1.

But to be thorough, let me consider another angle. Suppose we don't assume the isomorphism between the tensor product and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Let's consider the ring \\( R = \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Then, R is a ring where each element is a finite sum of \\( f(X) \\otimes q \\), where \\( f(X) \\in \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) and \\( q \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Now, in this ring, the element \\( (X - p) \\otimes 1 \\) is an element of R. Let's see if it's a unit.

To check if \\( (X - p) \\otimes 1 \\) is a unit, we need to find an inverse element. Suppose we have \\( (X - p) \\otimes 1 \\cdot (f(X) \\otimes q) = 1 \\otimes 1 \\). Then, \\( (X - p) f(X) \\otimes q = 1 \\otimes 1 \\). This implies that \\( (X - p) f(X) = 1 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\), and \\( q = 1 \\). But in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\), \\( (X - p) f(X) = 1 \\) would require that \\( f(X) \\) is the inverse of \\( X - p \\), but in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\), \\( X - p \\) is not a unit because its constant term is p, which is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\). Wait, but in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\), units are power series with invertible constant terms. Since p is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), then \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( (X - p) \\) has an inverse in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\), say \\( f(X) \\), such that \\( (X - p) f(X) = 1 \\). Therefore, in the tensor product R, \\( (X - p) \\otimes 1 \\cdot (f(X) \\otimes 1) = 1 \\otimes 1 \\), so \\( (X - p) \\otimes 1 \\) is a unit in R. Therefore, \\( (X - p)^r \\otimes 1 \\) is also a unit, so the ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring R, making the quotient ring zero.

Therefore, the quotient ring is zero, which is principal. Hence, the answer is yes, the ring is principal for all r ≥ 1.

But this seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem is testing the understanding that when you tensor a ring with a field over the integers, certain properties are preserved. In this case, since \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is a PID and \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a field, the tensor product becomes \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), which is also a PID. However, the ideal \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is the entire ring, so the quotient is zero. Hence, the ring is principal.

Alternatively, if the problem had considered \\( (X - p) \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) before tensoring, then the quotient \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) would be a ring of formal power series modulo a principal ideal, and then tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) would give a ring that's not necessarily principal. But according to the problem statement, the tensor product is first taken, then the quotient is taken by \\( (X - p)^r \\).

Given all this, the conclusion is that the ring is principal for all r ≥ 1.

To determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\), we start by analyzing the structure of the tensor product and the quotient.

1. **Tensor Product Analysis**:
   - The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\).
   - Tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) results in a ring that is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). This is because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), converting the coefficients from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q}__p \\).

2. **Quotient Ring Structure**:
   - The ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is considered. Here, \\( X - p \\) is a formal variable minus a constant in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).
   - The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring. This ring can be viewed as a truncated polynomial ring where \\( X - p \\) is a nilpotent element.

3. **Principal Ideal Check**:
   - In the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the maximal ideal is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\). This ideal is principal, and all other ideals are powers of this maximal ideal.
   - For each \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, and hence all ideals are principal.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is also principal.

Thus, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, so I need to figure out if the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\). Hmm, let's start by breaking down the problem. 

First, I know that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series in variable X with coefficients in the p-adic integers \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\). Then, tensoring this with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) should give a ring that's a bit more ""complete"" or maybe even a field? Wait, tensor products can sometimes be tricky. Let me recall that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), right? Because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is flat over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), and tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) would invert p. So maybe \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the ring of formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Let me check that.

Yes, in general, when you tensor a formal power series ring over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), you get the formal power series ring over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). That simplifies things a bit. So the original ring in question is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\).

Now, the question is whether this quotient ring is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\). A principal ring is one where every ideal is generated by a single element. But wait, actually, the definition of a principal ring is that it is a ring in which every ideal is principal. However, sometimes people might refer to a principal ideal ring, but I think the key here is whether this quotient ring is a principal ideal ring. 

Alternatively, maybe the question is whether this ring is a principal ring in the sense that it's a principal ideal ring. Let me confirm the definitions. A principal ideal ring is a ring where every ideal is principal. So the question is asking if for each \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\) is a principal ideal ring. 

First, let's analyze \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). The ring of formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is a local ring with maximal ideal \\( (X) \\). But when we take the quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\), the structure changes. Let me think about the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\).

Wait, actually, \\( X - p \\) is a linear polynomial in X. Since \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) has characteristic zero and is a field, \\( X - p \\) is a irreducible polynomial over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, the ideal \\( (X - p) \\) is maximal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[X] \\), but in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the ring of formal power series, the topology is different. However, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a local ring with maximal ideal \\( (X) \\), but the quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\) might be a different story.

Wait, but \\( X - p \\) is not in the maximal ideal \\( (X) \\), since \\( p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So \\( X - p \\) is a unit plus X, but X is in the maximal ideal. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), right? Because \\( X - p = -p(1 - \\frac{X}{p}) \\), and since \\( \\frac{X}{p} \\) is a formal power series with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), and \\( 1 - \\frac{X}{p} \\) is invertible because the constant term is 1. Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the ideal generated by \\( X - p \\) is the entire ring. Wait, but that can't be right because we are quotienting by \\( (X - p)^r \\), but if \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is also the entire ring, so the quotient would be zero. That can't be the case.

Wait, this seems like a contradiction. Let me check again. If \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then the ideal \\( (X - p) \\) is the entire ring, so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\) would be the zero ring for any r. But that's not possible because the question is asking whether it's principal for all r ≥ 1, implying that it's a non-zero ring. So I must have made a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps I confused \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) with another ring. Let me recall that in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the maximal ideal is \\( (X) \\), not \\( (p) \\). So \\( X \\) is a prime element? Wait, but \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal ring? Or is it?

Wait, \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a local ring because it has a unique maximal ideal \\( (X) \\). But is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) a principal ideal ring? In general, formal power series rings over a field are principal ideal rings. Wait, no, actually, in a formal power series ring over a field, like \\( k[[X]] \\), every ideal is principal, generated by a power of X. So yes, \\( k[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal ring. So \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal ring. But then, if we take a quotient by \\( (X - p)^r \\), which is an ideal in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then the quotient ring should also be a principal ideal ring, because principal ideal rings have the property that their quotients are also principal ideal rings. Wait, is that true?

Wait, actually, the quotient of a principal ideal ring by any ideal is still a principal ideal ring. Because in a principal ideal ring, every ideal is principal, so the quotient ring will have ideals corresponding to the images of the principal ideals, which should still be principal. So if \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a principal ideal ring, then \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\) should also be a principal ideal ring. But earlier I thought that \\( X - p \\) is a unit, which would make the quotient ring zero, but that contradicts this.

Therefore, my mistake must be in thinking that \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Let me verify this again. In \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), the units are the power series with non-zero constant term. So \\( X - p \\) has constant term -p, which is non-zero in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is indeed a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the ideal generated by \\( X - p \\) is the entire ring, so \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\) is the zero ring. But that can't be, since the question is about whether the quotient is principal for all r ≥ 1, which would not make sense if the quotient is zero for r ≥ 1.

Wait, this is a contradiction. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in my reasoning. Let's backtrack.

First, the original ring is \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Is this isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\)? Let me check that again. The tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is equal to \\( (\\mathbb{Z}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p) [[X]] \\), because tensoring a ring with a ring over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) distributes over the ring structure. Since \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), as \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is flat over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), then \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the quotient ring is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\).

But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, so the quotient is zero. But that can't be the case because the question is asking for all r ≥ 1, which would imply that the ring is non-zero. Therefore, there must be a misunderstanding here.

Wait, perhaps the ideal \\( (X - p)^r \\) is not the entire ring? But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then any power of it is also a unit, so the ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, hence the quotient is zero. But this contradicts the problem's premise. Therefore, my initial assumption that \\( X - p \\) is a unit must be wrong.

Wait, let's check if \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). A function in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is a unit if and only if its constant term is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). The constant term of \\( X - p \\) is -p, which is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) because p ≠ 0 in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, \\( X - p \\) is indeed a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, so the quotient ring is zero. But the problem is asking whether this quotient ring is principal for all r ≥ 1. If the quotient is zero, then it's trivially a principal ring (since the only ideal is zero, which is principal). But that seems too trivial, and the problem probably expects a non-zero ring.

Therefore, there must be a mistake in my analysis. Let me check another angle. Maybe the tensor product is not as I thought. Let's consider \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Is this really \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\)?

Wait, perhaps not. Let's recall that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), and tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) would invert the element p. However, in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\), the element p is not invertible, but in the tensor product, it becomes invertible. Therefore, \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts p, converting the formal power series over \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) into those over \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So that part seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the ideal \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is not the entire ring. Wait, but if \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then any power of it is also a unit, so the ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring. Therefore, the quotient ring is zero. But why is the problem asking about this?
Wait, maybe the confusion is arising from the fact that \\( X \\) and \\( p \\) are different elements? Wait, \\( X \\) is a formal variable, and \\( p \\) is a fixed element in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). So \\( X - p \\) is a formal power series with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), where the only non-zero coefficient is the coefficient of X^1, which is 1, and the constant term is -p. Therefore, the constant term is -p, which is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), so \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, so the quotient is zero. But then, the problem is asking whether the quotient ring is principal for all r ≥ 1. If the quotient is zero, then it is principal, but trivially. But maybe the problem is intended for a different interpretation.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in the problem statement. Maybe the ideal is generated by \\( X - p^r \\) instead of \\( (X - p)^r \\). But assuming the problem is stated correctly, perhaps I need to think differently.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the definition of principal rings. A principal ring is one where every ideal is principal. If the ring is the zero ring, then it only has one ideal, which is itself, so it is principal. But the problem might be considering non-zero rings. Alternatively, perhaps the question is whether the ring is a principal ideal ring, meaning that all ideals are principal. If the quotient ring is zero, then it's trivial. But the problem states ""for all integers r ≥ 1"", so even if for r=1 it's zero, but for higher r it's also zero, then it's still principal. But maybe the problem is expecting that the ring is non-zero for some r, but for all r it's principal.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the tensor product. Let me consider the ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Since \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), as \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is flat over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\), then \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the quotient is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\). But as we saw, \\( X - p \\) is a unit, so this quotient is zero. Therefore, the answer would be that yes, the ring is principal for all r ≥ 1, because the only ideal is zero, which is principal. But this seems too trivial.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is not about the quotient ring, but about the ideal itself. Wait, no, the question is whether the ring is principal. So if the ring is zero, it's principal. If the ring is non-zero, then we need to check if all its ideals are principal.

But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, so the quotient is zero. Therefore, for all r ≥ 1, the quotient ring is zero, which is principal. Therefore, the answer is yes. But that seems too straightforward. Maybe the problem is expecting a different approach.

Alternatively, perhaps there's a mistake in assuming that \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Let me verify this again. The tensor product \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is equal to \\( (\\mathbb{Z}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p) [[X]] \\), since the tensor product distributes over the ring structure. And \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), because \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) is a free \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\)-module, and tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) gives \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, the tensor product is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the quotient ring is indeed \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\).

But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, so the quotient is zero. Hence, for all r ≥ 1, the quotient ring is zero, which is principal. Therefore, the answer is yes. But this seems too simple. Maybe the problem is intended to consider the case where \\( X - p \\) is not a unit, but perhaps in a different ring.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the ring structure. Let's consider \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Another way to think about this tensor product is to consider the elements of \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) as formal power series with coefficients in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\), and tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) allows us to multiply coefficients by elements of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\). Therefore, each coefficient in \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) can be scaled by any element of \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\), effectively turning \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) into \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). Therefore, the quotient ring is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\).

But if \\( X - p \\) is a unit in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\), then the quotient is zero. Therefore, the answer is yes, the ring is principal for all r ≥ 1. But let me check for a specific r. Let's take r = 1. Then the quotient is \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p) \\). If \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then the quotient is zero. Similarly, for any r ≥ 1, the quotient is zero, which is trivially principal. Therefore, the answer is yes.

However, this seems counterintuitive because usually, such quotient rings are non-zero and have some structure. Perhaps the confusion arises because \\( X - p \\) is a unit, but in reality, when we take the quotient by a unit ideal, the ring collapses to zero. Therefore, the answer is yes, the ring is principal for all r ≥ 1.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is intended to have \\( X - p^r \\) instead of \\( (X - p)^r \\), but assuming the problem is stated correctly, the answer should be yes. However, to ensure correctness, let me double-check.

Another approach: Let's consider the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] / (X - p)^r \\). Since \\( X - p \\) is a unit, then \\( (X - p)^r \\) is the entire ring, hence the quotient is zero. Therefore, for any r ≥ 1, the ring is zero, which is a principal ring. Therefore, the answer is yes.

But maybe the problem is expecting a different interpretation where \\( X - p \\) is not a unit. For example, if we consider \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) as a ring where \\( X \\) is a prime element, but in this case, \\( X - p \\) is still a unit. Therefore, regardless, the quotient is zero. Hence, the answer is yes.

Therefore, after this long thought process, I conclude that the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is indeed principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\), because it is the zero ring, which is trivially principal.

","Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to determine whether the ring R = (Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p)/(X - p)^r is principal for all integers r ≥ 1. Hmm, principal ring means that every ideal is generated by a single element, right? So, I need to check if every ideal in this ring R is principal for each r. 

First, let me recall some things. Z_p is the ring of p-adic integers, and Q_p is the field of p-adic numbers. The tensor product Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p – I should figure out what this ring looks like. Maybe it's isomorphic to Q_p[[X]]? Because Z_p is a Z-algebra, and tensoring with Q_p would invert the element p, so elements of Z_p[[X]] would become elements of Q_p[[X]] where the coefficients are p-adic integers turned into p-adic numbers. So, yes, Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p is isomorphic to Q_p[[X]]. That makes sense. So R is Q_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r. 

Wait, but is that correct? Let me think again. The tensor product Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p – since Q_p is the fraction field of Z_p, tensoring with Q_p over Z should indeed invert the element p, so all coefficients in the power series become elements of Q_p. So, yes, Z_p[[X]] ⊗_Z Q_p is Q_p[[X]]. So R is Q_p[[X]] modulo the ideal generated by (X - p)^r. 

But wait, (X - p) is a polynomial in X with coefficients in Q_p. However, in Q_p[[X]], X - p is a formal power series, but since it's linear, it's a polynomial. So the ideal generated by (X - p)^r in Q_p[[X]] is the set of all power series in Q_p[[X]] that are multiples of (X - p)^r. Therefore, R is the quotient ring of Q_p[[X]] by the ideal generated by (X - p)^r. 

So, R is a quotient of the formal power series ring over Q_p. Now, I need to check if R is a principal ideal ring. That is, every ideal in R is principal. For this, I need to understand the structure of R. 

First, note that Q_p[[X]] is a principal ideal ring because it's a local ring with a unique maximal ideal generated by X. However, when we quotient by an ideal like (X - p)^r, the structure of the quotient ring depends on the ideal. Let me analyze R = Q_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r. 

Let me denote the ideal as I = (X - p)^r. So elements of R are equivalence classes of power series in Q_p[[X]] modulo I. Each element can be represented as a power series of degree less than r, since any higher degree term is a multiple of (X - p)^r. But wait, is that the case? Because in the quotient ring, two elements are equivalent if their difference is in I. So, the quotient ring R is the set of power series in Q_p[[X]] where we identify two power series if their difference is divisible by (X - p)^r. 

But since (X - p) is a linear polynomial, (X - p)^r is a monic polynomial of degree r. Therefore, in the quotient ring, the image of X is congruent to p modulo I, because X - p ≡ 0 mod I, so X ≡ p mod I. Similarly, X^2 ≡ 2pX - p^2 mod I, and so on. Therefore, in R, the variable X is congruent to p plus higher terms, which when raised to powers, can be expressed as p + higher terms, but since we're modding out by (X - p)^r, the higher terms beyond degree r-1 are identified with zero. 

Therefore, R is isomorphic to the ring Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r, but considered as a quotient of the formal power series ring. However, in the polynomial ring Q_p[X], the quotient Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r is a local ring with maximal ideal generated by (X - p). But in our case, it's a quotient of the formal power series ring. However, since X is congruent to p modulo I, the ring R is isomorphic to Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r, but with X being a variable such that X ≡ p mod I. 

Wait, but in the formal power series ring Q_p[[X]], the quotient by (X - p)^r is not the same as the polynomial ring quotient. However, since (X - p)^r is a monic polynomial, and in the formal power series ring, every element can be written as a polynomial plus a multiple of (X - p)^r. So, in fact, Q_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r is isomorphic to Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r. Because any formal power series in Q_p[[X]] can be written as a polynomial of degree less than r plus a multiple of (X - p)^r. Therefore, the quotient is indeed isomorphic to Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r. 

So R is isomorphic to Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r. Now, Q_p[X] is a polynomial ring over the field Q_p, so Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r is a quotient of a polynomial ring by a principal ideal. Wait, but (X - p) is a linear polynomial, so (X - p)^r is a principal ideal generated by (X - p)^r. Therefore, Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r is a local ring with maximal ideal generated by (X - p). 

But in this quotient ring, is every ideal principal? In a polynomial ring over a field, the quotient by a principal ideal is a local ring. However, in this case, the ring Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r is a local Artinian ring because it's a quotient of a polynomial ring by a power of a maximal ideal. Wait, is it Artinian? Yes, because it's a finite-dimensional vector space over Q_p. Since Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r is a vector space over Q_p with basis {1, X - p, (X - p)^2, ..., (X - p)^{r-1}}, so it's finite-dimensional, hence Artinian. 

In an Artinian ring, every prime ideal is maximal, but not necessarily every ideal is principal. For example, in the ring Q_p[X]/(X - p)^2, the ideals are the zero ideal, the maximal ideal generated by (X - p), and the ring itself. But wait, in Q_p[X]/(X - p)^2, the ideals are: 

- The zero ideal. 
- The ideal generated by (X - p). 
- The entire ring. 

But wait, no, actually in Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r, the ideals are the powers of the maximal ideal. Because the ring is a chain of ideals: (0) ⊂ (X - p) ⊂ (X - p)^2 ⊂ ... ⊂ (X - p)^{r-1} ⊂ (X - p)^r = (0). Wait, but in the quotient ring Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r, the ideals correspond to the ideals in Q_p[X] containing (X - p)^r. So the ideals in Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r are the images of the ideals in Q_p[X] that contain (X - p)^r. 

In Q_p[X], the ideals containing (X - p)^r are of the form (X - p)^k where k ≤ r. Therefore, in the quotient ring Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r, the ideals are the images of these, which are the ideals generated by (X - p)^k for k = 0, 1, ..., r. Wait, but when k = 0, it's the entire ring. So the ideals are (X - p)^k for k from 0 to r. However, in the quotient ring, (X - p)^r is zero, so the ideals in the quotient are the images of (X - p)^k for k from 0 to r. But since (X - p)^r is zero, the ideals in the quotient are (X - p)^k where k from 0 to r. But since (X - p)^r is zero, the ideal (X - p)^k for k ≥ r is just zero. Therefore, in the quotient ring, the ideals are (X - p)^k for k = 0, 1, ..., r. But (X - p)^r is zero, so the ideals are (X - p)^k for k = 0, 1, ..., r-1, and the zero ideal. 

But wait, actually, in the quotient ring Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r, the maximal ideal is generated by (X - p), and the other ideals are the powers of the maximal ideal. So the ideals are (X - p)^k for k = 0, 1, ..., r. But (X - p)^r is zero, so the ideals are (X - p)^k for k = 0, 1, ..., r-1. Wait, but in the quotient ring, (X - p)^r = 0, so the ideal (X - p)^k for k ≥ r is just zero. Therefore, the ideals in the quotient ring are the images of the ideals (X - p)^k for k = 0, 1, ..., r. But when k = r, it's zero. So the non-zero ideals are (X - p)^k for k = 1, ..., r-1, and the maximal ideal is (X - p). 

Therefore, in this quotient ring, every ideal is a power of the maximal ideal. Hence, the ring is a chain ring, where the ideals are totally ordered by inclusion. In such a ring, every ideal is principal because it's generated by a single element, the power of the maximal ideal. Therefore, Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r is a principal ideal ring. 

But wait, is this true? Let me check with r=1. For r=1, the quotient ring is Q_p[X]/(X - p), which is isomorphic to Q_p, since X ≡ p mod (X - p). So Q_p is a field, hence every ideal is principal (only the zero ideal and the entire ring). For r=2, the quotient ring is Q_p[X]/(X - p)^2. The maximal ideal is generated by (X - p), and the only ideals are (0), (X - p), and the entire ring. So in this case, both (0) and (X - p) are principal. For r=3, similarly, the ideals are (X - p), (X - p)^2, and (0). So all ideals are principal. 

Therefore, in general, for any r ≥ 1, the quotient ring Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r is a principal ideal ring because all its ideals are powers of the maximal ideal, which is principal. Hence, R = Q_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r is isomorphic to Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r, which is a principal ideal ring. Therefore, the answer should be yes, the ring is principal for all integers r ≥ 1. 

But wait, hold on. Is Q_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r really isomorphic to Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r? Let me verify this. In the formal power series ring Q_p[[X]], when we quotient by the ideal generated by (X - p)^r, we get a ring where the image of X is congruent to p modulo the ideal. Therefore, any element in the quotient ring can be written as a polynomial in X of degree less than r, evaluated at X = p. Wait, no. Actually, in the quotient ring, the image of X is congruent to p, so X ≡ p mod I. Therefore, X^2 ≡ p^2 mod I, X^3 ≡ p^3 mod I, etc. Therefore, in the quotient ring, the elements are the polynomials in X of degree less than r, but with X replaced by p. Wait, that can't be right. 

Wait, maybe not. Let me think again. If we have a ring homomorphism Q_p[[X]] → Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r, defined by sending X to the equivalence class of X in Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r. But in Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r, X is congruent to p. Therefore, this map would send X to p. Therefore, the image of X in the quotient ring is p. Therefore, in the quotient ring R, we have X ≡ p mod I. Therefore, X - p is congruent to zero, so X = p + higher terms. Therefore, elements of R can be written as power series in X where each term is a coefficient times (X - p)^k, but since we are modding out by (X - p)^r, the higher terms beyond r are zero. 

But this seems different from the polynomial quotient. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Let me recall that in the formal power series ring Q_p[[X]], the quotient by (X - p)^r is not the same as the polynomial quotient, but in this case, because (X - p)^r is a monic polynomial, the quotient ring is isomorphic to Q_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r ≅ Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r. Because in the formal power series ring, any element can be written as a polynomial plus a multiple of (X - p)^r, so the quotient is the same as the polynomial quotient. Therefore, R is indeed isomorphic to Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r. 

Therefore, since Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r is a principal ideal ring, as all its ideals are powers of the maximal ideal, then R is principal. Hence, the answer is yes, the ring is principal for all r ≥ 1. 

Wait, but let me test with r=2. Take R = Q_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2. In this ring, the elements are equivalence classes of power series where two power series are equivalent if their difference is divisible by (X - p)^2. Let's take two elements, say, X and p. In R, X ≡ p mod (X - p)^2. Therefore, X = p + a(X - p)^2 for some a in Q_p[[X]]. Similarly, X^2 = p^2 + 2p(X - p) + (X - p)^2. So in R, X^2 = p^2. Therefore, the ring R is isomorphic to Q_p[X]/(X - p)^2, where X is congruent to p. Therefore, in R, the elements are of the form a + b(X - p) where a, b ∈ Q_p. Then, the multiplication is such that (a + b(X - p))(c + d(X - p)) = ac + (ad + bc)(X - p) + bd(X - p)^2 ≡ ac + (ad + bc)(X - p) mod (X - p)^2. Therefore, the ring R is isomorphic to Q_p[X]/(X - p)^2, which is a two-dimensional Q_p-vector space with basis {1, X - p}. 

In this ring, the ideals are: 

- The zero ideal. 
- The ideal generated by (X - p). 
- The entire ring. 

But wait, actually, in the quotient ring Q_p[X]/(X - p)^2, the ideals are: 

- The zero ideal. 
- The principal ideal generated by (X - p). 
- The entire ring. 

Therefore, every ideal is principal. Similarly, for higher r, the ideals are generated by (X - p)^k for k from 1 to r. Therefore, all ideals are principal. 

Therefore, in general, for any r ≥ 1, the ring R = Q_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r is isomorphic to Q_p[X]/(X - p)^r, which is a principal ideal ring. Hence, the answer is yes, the ring is principal for all r ≥ 1. 

But wait, let me think again. Is there a case where this might not hold? For example, suppose r is not 1. Let me take r=3. Then, the ideals in the quotient ring would be generated by (X - p), (X - p)^2, and (X - p)^3 (which is zero). So again, all ideals are principal. 

Alternatively, maybe if the ring was not a quotient by a principal ideal, but in this case, we are quotienting by a principal ideal generated by (X - p)^r. Therefore, the quotient ring has the property that all ideals are principal. 

Therefore, the conclusion is that the ring is principal for all r ≥ 1. 

But let me check another perspective. The ring R is a quotient of a principal ideal ring (since Q_p[[X]] is a principal ideal ring, being a local ring with a unique maximal ideal generated by X). However, when we take a quotient by an ideal, the quotient ring may not be principal. However, in this case, the ideal (X - p)^r is principal, and the quotient is a local Artinian ring. In such a ring, if the maximal ideal is principal, then the ring is a chain ring, hence all ideals are principal. 

Yes, in a local Artinian ring with principal maximal ideal, every ideal is principal. This is a standard result. For example, in the ring Q_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r, the maximal ideal is generated by (X - p), which is principal. Therefore, all ideals in such a ring are powers of the maximal ideal, hence principal. Therefore, R is a principal ideal ring for all r ≥ 1. 

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the ring is principal for all r ≥ 1.

To determine whether the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\), we start by analyzing the structure of the tensor product and the quotient.

1. **Tensor Product Analysis**:
   - The ring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) is the ring of formal power series over the p-adic integers \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\).
   - Tensoring \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\) with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) over \\( \\mathbb{Z} \\) results in a ring that is isomorphic to \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\). This is because tensoring with \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\) inverts the element \\( p \\), converting the coefficients from \\( \\mathbb{Z}_p \\) to \\( \\mathbb{Q}__p \\).

2. **Quotient Ring Structure**:
   - The ideal generated by \\( (X - p)^r \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]] \\) is considered. Here, \\( X - p \\) is a formal variable minus a constant in \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p \\).
   - The quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local Artinian ring. This ring can be viewed as a truncated polynomial ring where \\( X - p \\) is a nilpotent element.

3. **Principal Ideal Check**:
   - In the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\), the maximal ideal is generated by \\( \\epsilon = X - p \\). This ideal is principal, and all other ideals are powers of this maximal ideal.
   - For each \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is a local ring with principal maximal ideal, and hence all ideals are principal.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the quotient ring \\( \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r \\) is principal for all \\( r \\geq 1 \\), the original ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is also principal.

Thus, the ring \\( \\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r} \\) is principal for all integers \\( r \\geq 1 \\).

","Okay, let me try to figure out whether the ring \\(\\frac{\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p}{(X - p)^r}\\) is principal for all integers \\(r \\geq 1\\). Hmm, principal rings are those where every ideal is generated by a single element. So, I need to check if every ideal in this quotient ring can be generated by one element. 

First, let me recall what \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p\\) is. The tensor product here is over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), so we're taking the formal power series ring over the p-adic integers \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\) and tensoring it with \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\). I think this should result in a ring that's similar to \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\), because tensoring with \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) would invert the element \\(p\\), turning \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\) into \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\). So maybe \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\)? Let me check that.

Yes, when you tensor \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]\\) with \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) over \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\), since \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\) is a \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-module and \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) is a \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-module via the inclusion \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}_p\\), the tensor product should be \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\). Because in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]]\\), each coefficient is in \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\), and tensoring with \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) would replace each \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\) coefficient with a \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) coefficient, hence making the entire ring \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\). So that part makes sense.

Therefore, the original ring in question is \\(\\frac{\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]}{(X - p)^r}\\). Now, I need to determine if this quotient ring is principal for all \\(r \\geq 1\\). 

Let me first think about what \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r\\) looks like. The ideal generated by \\((X - p)^r\\) in the formal power series ring \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\) is the set of all formal power series where the first \\(r\\) coefficients of \\(X\\) are zero when expanded around \\(X = p\\). Wait, actually, in \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\), the element \\(X - p\\) is a formal variable minus a constant. Maybe it's better to perform a change of variables. Let me set \\(Y = X - p\\). Then, \\(X = Y + p\\), and the ring becomes \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]\\). The ideal generated by \\(Y^r\\) is then the set of formal power series where the first \\(r\\) coefficients are zero. The quotient ring \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^r)\\) is isomorphic to the polynomial ring \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r)\\), which is a local ring with maximal ideal \\((Y)\\) and nilpotent elements \\(Y, Y^2, \\ldots, Y^{r-1}\\).

But in this case, the quotient ring \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^r)\\) is a truncated polynomial ring modulo \\(Y^r\\), which is a local Artinian ring with maximal ideal \\((Y)\\). Now, in such a ring, all ideals are powers of the maximal ideal. Therefore, the ideals of \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[Y]]/(Y^r)\\) are \\((Y)^k\\) for \\(0 \\leq k \\leq r\\). Each of these ideals is principal, generated by \\(Y^k\\). Hence, the ring is principal because every ideal is generated by a single element.

Wait, but hold on. Is that correct? Let me verify. If we have the ring \\(R = \\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r)\\), then the ideals are indeed \\((Y^k)\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., r\\). So each ideal is principal, generated by \\(Y^k\\). Therefore, \\(R\\) is a principal ring. Therefore, the original quotient ring \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r\\) is principal. Therefore, the answer should be yes, it's principal for all \\(r \\geq 1\\).

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the tensor product. I assumed that \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p \\cong \\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\). Let me confirm this. Since \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\) is a \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-module, and \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) is a \\(\\mathbb{Z}\\)-module via the inclusion \\(\\mathbb{Z} \\subset \\mathbb{Q}_p\\), then the tensor product \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p[[X]] \\otimes_\\mathbb{Z} \\mathbb{Q}_p\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\). Because in the formal power series ring, each coefficient is a \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\) element, and tensoring with \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) replaces each \\(\\mathbb{Z}_p\\) coefficient with a \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\) coefficient. Therefore, the entire ring becomes \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\). So that part is correct.

Therefore, the quotient ring is \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r\\), which is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r)\\) with \\(Y = X - p\\). As established, this ring is local and Artinian, with all ideals principal. Therefore, the ring is principal for all \\(r \\geq 1\\).

But wait, let me think again. If we have a ring that is a quotient of a principal ideal ring, is the quotient necessarily principal? Not necessarily. For example, \\(\\mathbb{Z}[x]/(x^2)\\) is not a principal ideal ring. But in this case, the base ring \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\) is a complete discrete valuation ring, but actually, no, \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\) is a formal power series ring, which is a local ring, but is it a principal ideal ring? Wait, in a principal ideal ring, every ideal is principal. In \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\), the ideals are generated by powers of \\(X\\), but actually, no, in the formal power series ring, the ideals are generated by monomials in \\(X\\), but in this case, since we are modding out by \\((X - p)^r\\), which is a different ideal. Wait, but in the quotient ring, the ideals are the images of the ideals in \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\) containing \\((X - p)^r\\). However, in the quotient ring, the ideals are the images of the ideals in \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\) that contain \\((X - p)^r\\). So, for instance, if we have an ideal in \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]\\) that contains \\((X - p)^r\\), then its image in the quotient is an ideal in the quotient ring. But in the quotient ring, all ideals are generated by powers of \\(X - p\\), which is \\(Y\\). Wait, but in the quotient ring \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^r\\), the elements are formal power series in \\(X\\) where the coefficients are in \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\), but modulo \\((X - p)^r\\). So, if we write \\(X = Y + p\\), then each element can be written as a polynomial in \\(Y\\) of degree less than \\(r\\), with coefficients in \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\). Therefore, the quotient ring is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^r)\\), which is a polynomial ring modulo \\(Y^r\\), which is a local ring with maximal ideal \\((Y)\\), and all ideals are \\((Y^k)\\) for \\(k = 0, 1, ..., r\\). Therefore, each ideal is principal, generated by \\(Y^k\\). Therefore, the quotient ring is indeed principal.

Therefore, the answer should be yes, the ring is principal for all \\(r \\geq 1\\).

But let me check for a specific example. Take \\(r = 1\\). Then the quotient ring is \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)\\). This is isomorphic to \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\), since evaluating at \\(X = p\\) would give a quotient map to \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p\\), and since \\(X - p\\) is a non-zero divisor, the quotient is a field. So, fields are principal rings because their only ideals are (0) and the entire ring, both of which are principal. So that works.

For \\(r = 2\\), the quotient ring is \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[[X]]/(X - p)^2\\). Let me see. If we set \\(Y = X - p\\), then the ring becomes \\(\\mathbb{Q}_p[Y]/(Y^2)\\). The elements are of the form \\(a + b Y\\) where \\(a, b \\in \\mathbb{Q}_p\\). The ideals here are (0), \\((Y)\\), and the entire ring. The ideal \\((Y)\\) is generated by \\(Y\\), which is principal. So, again, all ideals are principal. Therefore, the ring is principal.

Similarly, for higher \\(r\\), the structure is similar: each ideal is generated by \\(Y^k\\), so principal. Therefore, regardless of \\(r\\), the quotient ring is principal. 

But let me think if there's a case where this might not hold. Suppose \\(r\\) is such that the ring is not a domain. Wait, but even if it's not a domain, as long as all ideals are principal, it's a principal ring. In the case of \\(r \\geq 2\\), the ring is not a domain (since \\(Y^r = 0\\), so it has zero divisors), but it's still a local Artinian ring, and in such rings, all ideals are principal. Wait, is that true? Not necessarily. For example, in a product of fields, which is a commutative ring, you can have non-principal ideals. But in a local Artinian ring, every ideal is contained in the maximal ideal, and since the maximal ideal is principal, and the ring is Artinian, the chain of ideals must stabilize, so each ideal is a power of the maximal ideal. Therefore, if the maximal ideal is principal, then all ideals are principal. 

Yes, in a local Artinian ring with principal maximal ideal, all ideals are principal. So since in our case, the quotient ring is a local Artinian ring with principal maximal ideal \\((Y)\\), then all ideals are principal. Therefore, the ring is principal for all \\(r \\geq 1\\).

Therefore, after all these considerations, I think the answer is yes, the ring is principal for all integers \\(r \\geq 1\\).

\\boxed{Yes}
