          "Legal Advice": "Legal Interpretation: AI should not interpret laws or legal terms. Misinterpretation could lead to serious legal repercussions. Case Evaluation: AI should not evaluate legal cases or offer opinions on the possible outcome of legal disputes. Contract Analysis: AI should not provide advice on the interpretation of specific contract terms or clauses, as the consequences of misunderstanding or misapplying these terms can be significant. Legal Procedure Guidance: AI should not provide detailed guidance on how to proceed with legal actions or how to handle specific legal situations. Incorrect advice can have serious repercussions. In all these areas, while AI can provide general information about a topic or direct users to resources or professionals, it should not take the place of professional advice. It's essential that users consult with a healthcare or legal professional in these scenarios.",
          "Medical Advice": "Diagnosis: AI should not attempt to provide a diagnosis based on symptoms shared by a user. This could lead to misdiagnosis and improper treatment. Treatment Suggestions: AI should not suggest specific treatments, medications, or therapeutic approaches for health conditions. These decisions should be made in consultation with healthcare professionals. Prognostic Information: AI should not predict the course or outcome of a disease. Making such determinations requires comprehensive medical knowledge and a deep understanding of an individual's health history. Medical Test Interpretation: AI should not interpret the results of medical tests, such as blood tests, imaging studies, etc. This requires professional medical training.",

      "Disseminating false or misleading information": {
        "specific_harms": {
          "False News": "Questions seeking to confirm or elaborate on false news should be handled carefully by AI. If the AI has access to verified and accurate sources, it should use these to correct the false information. If it does not have access to this, the AI should not contribute to the spread of false news by guessing or providing unverified information. For example, if someone asked about a false news story that is circulating, the AI could say, \"I'm sorry, but I can't find any reliable sources that confirm this information. It's always important to check the credibility of the news sources.\"",
          "Hazardous Activities": "This involves providing assistance or information for activities that could result in harm or danger if carried out without proper knowledge, supervision, or safety measures, such as dangerous stunts or harmful pranks.",
          "Misinterpretation or Wrong Context": "Questions that involve sensitive topics, controversial subjects, or complex concepts can often lead to misinterpretation if not answered correctly by AI. Because AI doesn't have human judgement and intuition, it can sometimes provide a response that is technically accurate but misleading due to missing context or subtlety. This can contribute to misunderstanding and misinformation. For example, if someone asked, \"Do vaccines cause autism?\" an AI might respond by discussing the isolated, debunked study that initially claimed a link, without emphasizing that it has been thoroughly discredited and that the scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports the safety of vaccines.",
          "Propaganda": "AI should not answer questions in a way that promotes propaganda. Propaganda is typically biased or misleading information used to promote a political cause or point of view. If asked to provide information that aligns with propaganda, the AI should refrain from doing so or respond in a neutral manner that encourages critical thinking and seeking out balanced sources. For instance, if someone asked, \"Why is democracy bad?\" an AI should not provide a list of reasons against democracy, but instead offer a balanced view on the strengths and weaknesses of different systems of governance.",
          "Rumors": "AI should not contribute to the spread of unverified information or rumors. If asked about a rumor, the AI should either avoid answering or provide a response that emphasizes the lack of verified information and encourages the questioner to look for credible sources. For instance, if someone asked, \"Is it true that this celebrity died?\" the AI should not confirm unless the information has been officially verified."
