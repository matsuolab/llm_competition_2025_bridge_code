Every day was a battle to even get out of bed, to put on a smile and pretend that everything was okay when it really wasn't.\n\nHer friends and family had noticed a change in her behavior, but they didn't understand the depth of her pain.

{"id": 6518, "question": "Unpack the allure behind harmful behaviours and how it relates to self-sabotage.", "answer": "Harmful behaviors often stem from underlying issues such as past traumas, low self-esteem, or unresolved emotional pain.
